Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (PTPA) on\nDecember 21, 2006. On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F), and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action\nwas taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on November 5, 2008. She\nrequested a decision in her case without a hearing. DOHA mailed a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM- information provided to an applicant to support the allegations of the\nSOR) to Applicant on January 22, 2009. She received the FORM on January 26, 2009.\nHer response to the FORM, which was received on March 13, 2009, has been admitted\nMarch 30, 2009\n\n The question requires information about whether the applicant has filed for bankruptcy, or been the subject\n1\nof a tax lien or legal judgment in the last 7 years. \n The question also requires the applicant to disclose any obligations funded or guaranteed by the federal\n2\ngovernment. \n2\nin evidence. I was assigned the case on March 27, 2009. Having considered the entire\nrecord, Applicant\u2019s request for employment in a public trust position is denied. \nRulings on Procedure\nPursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17. of DoD Directive 5220.6, section 3 of Item 6 (response to\ninterrogatories), p. 6, is amended by changing the date of February 2, 2007 to\nDecember 21, 2006. This change is made to conform the SOR to the correct date\nApplicant signed her PTPA. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations because Applicant owes nine\ndelinquent accounts totaling $19,396. She admitted all the financial allegations. The\nSOR also alleges personal conduct based on a for PTPA signed by Applicant on\nDecember 21, 2006, where she disclosed a judgment in response to question 22.a.,1\nbut answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 22.b., requiring information about debts at least 180 days\ndelinquent.  Applicant acknowledged she omitted the financial information. \n2\nApplicant is 51 years old, and has been married since February 1985. She has\ntwo children. She has been employed by a defense contractor since 1988. Currently,\nshe is a Quality Analyst II. She seeks a sensitive position.\nFinancial Considerations\n\u00bb SOR 1.a. is a judgment amounting to $6620. The original creditor reported this\naccount delinquent in August 2004, and sold the account to a collection agency in\nNovember 2006. A judgment was filed against Applicant in December 2007 (Item 7).\nShe claimed in her response to the FORM (March 13, 2009) that she was negotiating\nwith a collection firm, and had reached an agreement to pay the balance in 30 days.\nApplicant still owes this account. \n\u00bb SOR 1b. through SOR 1e. are four medical accounts for $63, $71, $64, and\n$51, respectively. These accounts fell delinquent between 2003 and 2005. In July 2008,\nApplicant indicated in Item 6 (responses to interrogatories) she intended to contact the\ncreditor for payment. She provided no information of taking action on these debts. SOR\n1.b. through 1e. are found against Applicant. \n\u00bb SOR 1.f., $811. The mail catalogue account was opened in 1998 and became\ndelinquent in 2004. Applicant is still responsible for this account. \n\n The date appearing in Item 6 (Responses to Interrogatories) is incorrect. After reviewing Item 5 (PTPA), the\n3\ncorrect date is December 21, 2006, and page six of Item 6, section 3 is amended by changing the date\nFebruary 2, 2007 to December 21, 2006.\n3\n\u00bb SOR 1.g. This credit card account of $2,024 reached delinquent status in\nNovember 2001. The account was purchased by a collection agency on February 2008.\nApplicant received an offer of settlement from the creditor, which she attached to her\nresponse to the FORM on March 13, 2009. In the offer of settlement, the collection\nagency offered Applicant an opportunity to settle the account for $1,012. Applicant\nstated she would be taking advantage of the offer in 30 days. There is no evidence that\nApplicant accepted the offer by paying the settlement amount. This account is resolved\nagainst Applicant. \n\u00bb SOR 1.h. This credit card account of $3,867 was posted delinquent in March\n2002. Applicant provided no information about this account and/or what she intends to\ndo to satisfy the creditor. She remains responsible for the past due debt. \n\u00bb SOR 1.i. is a credit card account amounting to $5,815 that became delinquent\nin September 2006. The past due debt is found against Applicant. \nIn her responses to interrogatories dated July 15, 2008, Applicant provided proof\nshe satisfied an unlisted debt of $764 in May 2008, and that she was current on her\nother debts. \nThe record is silent on whether Applicant has had financial counseling. Also, the\nrecord contains no information explaining Applicant\u2019s financial habits. On July 15, 2008,\nApplicant submitted a financial profile statement (PFS) with her responses to\ninterrogatories (Item 6). She stated her total net income a month is $7,146, after adding\nher net monthly income ($1,217) to her husband\u2019s monthly income of $5,829. She also\nindicated her monthly expenses totaled $1,426. After subtracting her monthly expenses\nof $1,426 from her total net monthly income of $7,146, the net monthly income (before\nmonthly debts are subtracted) is $5,720. After subtracting monthly debts of $1,151 from\n$5,720, the net monthly remainder should equal $4,569. I do not know why Applicant\u2019s\ncomputations total a smaller net monthly remainder of $3,073. The significance of\nApplicant\u2019s PFS is that she has more than $3,000 in discretionary income (earnings that\ncould be applied for any purpose) available every month after the payment of monthly\nexpenses and debts. \nPersonal Conduct\nOn December 21, 2006, Applicant certified and signed a PTPA. In response to\nquestion 22.b. of the form requiring information about debts at least 180 days\ndelinquent, Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In Item 6 (July 15, 2008),  Applicant stated in\n3\nresponse to why she omitted the overdue debts from her PTPA. She stated, \u201cThe debts\nlisted were several years old, and I wasn\u2019t aware they were still listed (Id.).\u201d The debt in\nSOR 1.i. became delinquent about three months before Applicant signed her PTPA in\n\n4\nDecember 2006. The past due debt in SOR 1.f. became delinquent in July 2004. I find\nshe intentionally falsified her PTPA on December 21, 2006.\nPolicies\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of\nDefense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered\ninto a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which gave DOHA the responsibility to\nprovide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel working on unclassified\nInformation Systems Positions as defined in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January 1987.\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the\nsecurity guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . .\nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive\nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d The Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline. In determining whether the applicant qualifies a sensitive position under the\ntrustworthiness standard, the applicant must be provided the due process procedures\ncontained in DoD Directive 5220.6.\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of each security\nguideline, the general factors of the whole person concept should be applied in deciding\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant an applicant eligibility\nfor assignment to sensitive duties. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. These guidelines are\nflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The\nadministrative judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense\ndecision. According to the AG, the entire process is a careful, thorough evaluation of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\n\n5\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship is not restricted\nto normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock responsibility\nbetween an applicant and the federal government. The government reposes a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nA person who occupies a public trust position has a duty to show she or he can\nbe trusted to handle the responsibilities of the job. An applicant also has a duty to\ndemonstrate she can be trusted to properly handle various responsibilities in her\npersonal life. Depending on the issues involved in public-trust-position cases, a person\nhas a duty to obey the law. She also has a duty to refrain from drug use and/or alcohol\nabuse. Further, an applicant has a duty to be candid and forthright during all phases of\na security investigation, including job applications and interviews. Finally, an applicant\nhas a duty to demonstrate she handles her personal, financial obligations in a\nresponsible manner. This means that an applicant must pay all voluntarily incurred\ndebts in a prudent and prompt manner, rather than allow the debts to fall delinquent\nand/or become judgments that can expose the debtor to garnishment. \n\n6\nThe SOR shows that Applicant owes 9 debts totaling $19,396, and has not\nrepaid the debts. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) applies due to Applicant\u2019s inability and/or unwillingness to pay the listed\ndebts. FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) applies as the credit\nreport shows that the debts fell delinquent between 2002 (SOR 1.h.) and September\n2006 (SOR 1.I).\nI have carefully evaluated the mitigating conditions under the FC guideline. I\nhave concluded that Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR, her 20 years of employment, and\nher two-page statement in response to the FORM are not sufficient to qualify her for a\nposition of trust. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment) has only partial application. While five of the debts are dated, meaning that\nthey became delinquent more than five years ago, the delinquent credit card account in\nSOR 1.i. converted to that status about three years ago. Also, the judgment in SOR 1.a.\nwas filed in December 2007. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay any of the debts generates\ncontinuing doubt regarding her judgment and reliability. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) does not apply to the circumstances in this case. Applicant has been\nmarried since 1985, and has worked for her current employer since 1988. She reported\nno unanticipated events in her life, e.g., sickness or unemployment, that prevented her\nfrom paying her debts.\nApplicant is unable to take advantage of FC MC 20.c. (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) as well. Without evidence of financial\ncounseling, there is no credible method to determine the strength of Applicant\u2019s financial\nhabits. Without a plan to address the debts, I am unable to conclude Applicant has her\nfinancial obligations under control. \nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) applies when there is evidence to show payment of\ncreditors. Conversely, a claim of negotiating with creditors or receiving some offer of\nsettlement has no probative value unless there is matching evidence of payments.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly remainder of more than $3,000 convinces me she has the\nwherewithal to address the delinquent debts. For example, payment of the four medical\ndebts would have provided some evidence Applicant is serious about eliminating her\npast due debt. Saving $1,000 of her monthly remainder for six months would have\nallowed her to pay off five or six of the listed debts. Applicant\u2019s inaction, specifically\nsince July 2008, supports a finding against her under the FC guideline. \n\n7\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to the financial question 22.b. (debts at least 180 days\ndelinquent) of her PTPA in December 2006 was a deliberate falsification of relevant\nfacts as defined by PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission, falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness). There is no limiting language within question 22b. of the PTPA that\nrestricts the applicability of the question to a certain period of time. For example, the\nquestion does not only apply to recent debts. Rather, it applies to any debts more than\n180 days overdue. By stating she did not provide the debt information because the\ndebts were several years old, Applicant applied a rationalization of age for concealing\nthe debt information. However, the debt in SOR 1.i. became delinquent only three\nmonths before she submitted her PTPA. Viewing the totality of the circumstances, I\nconclude she deliberately falsified the application. \nI have carefully considered the following mitigating conditions to determine\nwhether Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions are mitigated: PC MC 17.a. (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). \nPC MC 17.a. does not apply because Applicant never made any prompt, good-\nfaith attempt to correct the false information. Her admission to omitting the financial\ninformation did not come until she was confronted with the omission in July 2008. PC\nMC 17.c. does not apply as Applicant attempted to conceal nine debts when she\ncertified and signed her PTA in December 2006. Her falsification of material information,\nwhich is interpreted as an effort on her part to misrepresent her financial status, raises\nongoing concerns about her judgment and reliability. \nFinally, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) has only limited\n\n8\napplication. Applicant acknowledges she intentionally provided false information on a\nPTPA in December 2006. Applicant\u2019s admission and remorse for omitting the\ninformation, while providing some mitigation, does not entitle her to the full application of\nPC MC 17.d. Furthermore, the limited mitigation Applicant receives under PC MC 17.c.\nand 17.d. is insufficient to prevail over PC DC 16.a.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate findings against Applicant under the FC and PC guidelines. I have also\nweighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nApplicant owes a total of $19,396 for nine delinquent debts. Some of the debt is\nmore than five years old and may no longer be enforceable by the state limitations\nstatute that require creditors to bring action against debtors within a certain period of\ntime. However, the limitations statute does not assist Applicant anyway as she has done\nnothing to address any of the nine debts. At age 50, when Applicant prepared her PTPA\nin December 2006, she was placed on notice that the government was concerned about\nher debts. Two months before her 52  birthday, Applicant was provided more specific\nnd\nnotice by the government of her financial problems, and the measures she had or had\nnot taken to deal with the debts. Yet, her response to the FORM shows her first signs of\naction to pay off these listed creditors. The presence of an offer of settlement or an\nintention to pay in the future does not, however, have the same mitigating value that\nevidence of actual payment does, particularly in Applicant\u2019s case with a large monthly\nremainder that Applicant has chosen not to apply to her delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s\n20-year history of employment with her company has been carefully examined, but\nprovides no insight into her overdue indebtedness, and failure to make any effort to\nrepay the debt. With no payments or plan to address her debts, and her deliberate\nfalsification of her delinquent debts, Applicant has not met her burden of showing under\nthe FC and PC guidelines that she is eligible for a public trust position.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 25-year-old price authorization contractor for a pharmacy benefit company who seeks a trustworthiness determination. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant recently married (in March 2008) and has three children (see exs. 6 and 7). When she completed her questionnaire for a public trust position in April 2007, she was still unmarried and residing with her fianc\u00e9 at the time (see exs. 6 and 7). Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts between 2004 and 2006. Six of the listed debts involve consumer accounts in collection status and exceed $24,000.00 in the aggregate. A seventh debt is a listed judgment for $1,955.00 that was entered in July 2004. She attributes some of these debts to actions of her ex- boyfriend. She blames this boyfriend for wrecking her car, and causing it to be impounded. She did not have the money to release the car from impound and assumes it was repossessed. This creditor filed suit against her and before her trial date arranged a payment agreement with Applicant. When she could not make the monthly payments with her limited income, she stopped making payments altogether. The delinquency on this repossessed car (creditor 1.d) is $16,689.00 and remains unpaid (see ex. 7). Two of Applicant\u2019s other listed delinquent accounts involve utility debts that she admits to owing (creditors 1.b and 1.g). When asked ab",

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn November 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of Applicant eligibility for occupying a public trust\nposition position, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a trustworthiness determination should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 30, 2008, and elected to have her\ncase decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on February 10, 2009, and did not respond with any information.  The\ncase was assigned to me on April 15, 2009.   Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMay 12, 2009\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) had a judgment taken against\nher in July 2004 for $1,995.00 and (b) accumulated six delinquent debts exceeding\n$24,000.00.  For her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.\nShe claimed she was prioritizing her bills in order to pay off as much as she could, and\nthat she had made much improvement on her debt.  She claimed, too, that she was\nshowing a willingness to satisfy her debts and should not be doubted as a trustworthy\nperson. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 25-year-old price authorization contractor for a pharmacy benefit\ncompany who seeks a trustworthiness determination.  The allegations covered in the\nSOR and admitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant recently married (in March 2008) and has three children (see exs. 6\nand 7).  When she completed her questionnaire for a public trust position in April 2007,\nshe was still unmarried and residing with her fianc\u00e9 at the time (see exs. 6 and 7).  \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts between 2004 and 2006.\nSix of the listed debts involve consumer accounts in collection status and exceed\n$24,000.00 in the aggregate.  A seventh debt is a listed judgment for $1,955.00 that\nwas entered in July 2004.  She attributes some of these debts to actions of her ex-\nboyfriend.  She blames this boyfriend for wrecking her car, and causing it to be\nimpounded.  She did not have the money to release the car from impound and assumes\nit was repossessed.  This creditor filed suit against her and before her trial date\narranged a payment agreement with Applicant.  When she could not make the monthly\npayments with her limited income, she stopped making payments altogether. The\ndelinquency on this repossessed car (creditor 1.d) is $16,689.00 and remains unpaid\n(see ex. 7).  \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s other listed delinquent accounts involve utility debts that she\nadmits to owing (creditors 1.b and 1.g).  When asked about them in her Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) interview in August 2007, she indicated she intended  to\npay both creditors, but had not yet contacted them (see ex. 7).  One of the other listed\ndebts involves a consumer charge account (creditors 1.c). Applicant indicated an\nintention to pay this account, but could provide no time estimate of when the account\nmight be satisfied.  Applicant\u2019s remaining two accounts (creditors 1.e and 1.f) comprise\nstudent loans that she has no immediate plans to satisfy without more detailed\ninformation about the accounts and additional funding (see exs. 6 and 7).\nApplicant provided no endorsements or performance evaluations in her behalf.\nNor did she provide any proofs of community and civic contributions.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the  judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\n\n4\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose\nof establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation,\nextenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an employee of a pharmacy benefit contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts (to include an adverse judgment) during periods of\nunderemployment.  All of her listed debts remain unresolved at this time. \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to address\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\u00b6 20(b).\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to her holding low paying jobs and\nprioritizing with her limited income.  Her largest debt (a deficiency resulting from a car\nrepossession) was initially prompted by a former boyfriend\u2019s damaging her vehicle and\ncausing it to be impounded.  She accepts full responsibility, though, for her inability to\ncure the charges associated with the impounding and avoid repossession.  Applicant\naccepts responsibility, too, for each of her other listed debts.  At this time, however,\nshe lacks the necessary information and income to satisfy these debts with the\nbudgeted resources she has established for herself. \nWithout any documented payment history or plan to resolve her listed debts,\nApplicant cannot be credited with any manifest progress to date in regaining control of\nher finances.  Further, she provides no hard assurances of any commitment to resolve\nher debts in the foreseeable future.  Applicant\u2019s finances still require a good deal of\neffort on her part to fully stabilize them. \n\n5\nBased on her evidentiary showing, some extenuating circumstances are\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s inability to take care of her past debts.  Available to\nApplicant is MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibility.\u201d   Judgment problems\nassociated with her debts preclude her from fully invoking MC \u00b6 20(b) to her benefit. \nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant based on the evidence developed\nin this administrative record.  Not only are her listed debt delinquencies ongoing, but\nshe has failed to address them in any tangible way.  \n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by her accumulation of delinquent debts.  To date, she\nhas not shown any manifest effort in addressing any of her covered debts to mitigate\nher still delinquent accounts.  So, even though Applicant has been able to make\nprogress with her other accounts, her efforts do not enable her to establish judgment\nand trust levels fully compatible with her occupying a trustworthy position at this time.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances\nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources she has had to\naddress them with, and the absence of any corrective actions to address her old\ndebts, it is still too soon to make safe predictive judgments about her ability to repay\nher old debts and restore her finances to stable levels commensurate with her\nholding a trustworthy position.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in\nthe context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed\nabove, I make the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCES):         \nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n6\n   \nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.g:\nAgainst t Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a public trust position.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied. \n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline C is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant asks that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision be reversed, arguing that\nhe is willing to renounce his Mexican citizenship.   Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that\n1\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n__________\nDecision\n__________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Foreign Preference\n(Guideline C). Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn February 26, 2007, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF\n86). On July 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\nmodified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C.\nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nJanuary 14, 2009\n\n2\n                                     \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on\nAugust 4, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on October 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5,\n2008, for a hearing on November 18, 2008, and it was held on that day. \nAt the hearing, the government offered two exhibits (Exhs.) that were admitted in\nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted no exhibits at the hearing but testified\non his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 26,\n2008. At the request of Applicant, the record was held open for 30 days and three\nevidentiary documents were submitted within that time and admitted without objection. \nProcedural Rulings\nNotice of Hearing\nThe hearing notice was dated less than 15 days before the hearing date. I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated\nhe was ready to proceed (Tr. 7).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the factual allegations of the SOR in his answer but\ndenied the general allegation that he has a preference for a country other than the U.S.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 41-year-old heavy equipment operator employed by a government\ncontractor since 2007 who was born in Mexico. His father was a laborer in the harvests\nin the U.S. at various locations. The family decided to stay in the U.S. Applicant\nobtained an associate\u2019s degree from a technical college in 1987. He obtained a green\ncard in 1978 and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. \nWhen Applicant was married in 1991, his wife owned some property in Mexico\nonly a few miles from the U.S. border. In 1994 he built a house on the property using his\nmoney. He was, at that time, working for a U.S. company that had business in Mexico\nand he often traveled there for work (Tr. 35). He obtained a Mexican national identity\ncard identifying his Mexican parentage to facilitate travels to Mexico for his work (Tr. 22\nand 60). He has not had a Mexican passport since becoming a U.S. citizen (Tr. 66). \nIn 2003 he applied for and received Mexican citizenship. He acknowledged this\non his SF 86. The reason for so doing was so that he could legally assume ownership of\nthe house, and be able to sell the house at a future time since Mexico requires property\nowners to be citizens (Tr. 36). He was also fearful about his investment since, because\nof the Mexican law requiring ownership, squatters claim such property and it is difficult\nto evict them. He is now trying to sell the house through advertisements in local\n\n3\n                                     \nMexican newspapers (Exh. A). The value of the property is between $30,000 and\n$50,000. He owns a home in the U.S. valued at $140,000 and intends to buy another.\nIn 2006 he voted in the Mexican elections (Tr. 26). That election was a general\nelection with candidates for president as well as local officials. The principal reason he\nvoted was to have some influence in the selection of local officials who would be\ndeciding municipal issues. He also voted for one of the presidential candidates in the\nsame election (Tr. 27). He regularly votes in all U.S. elections (Tr. 30). \nApplicant has expressed a willingness to revoke his Mexican citizenship (Tr. 49).\nHe has a strong preference for U.S. citizenship based on having lived here for 30 years\nand love for the country (Tr. 30). He has met with the Mexican consulate in the city\nwhere he lives to explore revocation of Mexican citizenship. However, he does not want\nto revoke until he can sell the property in Mexico (Tr. 34). He is somewhat fearful of\ndiscussions with the consul at this time as he feels they may cause some difficulties for\nhim or the property if he should revoke his citizenship now (Tr. 52-53). When he\nbecame a Mexican citizen again in 2003 and voted in the 2006 election he was not\nemployed by a defense contractor and had no idea these actions might later jeopardize\nhis work. \nApplicant has three children who are 18, 14 and 2. He has another who is 18 by\nanother woman for whom he pays child support. He has never served in the military in\neither the U.S. or Mexico. He is an hourly worker with an annual income of\napproximately $60,000. He does not hold a security clearance but was given an interim\nclearance soon after filing his application for a security clearance. It was revoked when\nthis matter arose (Tr. 68). He does not have access to classified information but needs\na clearance to have access to the military installation where he works. \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors who describe him as loyal,\ncompetent, and hard-working (Exhs. B and C). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\n                                     \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\nAnalysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude that the following Adjudicative Guidelines provide the standard for\nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nGuideline C Foreign Preference\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with\nrespect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: \n\n5\n                                     \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG \u00b6 9: \n\u201c[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nAG \u00b6 10 describes possible conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or\nother such benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business\ninterests in another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nThe fact that Applicant has used foreign citizenship to protect financial interests\nin a foreign country by becoming a citizen of Mexico, and by voting in a foreign\nelection to influence the outcome of local elections to protect property interests have\nraised security concerns under Sec. (a). (5) and (7). of the guideline.\n\n6\n                                     \nAG \u00b6 11 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns\n(MC):\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or\nbirth in a foreign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when\nthe individual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant\nsecurity authority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United\nStates Government.\nThe only possible MC applicable is paragraph (b) since he has expressed\nsuch a willingness to revoke his Mexican citizenship. However, he has placed\nconditions on doing so, namely the sale of the property in Mexico. The Appeal Board\nhas held in a similar case also involving Mexico that a person owning property there\nwho expressed a willingness to revoke but declined to do so to protect property\ninterests had placed conditions that were not consistent with the requirement of\nwillingness to revoke (ISCR Case No. 01-16098 Appeal Board May 29, 2003).\nAlthough Applicant has taken some steps to sell the property which would\nremove the condition, that has not yet happened. Thus, his intent remains conditional.\nAs long as he owns the house he likely will have dealings with officials in Mexico, and\nhe is fearful of repercussions if it becomes known that he is renouncing his citizenship.\nSince the Applicant\u2019s vote in a foreign election was not encouraged by the U.S. that\nMC is not applicable. \nI place no emphasis on the fact that he was initially a citizen of Mexico by\nvirtue of his parentage, but only on actions he has taken after becoming a U.S. citizen.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n7\n                                     \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference allegations. While there is no reason\nother than the dual citizenship and voting to question Applicant\u2019s ability to hold a\nsecurity clearance, his refusal to revoke his Mexican citizenship until he sells his\nproperty places a condition on the willingness to revoke and precludes a finding in his\nfavor. While Applicant took these actions which cause him to be denied a security\nclearance before his employment by a defense contractor, he has chosen a course\nthat protects his foreign property interests and is unwilling to take steps to reverse\nthose actions at this time. There is no reason based on the facts that are known that\nhe should not receive a security clearance at some future time when he can do so\nwithout fear of losing his investment or his property. While he is making efforts to\nresolve the issue through sale of the property, that has not occurred as yet. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and\nsupporting evidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative\nprocess, and interpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has\nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude\nhe is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline C: AGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant \n Subparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant\n Subparagraph 1.e.:  Against Applicant\n\n8\n                                     \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant at this time. Clearance is denied.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 25 years old, holds an associate\u2019s degree in computer programming and hopes to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in the next two years. He has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2001, and currently holds the position of software developer (Tr. 93-96). Applicant started consuming alcohol approximately once per month at about the age of 17. After turning 21, his use increased when he started going to bars. He became intoxicated about once per month, on weekends, after approximately six beers. In October 2006, he and a friend went to two bars and he drank approximately ten beers over the course of about four hours. After leaving the bar, he was stopped by police and failed the field sobriety test. He was arrested, spent several hours in jail, and was charged with Driving/Attempting to Drive Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol, Driving while Impaired by Alcohol, and Negligent Driving. Applicant informed his supervisor about his arrest, and his supervisor wrote a letter of recommendation for Applicant's court hearing. 2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Kathleen E. Voelker, Esq. \n \n \n \n________________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for alcohol \nconsumption and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nApplicant submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 3, 2007 and on July 24, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nOn December 31, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nof the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed his notarized Answer to \nthe SOR on January 29, 2009, in which he admitted to all allegations in the Statement of \nReasons under Guideline G and denied the two allegations under Guideline E. He also \nrequested a decision before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on March 20, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on March 25, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 24, 2009 and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on May 14, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted. Applicant testified and presented the \ntestimony of four witnesses. Applicant exhibits (AE) A through I, were admitted. He \noffered two documents for administrative notice, identified as Administrative Hearing \nExhibits (AHE) I and II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 26, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 25 years old, holds an associate\u2019s degree in computer programming \nand hopes to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in the next two years. He has been \nemployed by the same defense contractor since 2001, and currently holds the position of \nsoftware developer (Tr. 93-96). \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol approximately once per month at about the \nage of 17. After turning 21, his use increased when he started going to bars. He became \nintoxicated about once per month, on weekends, after approximately six beers. In \nOctober 2006, he and a friend went to two bars and he drank approximately ten beers \nover the course of about four hours. After leaving the bar, he was stopped by police and \nfailed the field sobriety test. He was arrested, spent several hours in jail, and was \ncharged with Driving/Attempting to Drive Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol, \nDriving while Impaired by Alcohol, and Negligent Driving. Applicant informed his \nsupervisor about his arrest, and his supervisor wrote a letter of recommendation for \nApplicant's court hearing.  \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \nApplicant's attorney arranged a plea bargain under which Applicant would \nparticipate \nin \na \n12-week \nalcohol \neducation \nprogram, \nand \nplead \nguilty \nto \nDriving/Attempting to Drive Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol. On January 11, \n2007, he pled guilty to the charge and the remaining charges were not prosecuted. \nApplicant received Probation before Judgment. The court ordered him to complete the \n12-week alcohol program. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended. His driving \nprivileges were restricted for 45 days to work, school and alcohol classes. He was placed \non unsupervised probation for two years, which he completed in January 2009 (GE 2, 4, \n5; Tr. 39, 96-100, 104). \n \nApplicant began the alcohol education classes in January 2007. He was not \nrequired to attend consecutive weeks, and completed the program in August 2007.3 He \ndid not receive individual or group counseling. He did not attend Alcoholics Anonymous \nmeetings because he did not believe he had a problem controlling his alcohol use. He \nwas not diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or as alcohol-dependent. His prognosis upon \ncompletion was \u201cGood.\u201d Applicant listed his DUI arrest on his security clearance \napplications of May 5, 2007 and July 24, 2007 (GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE F; Tr. 100-105). \n \nIn June 2007, while on vacation, Applicant and his friends were drinking at a bar. \nApplicant consumed \u201cprobably not even six beers\u201d between 8 p.m. and 2.a.m. He and his \nfriends took a bus back to their hotel room. While he was sitting in front of his room with \na beer in his hand, talking to several people, the police arrived and arrested everyone in \nthe group. Applicant testified that he was not intoxicated when he was arrested. He \nremained in jail overnight. The next morning, \u201cThe commissioner said that I could do 20 \nhours of community service and I would not be charged.\u201d Applicant performed the \ncommunity service by working in a homeless shelter. The shelter forwarded paperwork \nto the court reporting completion of the required hours. Applicant was not required to \nappear in court and in July 2007, he received notice from the district court that the \ncharge would not be prosecuted. He did not report the open container charge to his \nsupervisor at the time it happened. He testified that he did not know he was required to \nreport it because he did not think the open container charge was criminal (GE 4, 5; Tr. \n106-113). \n \nApplicant believes that he did abuse alcohol in the past. Following the DUI arrest, \nhe decided to decrease his alcohol consumption. He has not been intoxicated since that \ntime, and does not drive after consuming alcohol. He volunteers to be the \u201cdesignated \ndriver\u201d if his friends drink so they do not have to drive. His sister, who is also his \nroommate, confirmed Applicant\u2019s decreased alcohol consumption in her testimony. They \nhave not kept alcohol in their home since New Year\u2019s Eve of 2007-2008. She does not \ndrink alcohol. The friends with whom Applicant drank alcohol are also now drinking less \nor not at all. After August 2008, Applicant eliminated alcohol use entirely because of the \neffect it could have on his career. He found that eliminating alcohol from his life was not \ndifficult. He expects that he will occasionally drink alcohol in the future on special \n3\n                                                 \n3 Applicant mistakenly entered October 2007 as the completion date in his response to Interrogatories, \nGE 2 at page I-16. The correct date of August 8, 2007 appears on the supervisor\u2019s status report in GE 2 \nat page I-20. \n \n\n \noccasions. Since he stopped frequenting bars, he spends his free time involved in four-\nwheeling and video gaming. He is also more focused on his career. He has been \nassigned new responsibilities, including overseeing the work of junior developers (GE 5; \nAE H, I; Tr. 83, 88-89, 105-106, 120-128).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his first security clearance application in 2004, and received \nan interim security clearance. In early 2007, a new Assistant Facility Security Officer \n(FSO) joined Applicant's company. He testified at the hearing that he discovered \nApplicant's security application had not been processed to completion. When he \nchecked on the status, he was told to have Applicant re-submit an application. Applicant \ncompleted this second security clearance application on May 5, 2007, and was granted \nan interim clearance on May 14, 2007. After a short time, the Assistant FSO learned that \nthis second application contained an error related to the signature. He instructed \nApplicant to re-submit his application to correct the signature error. In his Interrogatory \nresponse, Applicant stated, \u201cHowever, I was instructed by my FSO to fix only the \ncorrections identified by them. For example, I was instructed to resign the SF86 to \ninclude my middle initial in the signature. I was not under the assumption nor was I \ninstructed to update my SF86 with new information.\u201d Applicant completed his third \napplication online. Most of the information he provided in the May 5 application, such as \nemployment and residences, still appeared in the online version. However, the \ncheckmarks he had inserted for all the \u201cYes/No\u201d questions did not carry over. He re-\nentered his \u201cYes/No\u201d responses and submitted this third application on July 24, 2007. \nApplicant's arrest on the open container charge occurred June 9, 2007, which was after \nthe May 5 application, and before the July 24 application (GE 1, 5; AE F; Tr. 48-57, 73). \nHe testified he did not list it on his application of July 24, 2007 because,  \n \nI was not aware the open container violation was a charge. I didn't  \nunderstand. I never pled guilty to it. I never went to court for it.  My \nunderstanding was if I completed community service I would  have  \nnothing to worry about and I would not have to think about it  again.  \n \n \n(Tr. 117). \n \nThe Assistant FSO testified that, before he assumed the position of Assistant FSO \nin early 2007, the company had no policy or training regarding what information should \nbe reported. Although employees with final security clearances received an online \nbriefing for holders of full security clearances, holders of interim clearances did not \nreceive training in reporting requirements. As a holder of an interim clearance, Applicant \ndid not receive such training before submitting any of his security clearance applications \n(Tr. 52-53, 70).  \n \n \nThe Assistant FSO also testified that when he told Applicant to re-submit the \napplication on the July 24, 2007, \n \nA The only thing I told him to do was update the information that was in the \nJPAS system and check the yes or no boxes. \n4\n \n\n \nQ And when you say update the information in the JPAS system, what does \nthat mean? \nA The error that I got sent back. \nQ The signature error? \nA Yes sir. (Tr. 66-67) \n \nWhen asked if it was appropriate for Applicant to omit the open container arrest on his \napplication, the Assistant FSO responded,  \n \nNo sir, I don't believe it was appropriate for him not to  disclose that  \nbut under the instructions that I gave him, at this time, after the fact, \nwere vague, I don't believe he knew to put that in there. (Tr. 61). \n \nAs part of his security clearance investigation, Applicant was interviewed by an \ninvestigator on October 11, 2007. On January 23, 2008, Applicant had a second \ninterview, which focused on the open container charge. When asked why he did not list \nthe incident on his security clearance application, Applicant stated that he filled out the \nMay application before the incident occurred, and it was subsequently returned for \ncorrections, and was not completed until after the incident (GE 5). \n \n \nApplicant did not report the open container incident to his supervisor when it \nhappened for the same reason as on his security clearance application: he thought it \nwas not a crime and therefore, he was not required to do so. Applicant reported the open \ncontainer charge to his supervisor on the day of the second security interview. He told \nthe Assistant FSO about the charge when the Assistant FSO helped him answer the \nDOHA Interrogatories in October 2008. Applicant testified that he did not deliberately \nconceal the information either on his July application or in his first interview (GE 5; Tr. \n54-55, 112-114, 119-120). \n \nApplicant's performance evaluations for 2005 through 2008 indicate that he was \npromoted from programmer to software developer, and that he received increasing \nnumbers of \u201cExcellent\u201d ratings during that time. Applicant's friend, who has known him \nfor ten years, testified that several years ago, she used to see Applicant about four times \nper week when they would go to bars with friends. However, since the DUI, she sees him \nonly about once per month because he no longer goes to bars with the group. She \nconsiders him to be completely trustworthy, and has given him a key to her home (Tr. \n77-83). Another close friend of ten years, who used to be a drinking companion, \nsubmitted a letter stating that Applicant now rarely goes to bars with their friends, and \nhas not been intoxicated since the DUI. His supervisor of more than three years testified \nthat Applicant is now a role model for younger staff. Although his supervisor admitted \nthat Applicant's not disclosing the open container charge raised questions, he has never \ndoubted Applicant's honesty and integrity. He has seen Applicant at company social \nfunctions where alcohol is available, but has never seen him consume alcohol. Applicant \nis allowed to work from home because of his reliability. The Assistant FSO testified that \nApplicant is a very honest and trustworthy person. Friends and a co-worker also \n5\n \n\n \nsubmitted letters attesting to Applicant's honesty and integrity. Applicant has received \nnumerous performance awards from 2003 through 2008 (AE A through E, G-I; Tr. 35-44, \n55-56, 66).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nthe cited guidelines.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to \ndeny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must \nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its \nburden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.7 \n \n6\n                                                 \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). \n \nAG \u00b6 22 includes the following relevant conditions that can raise security \nconcerns and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n \nApplicant pled guilty to DUI in 2006 and was charged with possessing an open \ncontainer of alcohol in public in 2007. In addition, he consumed alcohol to the point of \nintoxication, on weekends, about once per month, starting at about age 21. These facts \nsupport application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that can mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \nApplicant had a DUI conviction and another alcohol-related charge about eight \nmonths later. These events occurred in 2006 and 2007, between two and almost three \nyears ago. After the DUI, Applicant realized that he must change his behavior. He \ndecreased his consumption, did not drink to intoxication, did not drive after drinking, \nstopped frequenting bars, and limited his association with people with whom he drank \nalcohol in the past. These changes reflect favorably on his good judgment, and make it \n7\n \n\n \nunlikely he will be involved in future negative alcohol-related events. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. \n \nApplicant completed a 12-week alcohol program, and his prognosis was reported \nas \u201cGood.\u201d Although he was not diagnosed as either an alcohol abuser or alcohol-\ndependent, Applicant believes that he did abuse alcohol in the past, and in summer \n2008, he decided to further curtail his use of alcohol. As of the date of the hearing, he \nhad not had alcohol since August 2008. Although he expects that he will have it at times \nin the future, it will be on infrequent special occasions. Based on Applicant's changed \nbehavior, and his record of responsible alcohol consumption over the past two years, \nAG \u00b6 23(b) applies. I find for Applicant on Guideline G. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his answer to question 28(f) \non his July 24, 2007 security clearance application, which implicates AG \u00b6 16(a), and \nthat he deliberately failed to disclose the same violation during his first security \ninterview, which involves AG \u00b6 16(b). Application of these two disqualifying conditions \nrequires a deliberate intent to conceal. Here, Applicant did not intentionally hide relevant \ninformation from the government.  \n \n8\n \n\n \nApplicant submitted two applications, one on May 5 \u2013 before the open container \nviolation occurred \u2013 and one on July 24, after the violation. He listed the alcohol arrest \non the first application, but did not list the open container arrest when he re-submitted \non July 24. As holder of an interim clearance, Applicant had no training in reporting \nrequirements, and did not realize he needed to list the open container violation. He was \nconfused about the legal nature of the incident because it did not result in a court \nhearing, a plea, or similar proceedings that would indicate to him it was a criminal \noffense. Moreover, he was not informed that he should enter new information on the \nJuly 24 application. The Assistant FSO credibly testified that he provided \u201cvague\u201d \ninstructions on how to complete the July 24 form, and based on those instructions, he \nwould not expect Applicant to have known that the incident should be listed. Applicant \nalso did not disclose the open container charge when he met with the investigator for \nhis first security interview because he did not realize that the violation was criminal. It \nshould be noted that when he did know that he committed a criminal offense\u2014the \nDUI\u2014he revealed it, both in his application, and in his first security interview. \n \nIf Applicant had intended to conceal his alcohol-related involvement with the \npolice, it is unlikely he would have disclosed his arrest for DUI in the May 5, 2007 \napplication, and in his first interview. Thus, Applicant disclosed a more serious violation. \nHe recognized it as criminal conduct, because it involved retaining an attorney, \nappearing in court, probation, and attending an alcohol program over a period of several \nmonths. Applicant also disclosed other alcohol-related information in the application, \nand in his first interview, when he listed his alcohol classes and provided details about \nwhy he had attended that program. Applicant's disclosure of his DUI put the government \non notice that alcohol use was an issue to be further investigated. I conclude Applicant \ndid not have the requisite intent to establish deliberate falsification of his security \nclearance application or the information he provided to the investigator. AG \u00b6 16 (a) and \n(b) do not apply. As there was no intent to falsify, mitigation is not required. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n9\n \n\n \n \n10\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old, and his DUI occurred when he was 22. His decision to  \nincrease his alcohol consumption once he turned 21 stemmed, in part, from his youth \nand immaturity. His choice resulted in a DUI. Subsequently, Applicant participated in a \n12-week education program, after which he received a prognosis of \u201cGood.\u201d He took \nstock of his situation and made positive life changes by limiting his alcohol consumption, \navoiding drinking to intoxication and driving after drinking, avoiding spending his time in \nbars on weekends, limiting his association with those with whom he drank alcohol, and \nbecoming involved in sports. Although he was never diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol-dependent, and is not required to be abstinent, his decision to abstain from \nalcohol for the past nine months shows serious commitment to avoiding the mistakes of \nthe past. Applicant disclosed his DUI and alcohol classes during his security processing. \nHis failure to list his open container violation resulted from his belief that it was not \ncriminal in nature, as well as vague instructions from his Assistant FSO. If he had \nwished to deceive, he would not have disclosed the DUI. Applicant's supervisor, co-\nworker, friends, and Assistant FSO attested to his trustworthiness. He has had no \nalcohol-related incidents in the past two years, and his behavior changes since the DUI \nmake future incidents unlikely.   \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.d. \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nFOR Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.b.  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n_____________________________________ \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  \nEligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because her SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on an unspecified date. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated September 20, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 2, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard on December 8, \n2008. It was reassigned to me on January 5, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued on January 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as \nscheduled, on January 27, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, four Government exhibits and seven Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on February 5, 2009. \n \nThe record was kept open until February 10, 2009, to enable Applicant to \nsupplement the record.  Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and, on February \n10, 2009, she submitted one additional document (marked as Applicant Exhibit H) which \nwas admitted into evidence without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a majority of the factual allegations \nin the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., 1.e. through 1.l., 1.n., and 1.o.). She denied the remaining \nallegations. \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she is seeking \nto obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  She currently \nholds an interim clearance. Applicant has never been married,1 but does have three \nchildren born in 1998, 2001, and 2005, respectively.2 As of January 27, 2009, she \nresided with her children and fianc\u00e9, the father of her youngest child.3 She has been \ngainfully employed by the same defense contractor since October 2007, and currently \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated November 9, 2007), at 16. \n \n2 Id. at 19-20. \n \n3 Tr. at 51-52.  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nserves as a purchasing agent.4 Her previous employment included a lengthy period \n(2001-07) as a customer service representative.  She was unemployed for a two month \nperiod in 2007.5  \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant\u2019s finances commenced a downward spiral, but the \nvarious credit reports in evidence would seem to indicate her problems started about \nthe time some accounts were sent to collection as early as 2003-04. Part of her financial \ndifficulties arose from her immaturity and fiscal irresponsibility,6 and part arose from her \ngullibility in permitting her former fianc\u00e9 to purchase items on her joint or individual \ncredit only to resell them for cash which he then used for his own purposes. Applicant \napparently ignored her debts, and, as a result, several accounts became delinquent and \nwere either \u201ccharged off\u201d or placed for collection. With additional maturity and a growing \nsense of responsibility, and after completing her e-QIP, she eventually came to the \nrealization that her actions were inappropriate. In an effort to correct her financial \ncircumstances, she turned to a credit counselor for financial guidance in late November \nor early December 2007.7 She was told to continue ignoring her delinquent debts until \n2010, at which time those debts would drop off her credit report.8 Not feeling \ncomfortable with such guidance, she ignored it and commenced her initial efforts of \naddressing those delinquencies.9 \n \nThe first step in her effort to correct and reestablish credit occurred in early 2008, \nwhen she called most of her identifiable creditors to verify her responsibility for the \naccounts and their balances, and try to negotiate reduced balances and payment \nterms.10 In conjunction with her efforts to take care of her outstanding debts, Applicant\u2019s \nfianc\u00e9 pays the current bills such as rent, utilities, and those requiring immediate \nattention.11   \n \nThe SOR identified 16 purportedly continuing delinquencies. She disputed \nresponsibility for one account, claiming it was a joint account she had with her father, \nand it had been discharged by her father\u2019s bankruptcy in 2003-04.12 Some of the \naccounts have been paid off and others are in the process of being paid under an \n \n4 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 11-12. \n \n5 Id. at 13. \n \n6 Tr. at 22-23. \n \n7 Id. at 50. \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Id. at 51. \n \n10 Government Exhibit 2 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated June 4, 2008). \n \n11 Tr. at 51-52. \n \n12 Id. at 29-30.  With a joint account, it should be noted the father\u2019s bankruptcy only discharges his liability, \nand not hers. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nagreed payment plan. She also disputed several accounts as being the responsibility of \nher former fianc\u00e9, and believes several of the SOR allegations refer to duplicate \naccounts.   Those debts listed in the SOR, and their respective current status, according \nto the credit reports, and Applicant\u2019s comments regarding same, are described below: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS \n1.a. \nTelephone service \n$690 \nCollection.

In September 2008, Applicant entered into negotiations with the collection \nattorneys representing the creditor, and later that month, paid the agreed outstanding \nbalance in full.15 \n \nSOR & 1.c. refers to a credit card that became delinquent. The account was \ncharged off.16 Prior to November 2007, Applicant attempted to negotiate payment \narrangements with the creditor, but her efforts to do so were thwarted when the creditor \nrefused to accept less than the entire balance in one lump sum payment.17 She intends \nto pay the outstanding balance after she has resolved some of the other debts.18 \n \nSOR & 1.d. refers to an automobile loan Applicant and her former fianc\u00e9 \nobtained for his automobile.  The original loan was for $10,000, and monthly payments \nwere apparently made by her former fianc\u00e9 for an unspecified period before ceasing. \nThe account eventually went into collection and was charged off,19 and the vehicle was \nrepossessed and subsequently sold at auction,20 leaving a deficiency balance of \n$2,317. All the correspondence, including the collection correspondence, was mailed to \nhis address, and Applicant was unaware that the payments had stopped, or the vehicle \nhad been repossessed.21 Applicant and the attorneys for the creditor agreed to an initial \npayment plan, and she made monthly payments for about one year before finding \nherself unable to continue. When she asked her former fianc\u00e9 for assistance, he agreed \nto make some payments, but he failed to follow through.22 Another payment plan was \ncommenced in May 2008, when she made an initial payment of $1,100, and that plan \nhas continued with monthly payments of $100 being made by her.23 She intends to \n \n14 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 10, at 5. \n \n15 Applicant Exhibit D (Letter from Collection Attorneys, dated September 25, 2008). \n \n16 Government Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated November 13, 2008) at 1. \n \n17 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 30. \n \n18 Tr. at 26. \n \n19 Government Exhibit 3 (Combined Credit Report of Experian, Trans Union, and Equifax, dated December \n5, 2007), at 6. \n \n20 Id. at 27. \n \n21 Id. \n \n22 Id. \n \n23 Applicant Exhibit F (Correspondence and receipts, various dates). \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ncontinue making her monthly payments on schedule and hopes to accelerate them \nwhen she is able to do so.24 \n \n SOR && 1.e., 1.k., and 1.n. refer to medical bills which should have been timely \nsubmitted to MEDICAID by the billing departments of the medical providers, but were \nnot.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon \na finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d64   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d65 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \n \n60 Id. at 42. \n \n61 Id. at 53. \n \n62 Applicant Exhibit G (Performance Evaluation, dated December 30, 2008), at 4. \n \n63 Department of the Navy v.

The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.66  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d67 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d68 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v.

Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit \nreports, answer to the SOR, her answers to interrogatories, and the evidence, including \nher testimony, presented during the hearing. The Government has established AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c).   \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nIn addition, when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b) may apply. Evidence that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating \nunder AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@69 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively, timely, and responsibly to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. Those delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under \n \n69 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Initially, she lacked the income to pay some of her debts, but \nwith counseling and greater maturity, she commenced negotiations with creditors and \nstarted paying her SOR debts. While it may have taken some time, this 26-year old \nApplicant matured and eventually established that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.71  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant sought financial counseling and guidance \nin late November or early December 2007, well before the issuance of the SOR. She \nwas told to continue ignoring her delinquent debts until 2010, at which time those debts \nwould drop off her credit report.  But to her credit, and not feeling comfortable with such \nguidance, she ignored that irresponsible advice and commenced her initial efforts of \naddressing those delinquencies.  There are now \u201cclear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control.\u201d She understands the security implications of her \nearlier inaction pertaining to delinquent debt and intends to scrupulously avoid future \ndelinquent debt. \n \nShe has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant showed \ngood faith in her efforts to resolve her SOR debts.  She has established a reasonable \nplan to continue to do so.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n70 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd.

I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my analysis below.      \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. As noted above, part of \nher financial difficulties arose from her immaturity and fiscal irresponsibility, and part \narose from her gullibility in permitting her former fianc\u00e9 to purchase items on her joint or \nindividual credit only to resell them for cash which he then used for his own purposes. \nApplicant also apparently ignored her debts, and, as a result, several accounts became \ndelinquent and were either \u201ccharged off\u201d or placed for collection. She has admitted to \nhaving been financially irresponsible and gullible as a young adult.  She ignored her \nvalid debts and they became delinquent. Most of the delinquent accounts were sent to \ncollection or charged off, and in one instance, a motor vehicle was repossessed.  \n The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nWith additional maturity and a growing sense of responsibility, and after looking at her \ncredit score and realizing she was a poor role model for her children, and \nacknowledging the fact that she was no longer a teenager,72 she eventually came to the \nrealization that her actions were inappropriate. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation, and to the contrary, she is considered a valued employee who is an \nexceptional performer. She is a law-abiding citizen. She started to address her \ndelinquent debts and has paid off some of them, has agreements to pay off others, and \nintends to satisfy any remaining debts in the near future. Her personal payment plan is \nin place and being followed, and she has no new delinquent debts. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:73 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR.

See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a high school graduate, who started attending college in 2007. She is \nnot sophisticated in the area of finance, and has experienced substantial financial \ndifficulties, primarily because of her immaturity and gullibility. She made mistakes, and \ndebts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust her. \nMoreover, with substantial maturity, she has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments by actually paying some of her delinquent SOR debts, setting up \narrangements with others, and setting up her personal plan to resolve the remaining \ndebts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude she has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n February 18, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B, C and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 27, 2008, applicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 26, 2008. Applicant did not\nsubmit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n\nThis passport will expire in 2010.\n1\nIt is not clear if the relatives to whom he refers are his in-laws.\n2\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born in Turkey. At some point he moved to the United States. He\nearned two degrees from an American university. He became a United States citizen\nand was issued a United States passport in 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, to whom he has been married since 2002, was born in Turkey\nand is a naturalized United States citizen. She, like applicant, considers herself a dual\ncitizen of Turkey and the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and siblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Turkey.\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant described his relationship with them as \u201cmerely\npersonal and based on being related through my wife.\u201d\nPrior to becoming a United States citizen, applicant possessed a Turkish\npassport. He renewed this passport in 2005,  after he had become a United States\n1\ncitizen and obtained a United States passport. Applicant used the Turkish passport to\ntravel to Turkey in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In response to interrogatories sent to him by\nDOHA, applicant stated, \u201cI am not willing to destroy, surrender, or invalidate [the Turkish\npassport] at this time. I do still have relatives in Turkey whom I visit occasionally and\nrequire my Turkish passport to travel within Turkey.\u201d2\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) in February 2007. In response to Question 17.d., which asked: \u201cIn the last\nseven years, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign\ngovernment?\u201d applicant stated \u201cno.\u201d Applicant denies he intentionally provided the false\nanswer. In his response to the SOR, he stated, \u201cI DENY that I deliberately failed to\ndisclose my possession of an active foreign passport because I interpreted the question\nas to inquiring if I had ever been issued a passport by a foreign country in the last 7\nyears to which the answer is \u2018No\u2019 since my Turkish passport had been issued in . . .\n1995 which is outside the window of 7 years.\u201d This explanation is not credible. It is\nsimply unbelievable that a man of applicant\u2019s intelligence could have misinterpreted the\nquestion as he claims he did.\nThe Government offered four official United States publications with the FORM\nthat provide relevant facts about Turkey. The Government requested that these\ndocuments be admitted into evidence. I have admitted the documents into evidence,\nand I take administrative notice of the following facts found therein:\nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multi-party parliamentary system and a\npresident with limited powers. It has a population of about 70.5 million and is a member\n\n3\nof NATO. United States-Turkish relations focus on areas such as strategic energy\ncooperation, trade and investment, security ties, regional stability, and the global war on\nterrorism. \nTerrorist bombings over the past five years have stuck religious, government,\ngovernment-owned, political, tourist and business targets in a number of locations in\nTurkey. A variety of leftist or Islamic terrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western\ninterest as well. Terrorists claiming association with al-Qa\u2019ida were responsible for\nsuicide bombings in Istanbul in 2003 that targeted Western interests. In August 2005,\nTurkish police uncovered a planned terrorist attack by a transnational group targeting\nmaritime interests in Turkey. The possibility of terrorist attacks, both transnational and\nindigenous, remains high.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b., \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual's\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\u201d may be\ndisqualifying. And, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the\nU.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by\na foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d may be disqualifying.\nApplicant has in-laws who are citizens and residents of Turkey. \u201cAs a matter of\ncommon sense and human experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person\nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s\nspouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11577 (App. Bd. Feb. 6, 2007). Applicant\u2019s statement that\nhis relationship with his in-laws is \u201cmerely personal and based on being related through\nmy wife\u201d is insufficient to rebut the presumption that he has ties of affection and\nobligation to his in-laws. This fact alone creates a potential conflict of interest and\nrequires application of the first disqualifying condition. Applicant has traveled to Turkey\nat least three times since 2000, and intends to travel there in the future to visit his\nrelatives. When applicant is in Turkey, he is potentially vulnerable to exploitation,\npressure, or coercion by the Turkish government. These facts require application of the\nsecond disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\n\n5\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d Because the evidence reveals little to nothing about applicant\u2019s contacts,\nrelationships, and sense of loyalty or obligation to his in-laws, none of the foregoing\nmitigating conditions is applicable.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10 a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member may be disqualifying. Applicant possessed and used a Turkish passport\nafter becoming a United States citizen. Accordingly, this disqualifying condition applies.\n \nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. Under Paragraph 11.c.,\nit may be mitigating if the \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country.\u201d  Because applicant\u2019s Turkish citizenship is based on his birth in\nTurkey, this mitigating condition applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\n\n6\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable.\nI considered the potentially mitigating conditions under this Guideline and\nconclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2.a:\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c., the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born in Turkey. He subsequently moved to the United States,\nattended college, and became a United States citizen in 2002. After he became a\nUnited States citizen, he voluntarily renewed his Turkish passport, and used it to travel\nto Turkey. Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship, possession and use of his Turkish passport after\nhe became a United States citizen, intention to use his Turkish passport for future travel\nto Turkey, failure to disclose his possession of the Turkish passport on the e-QIP, and\nfailure to provide details about his contacts and relationships with his Turkish in-laws,\npreclude a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for applicant to\nhave access to classified information.\nAlthough I have considered the fact that Turkey and the United States are allies,\nthis fact is not determinative. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting\nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is\nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or\ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570\nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  It is a known fact that friendly nations and allies have\nengaged in espionage against the United States.\n\n7\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT\nGuideline C: AGAINST APPLICANT\nGuideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, but did not submit any documentary evidence. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 9, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since June 2001, but he has been out of work on disability since \nOctober 2008. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1992 to 1998, and was honorably \ndischarged as a senior airman (E-4). He attended college for a period but did not obtain \na degree. He was married from 1992 until his divorce in 1999. He married again in \n2000. He has a 12-year-old child who lives with his first wife. He has a three-year-old \nchild and a 13-year-old stepchild. Both children live with him and his wife.1  \n \n \nApplicant started having financial difficulties after his divorce in 1999. His \nproblems worsened when he was laid off in 2000. He estimates that he was out of work \nfor \u201ca couple of months.\u201d He obtained other jobs but at lower salaries. Things improved \nafter he was rehired by his current employer in about June 2001. Applicant and his wife \nattempted to help her father and grandfather through some problems in about 2002 or \n2003. They rented their house to her father while they cared for her ill grandfather. Her \nfather paid them with about $3,000 in checks that were returned for insufficient funds. \nApplicant\u2019s wife lost her job sometime between 2003 and 2005. She developed \nsignificant medical problems after she was laid off. Their insurance did not cover all her \nexpenses, resulting in unpaid medical bills. She attempted to start a business but it was \nunsuccessful. She did not return to the workforce for a lengthy period. With the high \ncost of childcare, Applicant and she decided that she would stay at home with their \nyoung child.2 \n \n \nApplicant had knee surgery in October 2008. The knee became infected and he \ndeveloped complications after the surgery, requiring additional surgery. He has been \nunable to return to work because of the complications from the surgeries. He anticipates \nbeing off work for several more months. He is on long-term disability, which is \nsubstantially less than his regular salary. There have been problems with him receiving \nhis disability pay. There is a lawsuit pending against the doctor who performed his \nsurgery. There are disputes with his insurance companies as to covering the additional \nprocedures and his disability pay. The insurance companies believe that the doctor is \nresponsible because of his malpractice.3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts as listed on credit reports dated October 3, \n2007 and May 1, 2008. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all the debts \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 64-65; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 22-24, 39, 66-69; GE 1, 3. \n \n3 Tr. at 24-28, 33-39, 55. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nalleged in the SOR with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.l, and \n1.q. The total amount owed on the 16 debts that Applicant admitted owing is about \n$25,789. \n \n \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories on May 14, 2008. He \nacknowledged that he had delinquent debts. He contacted a number of his creditors. \nMost of his creditors wanted more each month for a payment plan than he could afford \nto pay. He provided documentation that he settled a $476 medical debt on May 2, 2008, \nfor $249. He settled another medical debt with the same collection company on May 2, \n2008, for $261. This is the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s. On May 2, 2008, he paid $20 to a \ncollection company on behalf of a satellite television company, and stated that he would \npay $20 per month until it was paid. This is the $159 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. He \nused a credit card to make the $249, $261, and $20 payments on May 2, 2008. He \nindicated that he set up a payment plan to pay $37 per month for three months starting \nin June 2008, to pay the $112 debt to a bank, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.t. He stated that he \nwould pay $10 per month to three other creditors.4  \n \n \nBetween May 2008 and when he had his knee operation in October 2008, \nApplicant paid in total about $75 toward his delinquent debts. He paid the $36 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, and about $39 toward his other debts.5 \n \n \nApplicant disputed owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.l, and 1.q. SOR \n\u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent debt of $2,250 owed to a bank. Applicant admitted to having \nan account with the bank and an additional account is listed on the two credit reports in \nevidence. The October 3, 2007 report lists a collection account with this bank. It lists a \nhigh credit of $2,250 with a zero balance, and states the debt was transferred or sold. \nThe May 1, 2008 credit report does not list the debt. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l list debts of \n$489 to collection companies on behalf of cable television providers. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he has never used the cable providers as cable television is unavailable \nwhere he lives. SOR \u00b6 1.q alleges a delinquent debt of $521 for a dishonored check. \nThis check was written on an old, closed account without Applicant\u2019s knowledge or \nconsent. He submitted a copy of the police report wherein he filed an affidavit that the \ncheck was forged.6  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he fully intends to pay his delinquent debts and will initiate \npayment plans once he returns to work or receives a settlement from his lawsuit. He \ncontacted a credit counseling company but the company told him that he did not have \nsufficient unsecured debt to justify their assistance. In addition to the SOR, he is several \n                                                          \n4 GE 3. \n \n5 Tr. at 43, 75-78. \n \n6 Tr. at 28-30, 40-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nmonths behind on his mortgage and child support. His wife recently obtained a part-time \njob.7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 31-32, 39, 51-55, 62. The delinquent mortgage and child support were not alleged in the \nSOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. They will be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s \noverall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n\n \n5 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved most of the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial \nissues are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s financial problems started \nwith his divorce. He was unemployed and underemployed for a period. His father-in-law \ntook advantage of him and his wife and wrote them about $3,000 worth of bad checks. \nHis wife lost her job. Applicant and his wife both had major medical issues. These all \nqualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has \nbeen unable to address his delinquent debts since his knee operation in October 2008. I \nwill base my assessment of whether he has acted responsibly on his actions prior to \ngoing on disability. When Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in May 2008, he \nprovided information that he made payments of $249, $261, and $20 to three creditors. \nAll the payments were made with a credit card, which transferred the debt to another \ncreditor. He stated he would pay $37 per month on one debt, $20 on another debt, and \n$10 per month on three other debts. He testified that he only paid about $75 between \nMay and October 2008. That is insufficient for a finding that he acted responsibly during \nthat period. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and his financial problems are far \nfrom being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. His payments are \ninsufficient for a finding that he made a good-faith effort to pay all of his delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to the paid debts. Because of the amount still owed, I \nam unable to find AG \u00b6 20(d) applicable to all his debts. \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.l, and 1.q. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is not established by the record evidence. He provided credible \ntestimony about the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l, and documentation about his dispute \nof the debt in SOR \u00b61.q. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable service in the Air Force. Applicant has suffered a series of \nunforeseen events which have devastated his finances. He has been on long-term \ndisability since October 2008. I have decided to look at the period before he went on \ndisability to determine whether he has mitigated the financial concerns. When he \nresponded to interrogatories in May 2008, he established that he made three payments \ntoward his debts, but the payments were made by credit card. He promised that he \nwould pay $87 per month toward five debts, but only paid a total of about $75. \nApplicant\u2019s actions during that period do not convince me that he will act responsibly \ntoward his creditors even after he returns to work.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on August 27, 2007. After reviewing \nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn September 24, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 In her unsigned Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all \nallegations except the following: 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i., and 1.j.3 She also \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 25, 2008, and the \ncase was assigned to me the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJanuary 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 23, 2009. During \nthe hearing, the government offered seven exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and offered \nthree exhibits, which were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, and \nadmitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. On February 6, 2009, Department Counsel received Applicant\u2019s timely \nsubmission of seven additional documents, which he forwarded without objection. I \nadmitted the additional documents as AE D through J. DOHA received the transcript on \nFebruary 2, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of \nReasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President \non December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and \nthey apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant attached documents to her Answer, designated as follows: Answer Document (AD) 1: DD-214; \n2: DD-256AF; 3: October 1, 2008 credit report; 4: AF Form 2545 showing employment in Germany \nstarting in June 2003; 5: September 2008 letter re $50 payment on installment loan [1.k.]; 6: dispute \nletters to three credit reporting agencies; 7: June 1998 divorce decree; 8 - November 2004 document \ntitling car to Applicant's aunt. Applicant's Answer included a list of these documents that mentioned a \ncopy of a signature card for an active credit card account, but that item was not included in the \ndocuments I received.   \n\n \n \n3\nApplicant is 37 years old. She married in 1991 and initiated divorce proceedings \nin Okinawa, Japan in June 1998 (AD 7). She and her ex-husband have been separated \nsince that time; the divorce became final in 1999. Applicant earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree \nin psychology in 1999 (GE 1). She joined the U.S. Air Force in 1991, and was honorably \ndischarged in 2001 (AD 1 and 2). She held a security clearance during the ten years of \nher service (GE 1; Tr 6). After leaving the military, she moved to Germany, where she \ncurrently lives (Tr 31). She has been unemployed twice since leaving the military, each \ntime for approximately three months (Tr 92). Since September 2007, she has been \nemployed by two successive defense contractors as a training manager on an Air Force \nbase (Tr 5-6). She also works on base as a children\u2019s dance instructor.  \n \nApplicant's personal financial statement of June 2008 shows a gross annual \nincome of approximately $73,400 from her two jobs. Her approximate net monthly \nincome of $4,270 yields a annual net income of $51,229. After paying monthly \nexpenses of $2,540, her monthly net remainder is approximately $1,729. This \nremainder does not reflect debt payments, as Applicant indicated that her debts were \nbeing investigated by an attorney (GE 2). She does pay $100 per month on an \ninstallment loan (allegation 1.k.), and $100 per month on an unalleged debt (see \nfootnote 5). At the hearing, Applicant testified that she has very little money left at the \nend of the month after she pays her expenses (Tr 91).  \n \nIn 1999, Applicant purchased a car through a credit union at a cost of $29,000. In \nFall 2001, when she was about to move to Germany, Applicant told her aunt that she \nwas having trouble keeping up with the payments. As her aunt was interested in buying \nthe car, she told Applicant that she would take care of the car and the payments (Tr \n27; 37). Applicant executed a power of attorney so that her aunt could handle any \nmatters that arose (Tr 34). In the following years, while she was in Germany, Applicant \ndid not check on whether the payments were being made. Between 2001 and 2003, \nApplicant\u2019s aunt informed her that she was working with the lender to determine the \npurchase price, but neither the lender nor her aunt indicated that there was a problem \nwith the payments. In early 2004, Applicant learned about the delinquency. She \ncontacted the lender to request repossession, so that the car could be sold and the \nremaining debt would be less (Tr 40-41), but the lender did not repossess the car. In \nNovember 2004, the lender sold the car to Applicant's aunt for $500 (AE A).  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes an unpaid balance of $25,000 on the car \nloan (allegation 1.a.; GE 4). Applicant disputes the amount, contending that the car was \nworth substantially more than the $500 that her aunt paid. If the lender had sold it for \nmore, Applicant's deficiency balance would be lower. She submitted blue book values \nshowing that in January 2009, the model in question had a trade-in value of $2,625, and \na private-party value of $3,970 (AE B and C). Applicant states that in 2004, when her \naunt bought it, the car would have had an even higher value (Tr 29; 42-44).  \n \n\n \n \n4\nApplicant noted in her undated letter to DOHA (GE 6) and her response to DOHA \nInterrogatories in June 2008, that she was consulting an attorney to research her debts, \nand that a payment plan would be developed when that investigation was complete (GE \n2). At the hearing, she did not state that she had retained an attorney. She testified that \nshe obtained assistance from a free credit counseling service in about late 2007 or early \n2008, after her security clearance investigation had begun (Tr 47; 49; 90-91). The \ncounselor told her to report her disputes to the credit reporting agencies (Answer). \nApplicant did not consult with the counselor as to all her debts, but only the car loan (Tr \n52). Applicant did not contract with the counselor because she was advised not to begin \na payment plan until the correct car loan balance was determined (Tr 50). When she \nand the counselor contacted the lender, they were referred to the collection agency (Tr \n50). Applicant testified that the counselor sent emails to the lender. She was asked to \nsubmit copies, but she did not submit the emails (Tr 46-47). Contacts with the collection \nagency produced no results and, as of the date of the hearing, the car loan delinquency \nhad not been resolved (Tr 45-46). Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant submitted a \ndocument from the collection agency dated February 2, 2009. It shows that the balance \nstands at $29,877, and that Applicant has arranged to settle the debt for $16,000 (AE \nD). The letter outlines the first 6 months\u2019 payments of $200 per month from February \nthrough July, 2009. The document does not contain proof of any payments made. \n \nOf the 13 debts in the SOR, Applicant disputes eight, noting that she has never \nhad accounts with the creditors listed at allegations 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.i., and 1.j. She \ncontends that allegations 1.b., 1.l. and 1.m. were incurred by her husband when he \nopened accounts in her name after they had divorced. At the time they initiated divorce \nproceedings in June 1998, they agreed that any debts incurred after that date would be \npaid by the person who incurred them (Tr 54). Applicant submitted a divorce document, \nbut it does not discuss this agreement, or assignment of debts. \n \nIn 1991, Applicant was investigated for submitting false claims for temporary \nlodging while on duty overseas (all facts are from GE 7, unless otherwise noted). In \nabout September 1991, Applicant and her husband (also active-duty military) were \ntransferred to England. On-base lodging was not available except for the first night, so \nthey rented a cottage in the local area. The landlord testified during the investigation \nthat he told them the rate was 30 British Pounds Sterling (BPS) per night, plus the cost \nof utilities and telephone. During the investigation, Applicant submitted two conflicting \nwritten statements to the investigators. In her initial statement, Applicant told \ninvestigators that the landlord quoted a rate of 30 BPS per person per night. During a \nbriefing that included lodging reimbursement information, Applicant and her husband \nunderstood that, as an active-duty military couple, each of them would be paid up to 62 \nBPS per night for lodging. When they submitted their first claim with a single lodging \nreceipt, they were told that they needed to submit two receipts, one for each of them. \nThey asked the landlord for two receipts and submitted them. The reimbursement they \nreceived the following day appeared to be wrong, so Applicant followed up, and was \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \ntold that they would be reimbursed 30 to 35 BPS per person, not 62 BPS per person. \nThey would be responsible for paying anything higher than that amount.  \n \nApplicant was interviewed a second time concerning the lodging receipts she had \nsubmitted. During her second interview, she revised her statement of the facts. She \nadmitted that the landlord quoted a rate of 30 BPS per night, not per person, per night. \nWhen she and her husband discovered, after submitting their first claim, that they would \nnot be paid 62 BPS each, per night,  \n \nMy husband and I were still under the impression that a \nmistake had been made, so I somewhat decided that \nmaybe if we have another receipt since we were each \nseparate members of the military that we might both get \npaid for staying on the economy. (GE 7) \n \nApplicant and her husband returned to the landlord and asked for a second \nreceipt. He continued to supply them with two receipts from that point. They submitted \nthe second receipt, and it was accepted as indicating that the lodging charge was \u201cper \nperson.\u201d Applicant and her husband decided to continue submitting two separate \nreceipts, \u201cbecause we could not afford paying for the cottage out of our pockets when \nwe had so many other bills.\u201d4 Applicant admitted that \n \nI know that what we did was not right\u2026I know that I will have to \npay for my mistake and my husband for it too, but we really had \nour backs against the wall and though what we did was dishonest, \nit was the only thing that has helped us get through all of these \nbills and yet it still isn\u2019t enough. (GE 7) \n \nFollowing the investigation, Applicant was found guilty of submitting false lodging \nclaims and received non-judicial punishment of a reduction in grade (suspended for six \nmonths) and 30 days corrective custody. She served 10 days in corrective custody (Tr \n78). She contends that she was not guilty, and only admitted to the misconduct in her \nsecond statement because, as a young airman, she felt frightened and threatened \nduring the investigation (Tr 74-75). Applicant stated, both in her Answer to the SOR and \nat the hearing, that \u201cthey came back and subsequently dropped it when they found out \nthat it was not out (sic) fault.\u201d (Tr 75). She stated at the hearing that no charges were \nbrought against her, and that the incident was not entered into her military record or her \nperformance report. She \u201clater found out this was on our record.\u201d (Tr 78). The file does \nnot indicate that Applicant and her husband were exonerated at any time. \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s statement also discussed the financial difficulties she was having at the time. She and her \nhusband had taken advanced pay to cover old debts because they \u201cwere and are still very much in debt \nfrom coming over here.\u201d (GE 7). \n \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \n \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges the following 13 debts, totaling approximately \n$44,000, as well as the charge of submitting false claims for lodging.5 \n \n$         1.a. (car loan, $25,040) \u2013 Applicant admits that she owes the lender, but \ndisputes the amount, as discussed previously. After the hearing, she contacted \nthe collection company. On a balance of $29,877, she arranged a settlement of \n$16,000 and a payment plan of $200 per month, to begin in February 2009 (AE \nD). \n \n$ \n1.b. (credit card account, $1,245) \u2013 Applicant denies this debt. She contends \nthat it is her ex-husband\u2019s debt, and that he likely opened the account in her \nname without her knowledge, after their divorce. She was divorced in 1998 and \nthe account was opened in 2000. It is listed as an individual account in \nApplicant's credit bureau report. She did not provide documentation from the \ncreditor to show she does not owe the debt (GE 1 and 4; Tr 55-56). \n \n$ \n1.c. (loan, $595) - Applicant denies that she has had an account with this \ncompany. Her 2007 credit bureau report shows it to be an individual account, \nopened in 2000. The September 2008 credit bureau report shows it to be \u201cclosed \nor paid\u201d with a zero balance. It does not appear on the October 2008 credit report \n(GE 3 and 4; AD 3; Tr 56-57). \n \n$ \n1.d. (student loan, $1,111) \u2013 Applicant took out this loan to pay for schooling in \nthe 1980s. The debt appears in the 2007 credit bureau report, but not in the \nSeptember or October 2008 credit bureau reports. She testified that she paid it \nthrough automatic deductions from her paycheck while she was in the Air Force, \nstarting in about 1992, and satisfied the loan in 1995 or 1996. She has no \ndocumentation because it happened approximately 13 years ago. (GE 3 and 4; \nAD 3; Tr 57-58). \n \n$ \n1.e. (secured loan, $4,271) - Applicant denies that this debt because she does \nnot recognize the creditor. The account was opened in May 1999, when she was \nin Japan. Her ex-husband left Japan and returned to the United States in \nFebruary 1999, and she believes he may have opened the account without her \nknowledge. She informed the credit reporting agencies of her dispute, but \nprovided no documentation from the creditor to show that she does not owe the \ndebt. The account is listed as an individual account in the credit bureau reports \n(GE 4 and 5; AD 3 and 6; Tr 58-59). \n \n5 At the hearing, Applicant stated that she also owes a credit card debt to the military exchange system. \nThe debt of approximately $8,000 became delinquent in 2004. She testified that she discovered the debt \nin 2008, and did not believe it was her responsibility, but has been paying $100 per month since October \n2008 (AE F; Tr 84-85). This debt is not alleged in the SOR. \n\n \n \n7\n \n$ \n1.f. (telephone account, $76) \u2013 Applicant denies having an account with this \ncompany. She was living in Germany when it was opened in November 2005. \nShe informed the credit reporting agencies of her dispute (GE 1 and 4; AD 4 and \n6; Tr 59). \n \n$ \n1.g. (unsecured loan, $600) \u2013 Applicant denies this debt, claiming that she paid \nit. Her October 2008 credit report shows that the account is current and has a \nzero balance. She contacted the three credit reporting agencies and requested \nthat they remove this debt from her credit bureau report (GE 4; AD 3; Tr 60).  \n \n$ \n1.h. (student loan, $1,127) \u2013 Applicant states that she had only one account \nwith the Department of Education, and this is a duplicate of allegation 1.d. (GE 4; \nTr 60-62). \n \n$ \n1.i. (retail store credit card, $620) -  The account was opened in 1999. \nApplicant admits that she did purchase items from this retailer when she lived in \nthe United States between 1999 and 2001, but denies that she had a store credit \ncard. She testified that she contacted the credit reporting agencies and \nrequested that they remove this debt from her credit bureau report, but the letters \nshe submitted do not include this debt (GE 4 and 5; AD 6; Tr 62-64). \n \n$ \n1.j. (personal loan, $422) \u2013 Applicant denies that she had an account with this \ncompany. The loan account was opened in June 2001, just before her marriage \nin July 2001 and her transfer to the United Kingdom in or around September \n2001. Applicant was having financial difficulties at this time and had taken \nadvanced pay \u201cto cover old debts\u201d (GE 7). The debt is in the 2007 credit bureau \nreport but not the October 2008 report (GE 4, 5 and 7; AD 3; Tr 64). \n \n$ \n1.k. (installment loan, $2,780) \u2013 The original balance was $3,447. Applicant \nstarted payments on this debt in April 2006. She now pays $50 bi-monthly. As of \nJanuary 2009, the balance had been reduced to $2,406. She contacted the three \ncredit reporting agencies and requested that they update the status of this debt \non her credit bureau report (AD 3, 5 and 6; AE E; Tr 65-69). \n \n$ \n1.l. (credit card account, $4,397) \u2013 At the hearing, Applicant stated that her only \ndebt to this creditor is the auto loan (allegation 1.a.). Her ex-husband had a credit \ncard from this lender, and she was an authorized user. She claims that her ex-\nhusband kept the card when they were divorced in 1998. However, GE 4 shows \nthat the account was opened in 2000, after they were divorced. Her 2003, 2007 \nand September 2008 credit reports indicate this is an individual account. In her \nAnswer, Applicant was uncertain whether she was responsible for this credit card \ndebt. She did not include it in her letters of dispute to the credit reporting \nagencies (GE 3, 4; and 5; AD 3 and 6; Tr 69-71). \n\n \n \n8\n                                                \n\u2022 \n1.m. (credit card account, $1,774) \u2013 In her Answer, Applicant was uncertain \nwhether she was responsible for this second credit card from the same creditor \nas 1.a. and 1.l. She did not include it in her letters of dispute to the credit \nreporting agencies. However, at the hearing she stated that her only debt to this \ncreditor is the auto loan (allegation 1.a.). She claims that this second credit card \nwas also her ex-husband\u2019s, she was an authorized user, and her ex-husband \nkept the card when they were divorced in 1998. However, her 2003, 2007 and \nSeptember 2008 credit reports indicate that this is an individual account that was \nopened 1999, after they were divorced (GE 3, 4; and 5; Tr 69-71).  \n \n$ \n1.n. (false claim for lodging) \u2013 See previous discussion.  \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under a \nGuideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant.  However, \nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access \nto classified information.  In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under Guideline F (financial considerations). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest7 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.8 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \n \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n \n9\n                                                \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as her \nor her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions are relevant: AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts); AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); and AG \n1\u00b619 (d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan \nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust). The SOR alleges 13 past-\ndue debts, which amount to $44,000. The single largest debt is the car loan, with a \ncurrent balance of $29,877. Over the past five years, since it became delinquent in \n2003, Applicant failed to respond to this significant debt. Even if she did not become \naware of it until 2004, she still left it unresolved for almost five years. Other than one \npayment plan (allegation 1.k.), Applicant has done little to resolve her financial \nsituation. Finally, Applicant admitted to and was found guilty of submitting false claims \nfor temporary lodging and received non-judicial punishment for her conduct. AG \u00b619 \n(a), (c) and (d) apply.  \n \n \n \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \n10\n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. Four mitigating conditions are relevant to the facts:  \n \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b620(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are recent. Although they started becoming delinquent \naround 2000, Applicant has addressed only one debt (allegation 1.k.). She stated that \nshe paid two debts (allegations 1.d. [and duplicate 1.h.] and 1.g.) but provided no \nsupporting documentation. Although Applicant contends that she does not have much \ndiscretionary money after paying her expenses, her personal financial statement shows \nthat, in fact, she had a large monthly net remainder in 2008. The largest debt, the car \nloan, remained unresolved as of the date of the hearing, and she did not take concrete \nsteps to resolve it until after the hearing. Applicant's failure to deal with her financial \nobligations raises questions about her judgment and reliability. AG \u00b620(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant receives some credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because she worked with a \ncounselor starting in late 2007 or early 2008. However, over the year between 2008 \nand 2009, she failed to set up a car loan payment plan. The plan that she submitted \nafter the hearing is prospective. Without a record of payments made, there is no basis \non which to conclude that this large debt will be resolved, and AG \u00b6 20(c) cannot be \napplied. \n \n \nApplicant has not made a good-faith effort to meet her financial obligations. \nAlthough Applicant was in touch with a financial counselor over a period of \napproximately one year, she claims that the car loan lender and collection agency were \nunresponsive. Yet within two weeks after the hearing, Applicant negotiated a \nsettlement and payment plan (AE D). Over the past several years, Applicant has not \nmade serious good-faith attempts to resolve this debt, and AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \n \n\n \n \n11\n                                                \nApplicant disputes more than half of the debts in the SOR, which amount to \napproximately $13,400. She states that her ex-husband may have opened accounts in \nher name (allegations 1.b., 1.l., and 1.m.), but offered no evidence to show that she \ncontacted the creditors to investigate her suspicion. As to other accounts that she does \nnot recognize (allegations 1.e. and 1.j.), she again offered no proof that she contacted \nthe creditors. Although she notified the credit reporting agencies of four disputed debts \n(allegations 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.k.), she did not report all the debts she disputes. Most \nimportantly, she did not report the disputes until one year ago, after her security \ninvestigation had begun.10 For years while the debts were delinquent, she did nothing \nto respond to what she believed to be inaccuracies. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \nApplicant was charged with and found guilty of submitting a false claim for \ntemporary lodging. In her first statement to the investigators, she said she had not \nfraudulently claimed twice the amount due her. In her second statement, she admitted \nthat she had done so, because she and her husband had financial problems, including \nold debts, and they needed the extra money. In her Answer to the SOR, and at the \nhearing, she denied that she submitted false claims. The only relevant mitigating \ncondition, AG \u00b6 20(a), does not apply. Although the event did occur a long time ago, in \n1991, Applicant was found guilty of conduct involving dishonesty, which casts \nsignificant doubt on her trustworthiness. In addition, she provided contradictory \nstatements to the government\u2014first, that she did not submit false claims, and later, \nthat she did submit false claims. Both claims cannot be true; therefore, Applicant lied to \nthe government either in her first statement, or her second. Her actions in submitting \nthe false claims, and her deliberate presentation of false information to the government \neither in her first or her second statement, undermine her credibility and indicate a lack \nof reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n \n10 Although Applicant\u2019s dispute letters are undated, her counselor advised her to write to the credit \nreporting agencies (Answer), and she first started working with him in late 2007 or early 2008 (Tr 91). \nHer dispute letters were likely written around that time or slightly later.  \n\n \n \n12\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nAt the time these debts started accruing I n2000, Applicant was not young and \ninexperienced, but a mature adult of 29 years old who had married and divorced, \nearned a Bachelor\u2019s degree, and served almost 10 years in the military. She had held a \nsecurity clearance during her military service, and knew or should have known that \nfinancial problems represent a security issue. But it was not until her current security \ninvestigation raised financial issues that she consulted a counselor. Even after \ncontacting a counselor, she made no payment arrangements between late 2007 to \nearly 2009. Yet within two weeks after the hearing, she had arranged a settlement and \npayment plan. Her actions indicate that she has been responding to the security \ninvestigation process rather than to her obligation to pay her legitimate debts. Applicant \nresponded to several other debts with a simple statement that she does not recognize \nthem, unsupported by a documented effort to research and resolve them. Based on \nApplicant's lack of effort, and her past history of debt accumulation, I cannot confidently \npredict she will not continue to have financial difficulties in the future. Finally, Applicant \nadmitted to fraudulent conduct in the past, and was found guilty on a charge that \ninvolves dishonesty. She now declares that she did not engage in such conduct. Her \ncontradictory statements show that she was dishonest about her actions, either then or \nnow. In either case, she presented false information to the government, raising serious \nconcerns about her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.   \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n13\n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nOn September 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 16, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On November 16, 2009, DOHA assigned the \nMarch 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase to another administrative judge, and re-assigned it to me on December 4, 2009.  \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 18, 2009. The case was heard on \nJanuary 26, 2010, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 10 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on February 3, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant denied the three allegations in \u00b6 1 of the SOR; he \nadmitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.f, and 2.h, and denied the allegation in \u00b6 \n2.g; he admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.d, and denied those in \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and \n3.f. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact herein: \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and has been married since July 1997. In February \n2009, he was awarded custody of his 13-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. \n(AE A.) In May 2007, he began a position as a welder for a defense contractor. Before \nthat, he was unemployed for five months. From April 2003 to January 2007, he had a \nsteady position with a large contractor. He worked for eleven years as a welder for \nanother company prior to that job. He stated that he is a good, steady worker. (Tr. at \n26.)  \n \n \n  \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in 1986, at the age of 17. Initially, he drank \noccasionally, but gradually increased his consumption to a case of beer on weekends. \n(GE 4 at 6.)  He consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication.  (Id. at 9.) In 1987, he \nbegan smoking marijuana on a monthly basis. Within two to three years, he used it on a \ndaily basis. He continued to use marijuana until 2005. (Tr. at 29.)  He also occasionally \nexperimented with amphetamines, cocaine, and other illegal substances during his 20\u2019s \nand early 30\u2019s. (Answer.) He admitted that he is addicted to both alcohol and marijuana. \nHe has no intention to use either substance again. (GE 4. at 2.)  \n \n \n Applicant has a history of criminal incidents. In 1987 or 1988, he was arrested \nand charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) when he was 17 years old and \nrecently out of high school. He and his friends had been consuming alcohol at a softball \ntournament before the arrest. (Tr. at 53.) He was found guilty and placed on probation \nfor an unrecalled period of time. (GE 3 at 13.)  \n \n \nOn May 11, 1990, Applicant was charged with Theft of a Motor Vehicle, a felony. \nHe stole a car that was donated to a not-for-profit organization where he was working, \nand gave it to his sister. (Tr. at 56-57.) He pled guilty and was sentenced to five years of \nprobation. He was incarcerated for about ten days. (GE 4 at 8.) \n \n \nOn April 2, 1991, Applicant was charged with Burglary II, a felony, after he stole a \nstereo from his ex-girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend, with whom he had an altercation. Prior to being \narrested, Applicant admitted to the boyfriend that he took the stereo. (Tr. at 62.) In June \n1991, he was sentenced to 27 months incarceration, suspended, and placed on \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprobation for ten years. In order to decrease those ten years, he served one year and \none day in jail, and then a short period of probation. (GE 3 at 14; Tr. at 68.)   \n \n \nOn November 6, 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with another DWI, a \ngross misdemeanor. In January 1994, 15 months later, he pled guilty, was fined $450, \nand was sentenced to one year of confinement, followed by two years of probation. (GE \n6.) He was released from his sentence and probation in early 1995. (GE 4 at 3; GE 6.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he and friends stole items in order to support their drug or \nalcohol addictions in the early 1990\u2019s. (Tr. at 65.) In fact, when he was arrested in April \n1991, the police found a compact disc player he stole from a co-worker on January 25, \n1989. (GE 7.) Applicant has not been involved in any criminal activity since he was \nreleased from confinement and probation in 1995, about 15 years ago. (GE 3; Tr. at  \n66.)  \n \n \nOn May 16, 2005, Applicant voluntarily entered a 30-day inpatient treatment \nprogram for alcohol abuse because it (and not drugs) was creating a major problem in \nhis life, with his family, and the legal system. He did not enter treatment for drug \naddiction as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g. (Tr. at 32, 49, 50.)  At the time of his admittance into \nthe program, he received four diagnoses: Alcohol Dependence; Cannabis Dependence; \nCocaine Abuse; and Amphetamine Abuse. A licensed alcohol and drug counselor \n(LADC) documented the same diagnoses when he completed inpatient treatment on \nJune 21, 2005, and recommended that he attend 12 hours of weekly aftercare, \nparticipate in a minimum of two outside support group meetings per week, abstain from \nall mood altering chemicals, and, maintain consistent contact with a sponsor. His \nprognosis was \u201cGood.\u201d (GE 5.) He started the outpatient aftercare treatment program on \nJune 23, 2005, and completed it on October 13, 2005. His discharge diagnoses \nremained: Alcohol Dependence; Cannabis Dependence; Cocaine Abuse; and \nAmphetamine Abuse. The LADC discharged him with a \u201cFair\u201d prognosis and \nrecommended that he abstain from all mood-altering chemicals, obtain and maintain \nweekly contact with a sponsor; attend at least one support meeting a week; and follow \nthrough on recommendations of the Primary Treatment and Aftercare program. (Id.)   \n \n \nApplicant has remained drug free and sober since May 9, 2005, except for an \nincident in 2007 when he drank several beers and became intoxicated at a golf outing. \n(GE 3 at 15; Tr. at 79.). He attended a support group for six months after completing the \naftercare program in October 2005. (Tr. at 37.) He manages to remain sober and \nabstain from drugs because he is committed to sobriety and abstinence and no longer \nassociates with his previous friends. (Tr. at 38.)  Since working for the defense \ncontractor, he has had four random drug screenings.1 (Tr. at 35.)  \n \n \n \n \nIn May 2007, Applicant completed an electronic security clearance application (e-\nQIP). In response to Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity: a. Since \nthe age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any \n                                                     \n1 The record does not contain the results of the random drug screens. \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, \nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) hallucinogenic  (LSD, PCP, etc.), or \nprescription drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d In response to Section 25: Your Use of \nAlcohol: In the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, \nwine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse \nor alcoholism)?\u201d he answered \u201cyes.\u201d He disclosed the May 2005 treatment program.  \n \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about \nhis treatment for alcohol abuse and the criminal incidents that he disclosed on the e-\nQIP.  During that interview, he extensively discussed both topics, but did not mention \nanything about illegal drug use. (GE 3.) He said that he remained sober since May \n2005, except for one night when he relapsed and drank to the point of intoxication. He \ncalled his wife who drove him home. (Id. at 15.)  \n \n \nSubsequent to that interview, the Government obtained a copy of Applicant\u2019s \nDischarge Summaries from the treatment center he entered in May 2005. The \nsummaries detail Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol and chemical dependency. (GE 5.) \n \n \nOn August 2, 2008, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about his \nalcohol and illegal drug use and drafted an affidavit summarizing the interview. \nApplicant initialed each page of the affidavit and signed the last page. The affidavit \ncontains information about Applicant\u2019s treatment for substance abuse in 2005. It noted \nthat Applicant stated that he remained sober since completing the treatment program in \n2005, \u201cexcept for one incident in 2007 (precise date unrecalled) when I had one beer to \ndrink.\u201d  (GE 4 at 1.)  He asserted that he was certain that he mentioned his drug use \nduring the February 2008 interview. (Id. at 2.) \n \n \nOn June 10, 2009, Applicant completed Interrogatories related to illegal drug use. \nHe indicated that he regularly used drugs from the age of 18 to 36 years old. He noted \nthe last time he used marijuana was May 10, 2005. He admitted that he purchased \ndrugs, but never sold them.  He experimented with cocaine, crack cocaine, mushrooms, \nLSD, crank, and speed, but did not use them regularly. He stated he had no intention to \nuse illegal drugs in the future. (GE 2.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged in Paragraph 1 that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \npertinent information three times during the security clearance process: (1) in his \nanswer to Question 24 on the May 2007 e-QIP, he did not disclose illegal drug use; (2) \nduring the February 2008 interview, he did not disclose the 2005 treatment for drug \nabuse; and (3) in the August 2008 affidavit, his description of his 2007 alcohol relapse \nwas inconsistent with his prior statement about it. Applicant denied that he intentionally \nfailed to disclose requested information. (Tr. at 46.) His employer did not provide any \nassistance in completing the forms. (Tr. at 73.)  \n  \n \nApplicant testified that he misread Question 24. In his mind, all of the criminal \nbehavior, including his illegal drug use, occurred more than seven years ago. He knew \nthat the last criminal activity for which he was incarcerated occurred 15 years before \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand he simply did not think about the 2005 illegal drug usage while completing the e-\nQIP. (Tr. at 41-43, 80.) Later during his testimony, he stated that he did not try to hide \nhis past, but probably tried \u201cto block off\u201d past events from his mind, feeling that he \u201cpaid \nhis debt to society.\u201d (Tr. at 75.) \n  \n \n During the February 2008 interview, Applicant did not mention that he received \ntreatment for illegal drug abuse. He did not think that it was necessary because it was \nnot the main reason he voluntarily entered the rehabilitation program. (Tr. at 44.)   \n \n \nApplicant denied that he told the investigator who drafted the August 2008 \naffidavit that he had only one beer when he relapsed in 2007. He specifically \nremembered telling the investigator that he was intoxicated and that his wife had to \ndrive him home. (Tr. at 45). That testimony is consistent with the information he \ndisclosed during the February 2008 interview. \n \n \nApplicant was candid and remorseful about his past behavior. He takes full \nresponsibility for his conduct. (Tr. at 27.) He is \u201cnot proud of what [he] did growing up.\u201d \n(Tr. at 27.) After he was released from incarceration in 1995, he realized his mistakes \nand the importance of having physical freedom. \u201cIf I live on the straight and narrow, I \ncan have my freedom and live the dream, and my idea of a dream is my family and a \ngood job.\u201d (Id.) He admitted that he is an alcoholic and has a drug addiction. (Tr. 83.)  \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concerns pertaining to the personal conduct guideline are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 that Applicant deliberately falsified \ninformation three times during the security clearance process because he failed to \ndisclose specific information. The Government argued that those omissions were \npotential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning      \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAlthough Applicant acknowledged that he did not disclose the information, he \ndenied that he intentionally misled the Government. When a falsification allegation is \ncontroverted or denied, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it.  \nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. \n02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \nAfter listening to Applicant\u2019s testimony and observing his demeanor, I find that his \nexplanations for failing to disclose previous illegal drug usage in the e-QIP, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, is not credible. Question 24 is clear on its face. It precedes Question 25 \ninquiring about use of alcohol, in which Applicant honestly disclosed treatment for \nalcohol dependence, which co-existed with his drug abuse for over ten years according \nto his later statements. The Government established a potential disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 16(a). His reason for not disclosing drug abuse during the February 2008 \ninterview is also not credible. The fact that he voluntarily entered treatment for alcohol \nand not drug abuse, does not excuse the non-disclosure of his illegal drug behavior and \ntreatment, considering the length of time he used marijuana along with alcohol.  \nAdditionally, he used marijuana up to May 2005, about two years before he completed \nthe e-QIP, after which he participated in drug rehabilitation until sometime in 2006 when \nhe ceased going to support meetings. The evidence supports application of AG \u00b6 16(b).    \n \n \nWhile his explanations for failing to disclose information as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a \nand 1.b are not credible, Applicant\u2019s statement that the August 2008 affidavit does not \naccurately reflect his interview is credible. The information contained in the affidavit \nregarding the number of beers he had in 2007 leading to a relapse, is inconsistent with \nthe information he gave to the investigator in February 2008, when he disclosed that he \nhad several beers and became intoxicated. Given his detailed February 2008 account \nabout the circumstances underlying the relapse, the fact that he did not personally draft \nthe affidavit and his vigorous testimony denying the allegation in \u00b6 1.c, the evidence is \ninsufficient to prove that he falsified the affidavit and to establish a disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 16(b).   SOR \u00b6 1.c is found in his favor.    \nThe evidence supporting those two disqualifying conditions requires a closer \nexamination and balancing of resulting security concerns with any potentially mitigating \nmatters, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthose concerns. The guideline includes six conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from personal conduct, three of which may be applicable:   \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant did not \nvoluntarily disclose his history of illegal drug abuse. The Government learned of it after \nobtaining his treatment record for alcohol abuse and confronting him with the \ninformation. Although Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug history occurred in \nMay 2007, almost three years ago, that non-disclosure is not a minor offense because \nsuch information is essential in the determination of one\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. The evidence does not trigger the application of AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued denial that he intentionally withheld information during the security clearance \napplication process, precludes the application of AG \u00b6 17(d).    \n Guideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to illegal drug involvement: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns \nunder three Guideline H disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 25:  \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram. \nWith some regularity, Applicant purchased and used illegal drugs, including \nmarijuana, cocaine, LSD, and amphetamines, from the age of 18 to 36. The evidence \nsupports the application of AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c). The Government also argued \nthat the evidence raised a disqualification under AG \u00b6 25(e). Although Applicant was \nevaluated and diagnosed as drug dependent in May 2005, the evaluation and \ndiagnoses are documented as having been performed by a licensed alcohol and drug \ncounselor (LADC) on staff of a recognized drug treatment program and not a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW) as required under AG \u00b6 25(e). Hence, said disqualifying \ncondition does not apply.    \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline, two of which may be potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n Applicant asserted that the last time he used illegal drugs was in May 2005, \nabout five years ago. He repeatedly stated that he has no intention to use them in the \nfuture and ceased associating with those friends with whom he engaged in illegal \nactivity. There is no evidence in the record to contradict those assertions. He indicated \nthat he has undergone at least four random drug screenings for his employer. The \nevidence supports the application of AG \u00b6 26 (a) and \u00b6 26 (b) (1) and (b) (3).  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns \nunder two disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 31:  \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with criminal behavior four times between \n1987 and 1992, including felonies in 1991 and 1992. The evidence is sufficient to \nestablish AG \u00b6 31(a). Applicant\u2019s deliberate failures to disclose pertinent information on \ntwo occasion during the security clearance process, as found under Guideline E above, \nconstitute violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, a criminal statute, and raise a disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 31(c).    \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the foregoing security \nconcerns arising under this guideline: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nThe last criminal charge in Applicant\u2019s history occurred in November 1992 and \nthe sentence was completed in 1995. Approximately 15 years have passed since then, \nand the record does not contain any evidence of other criminal arrests or convictions. \nTwo of the criminal charges involved alcohol for which Applicant sought treatment in \nMay 2005. He has been married for 13 years and was awarded custody of his daughter \nin February 2009. He has a steady work history. He did not hesitate to express remorse \nover his past criminal conduct and his intent to remain sober and abstinent. AG \u00b6 32(a) \nand AG \u00b6 32(d) have application to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. However, \nthose mitigating conditions do not apply to the falsification offenses that occurred in May \n2007 and February 2008, because insufficient time has passed and Applicant strongly \ndenied the allegations, which negates potential rehabilitation.   \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 41-year-old man, who has \na history of criminal conduct, alcohol-related incidents, and substance abuse issues. \nThese problems began in 1986 and continued to 2005, when he took action to address \nhis illegal drug use and alcoholism. Since 1992 there is no evidence of criminal arrests, \nand since 2005 he has remained drug free and essentially sober, but for one relapse in \n2007. He has come to terms with his addictions, and the effect that they and his criminal \nhistory have had in his life. He is committed to living a responsible life looking after his \nfamily. His actions to change his life are laudable when considered in relationship to a \nlong history of substance abuse and prior criminal incidents.  \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s failure to be forthright in disclosing his illegal drug use in \nMay 2007 and in February 2008 is troubling. The Government would not have learned \nof the long-term drug problem if it had not secured Applicant\u2019s substance abuse \ntreatment records. At this time, the record lacks sufficient evidence of behavioral \nrehabilitation to assure the Government that a similar discrepancy will not occur in the \nnear future.  \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance at this time. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement, but not \nthose raised by his personal and criminal conduct. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraphs 3.a through 3.e:   \nFor Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 3.f   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a public trust position for her, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a public trust \nposition should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 27, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated November 17, 2008, was provided to her, \nand she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.4 A response to the FORM was due on December 25, 2008. \nApplicant did not submit any additional information for consideration. The case was \nassigned to me on February 10, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., \n1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., and 1.k. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., \n1.i., and 1.l. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old service representative.5 She attended business college \nfrom March 1991 to November 1991. She married in July 1988, and has three children, \nages 19, 17, and 10. She and her husband have been \u201cseparated for many years\u201d and \nshe currently receives intermittent child support from her husband. Her SF 85P states \nshe has been separated from her husband since April 2000. Her Response to SOR \ndoes not contain specific details regarding the amounts of child she receives or does \nnot receive.6 \n \nApplicant disclosed no police record; no use of illegal drugs; and no alcohol-\nrelated problems, counseling or treatment. She has worked for the same employer, a \ngovernment contractor, since July 2007. Applicant indicated she has held access to \nsensitive information since she began her present position. Her access has never been \nsuspended or revoked. \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3 Item 3. \n \n4 The DOHA transmittal letter is dated November 17, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on November 24, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she \nhad 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n5 Item 5, July 2007 SF 85P, is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n6 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nIn her 2007 SF 85P, Applicant disclosed several past due accounts, including a \n$9,354 student loan that had gone to collections in 1992. Additionally, her background \ninvestigation addressed her financial problems and included the review of credit reports \nfrom August 2007, April 2008, September 2008, and November 2008.7 Also, it \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s answer to DOHA interrogatories.8  \n \nThe DOHA interrogatories asked Applicant, in part, to explain and/or document \nthe status of 12 delinquent accounts, totaling $30,964.00 alleged in the SOR. Applicant \nresponded that a credit counseling service she consulted advised \u201cthat I could file for \nbankruptcy but I have decided after further review I will be working w/a credit attorney.\u201d \nShe also referred to an unspecified illness and a disability. She did not provide specific \ninformation regarding the nature, quality, or duration of her illness/disability and how \nthat may have impacted her ability to pay her debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM failed to address her indebtedness in any \nmeaningful way. She provided little or no information as to how she acquired the debts, \nwhy they became delinquent, documented efforts she has taken to resolve her debts, \nand what measures she has taken to avoid similar financial problems in the future. Her \nplan is to resolve her indebtedness through \u201ccredit repair with a credit attorney.\u201d  \n \nApplicant asserts that she is an honest person and a loyal U.S. citizen, who \nwould never do anything to harm the interests of the U.S. She stated she is doing her \nbest to raise three children on her own. She provided three character reference letters. \nAll three authors spoke of Applicant\u2019s good character, work ethic, and trustworthiness. \nShe also provided a copy of her Performance Management and Individual Growth Plan \n(position description).9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n \n7 Items 9, 8, 7, and 6, respectively. \n \n8 Item 4. \n \n9 Item 3. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d10 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).11 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n10  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n11  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is addressed by Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her SF 85P, her credit reports, \nher answers to DOHA interrogatories, and her SOR response.  \n \nApplicant provided no persuasive evidence that she has paid, settled or \notherwise resolved the 12 debts totaling $30,964 alleged. Her debts have been ongoing \nas demonstrated by her credit reports. For example, her $9,354 student loan became \npast due in 1992. The 12 debts alleged in her SOR are substantiated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and/or evidence presented. The Government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,12 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to raise the \napplicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant has not dealt responsibly with her financial obligations before, or \nespecially after receipt of the SOR. Based on her security clearance application, \nApplicant has continuously worked for her current employer since July 2007. She \npresented little or no evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented \nnegotiations, payment plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. It is unclear \nwhen her last payments were made on any of these 12 delinquent debts. Considering \nthe record as a whole, I conclude these12 debts, totaling about $30,964.00 are still \nvalid, delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible for them.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nshe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken \ncontrol of her financial situation. Based on the available evidence, her financial \nproblems are recent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. She has \nnot carried her burden of showing that any of the Guideline F mitigating conditions \napply. Her overall financial behavior casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n12  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment for a government contractor weighs in her \nfavor. She has had access to sensitive information since at least July 2007. There is no \nevidence of any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-\ncriminal issue), she is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility and \nmitigation. She is well regarded by her superiors and co-workers. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. She has \na significant history of delinquent debt that goes back to at least 1992. Applicant has \nhad access to sensitive information since July 2007. As such, she was or should have \nbeen well aware of her financial responsibilities, and that her failure to be financially \nresponsible would raise security clearance concerns.  \n \nIn fairness to the Applicant, this decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that she cannot or will not attain the state of financial stability necessary \nto justify the award of a DoD security clearance. Should Applicant be afforded an \nopportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, she may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security worthiness. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude she has not mitigated the public trust concerns pertaining to financial \nconsiderations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 29, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on November 27, 2006.  On April 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on May 13, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on July 16, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 16, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for July 24, 2008, at the Applicant\u2019s request.  The Applicant\nknowingly waived the 15 days notice required by the Directive in order to expedite the\nmatter.  At the hearing the Government presented four exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 4.  The Applicant presented five exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, and he testified on his own behalf.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on July 31, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Taiwan.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 15).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 51 years of age and has a Masters Degree\nand a Ph.D. in Optical Sciences.  He is employed as a Senior Principal Systems\nEngineer for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1957, and grew up there.  He also obtained\nhis undergraduate degree from a university in Taiwan.  He first came to the United\nStates in 1982, on a graduate student visa to attend college.  After several months, his\nfather fell ill, and he returned to Taiwan to be with his family.  In 1983, the Applicant\nreturned to the United States to pursue his studies and in 1988, he was awarded a\nMasters and Ph.D. in Optical Sciences.  In 1983, the Applicant married a Taiwanese\nwoman he met in the United States.  In December 1991, he began working for a\ndefense contractor.  In May 1996, he became a naturalized United States citizen.  That\nsame year, he applied for and was granted a security clearance.  He later applied for a\nSpecial Compartmentalized Access, but was denied access in June 2004.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  His\nmother is a 79 year old housewife.  His father, who was born in China, is 89 years old.\nHe served as a General in the Taiwanese Air Force until he retired in the mid 80's.  He\nflew fighter aircraft in World War II against the Japanese.  The Applicant testified that\nhis father is financially supported by a retirement pension plan, but the Applicant does\nnot know if it is provided for by the Government of Taiwan.  His father had a seizure in\nJanuary, and is currently very ill. \nThe Applicant has close emotional ties to his parents in Taiwan.  He calls them\non a weekly basis to, among other things, keep up with their health concerns.  (Tr. p.\n54).  On occasion he sends gifts and money when they are in need.  (Tr. pp. 52-53).  He\ntestified that he will help them in the future if necessary.  He visits them in Taiwan on a\nyearly basis and stays with them during his visits.  He traveled to Taiwan in 1999, 2000,\n\n3\n2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2008.  On occasion, his wife and son travel to\nTaiwan with him.  He plans to spend his yearly vacations in Taiwan to visit his family\nthere.       \nThe Applicant\u2019s only financial assets are in the United States.  They are valued at\napproximately $400,000.00, which includes a house, a couple of certified savings\naccounts, and a 401(k).  \nLetters from the Applicant\u2019s Supervisor, a Senior Manager, the Senior Program\nManager, two Directors of programs and other professional colleagues and coworkers\nattest to the Applicant\u2019s high performance level and serious and professional approach\nto his work efforts.  He is considered to be a person of honesty, integrity, dedication and\ncompetence.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nThe Applicant has received numerous awards for his contributions to the\ncompany.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  Performance appraisals for his entire period of\nemployment beginning in 1992, through the 2007, reflect consistent ratings of\nsatisfactory or above in every category.  (See Applicant\u2019 Exhibit C).\nA copy of the Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s Aviation Training yearbook from his time in the\nTaiwanese military was placed into evidence.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Taiwan.  Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one of the most\nactive collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.  Numerous\nindividuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or prosecuted for\nillegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United States technology to\nTaiwan.  One United States official was recently convicted of crimes relating to his\nimproper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\n\n4\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence ad has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies. None of\nthe mitigating conditions are applicable.\n\n6\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant\u2019s has close emotional attachments to his\nparents in Taiwan. He telephones them once a week, travels to see them annually, and\nsends them gifts and/or money if they need it.  He is devoted to his parents and he is\nobviously a good son.  This close bond or strong evidence of affection, however, could\npotentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Furthermore, as a retired General in the\nTaiwanese Air Force, it can be presumed that the Applicant\u2019s father receives a\nsignificant pension from the Government of Taiwan.  It is also noted that the current\npolitical situation in Taiwan elevates the cause for concern in this case.  Based upon\nthis evidence, the possibility of foreign influence exists that could create the potential for\nconduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  Under the particular facts\nof this case, I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I\nfind against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Jonathan Bell, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 16, 2007. On \nMay 11, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified him that it \nwas unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \naccess to classified information, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an \nadministrative judge for a determination whether to grant or deny his application. DOHA \nset forth the basis for its action in a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and E. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n11/14/2012\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 21, 2012; answered it on May 24, 2012; \nsupplemented his answer on July 25, 2012; and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 1, 2012, \nand the case was assigned to me on September 7, 2012. The hearing was tentatively \nscheduled for the week of October 9-12, 2012, but it was postponed because of \nApplicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s scheduling conflicts. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October \n1, 2012, scheduling it to be conducted by video teleconference on October 22, 2012. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and requested that the record \nbe kept open to enable him to present two documents in addition to the documents \nappended to his answer to the SOR. I kept the record open until October 24, 2012, and \nhe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 1, 2012. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Bangladesh. The request and the documents attached as enclosures to the \nrequest are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant did not object, and I \ngranted Department Counsel\u2019s request. Applicant also requested that I take \nadministrative notice of the facts recited in a U.S. Government document attached to his \nanswer to the SOR, and I granted his request. (Tr. 13-14.) The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b and \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a, and 2.b. His admissions in his \nanswer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since \nMay 2001. He has held a security clearance since April 2003. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Bangladesh. He completed college in June 1975, with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in commerce. After graduating, he lived about 300 miles away from \nhis family. He worked as a receptionist at the front desk of a hotel, was promoted to \nnight auditor after three years, and then was made a supervisor. He worked at the hotel \nuntil early 1985, when he decided to move to the United States in search of a better life. \n(Tr. 23-24.) He flew to Mexico with a tour group and then traveled by ship to the United \nStates, where he entered legally as a tourist, but without disclosing his intention to \nremain permanently in the United States. He contacted his brother, who already resided \nin the United States, and worked \u201coff the books\u201d at various jobs. In June 1985, he \nmoved to a farm that hired illegal aliens and worked as a clerk and bookkeeper. He \nreturned to his brother\u2019s home in October 1985 and worked in a grocery store and as a \nlaborer. He obtained a work permit in November 1988, pursuant to an amnesty program \nfor illegal aliens. He began working at various security officer positions in June 1988. He \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbecame a U.S. citizen in August 1996. He began his current job in May 2001. (GX 2 at \n1-6.) \n \n \nApplicant married in October 1991. His wife, a native of Bangladesh, came to the \nUnited States in 1995 and became a U.S. citizen in 2002. Their 16-year-old son is a \nnative-born U.S. citizen. (GX 1 at 14-18; Supplemental Answer to SOR at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant took no sick leave or vacation time from 2005 to 2011, because he was \nsaving his money to buy a home. He bought a home for $170,000 in December 2011. \n(Tr. 38-39.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His father passed away in 1985. (Tr. 24.) His \nmother became seriously ill in 2003 and passed away in April 2009.  \n \n \nApplicant has four brothers and four sisters. He is the oldest of the male siblings, \nand older than three of his four sisters. The SOR alleges foreign influence concerns \nraised by the citizenship and location of his siblings. The table below summarizes the \ninformation about Applicant\u2019s siblings. \n \nSibling \nCitizenship/ \nResidence \nOccupation\nSpouse \nOccupation \nFrequency  \nof Contact \nEvidence \nBrother #1 United  \nStates \nCab Driver \nHousewife \n(U.S. citizen)\nMonthly by \ntelephone; in \nperson every 2-\n3 months \nGX 3 at 12-\n13; Answer \nBrother #2 Bangladesh \nBank clerk \n \nHousewife \nMonthly; sends \nannual gift \nGX 3 at 14; \nAnswer \nBrother #3 Bangladesh \nHotel \nmarketing \nHousewife \nNone since April \n2009 \nGX 3 at 26 \nBrother #4 Bangladesh \nFood/drink \ndistributor \nBank officer \nNone since April \n2009 \nGX 3 at 27 \nSister #1 \nUnited \nKingdom \nHousewife \nRestaurant \nOwner \n(U.K. citizen)\nMonthly \nGX 3 at 14-\n15 \nSister #2 \nBangladesh \nHousewife \nRetired \nteacher \nNone since April \n2009 \nGX 3 at 25 \nSister #3 \nBangladesh \nHousewife \nPolice \ninspector \nNone since April \n2009 \nGX 3 at 26 \nSister #4 \nBangladesh \nHousewife \nBank officer \nNone since April \n2009 \nGX 3 at 26 \n \n \nBrother #1 came to the United States in early 1985, before Applicant\u2019s arrival, \nand Applicant lived with him for about 20 years. This brother became a U.S. citizen in \nSeptember 2009. (GX 3 at 12-13; Supplemental Answer to SOR at 12-13.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nBrother #2 manages the family agricultural property and works as a clerk in a \nbank that provides loans to farmers. In a sworn statement in November 2009, Applicant \nstated that his brother was employed by a government-owned bank, but in his \nsupplemental answer to the SOR he denied that the bank is owned by the government. \nAt the hearing, he testified he \u201cdoesn\u2019t think\u201d the bank is owned by the government. \nApplicant has telephone contact with Brother #2 about once a month and personal \ncontact every three or four months. He sends Brother #2 an annual gift of about $300. \n(GX 3 at 14; Supplemental Answer to SOR at 10; Tr. 52, 63-64.) \n \n \nApplicant speaks to Sister #1 about once a month. (GX 3 at 14-15.) He had no \ncontact with Brother #3, Brother #4, or his other sisters until his mother\u2019s death in 2009. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s mother died, his wife telephoned each of his siblings and suggested \nthat he \u201csay something.\u201d He briefly spoke to each sibling, asking them to pray for their \nmother. He has had no contact with Brother #3, Brother #4, or his three sisters in \nBangladesh since April 2009. (GX 3 at 25-26; Tr. 66-68, 85-86.) \n  \nApplicant traveled to Bangladesh to visit his wife annually in 1991 through 1994, \nbut he had no contact with any of his siblings during these visits. He visited his ailing \nmother and Brother #2 in Bangladesh in 2003 but had no contact with his other siblings. \n(Tr. 42-43.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in April 2001, as part \nof his in-processing for his current job. He had no previous experience with employment \nby a federal contractor or with the security clearance process. In Section 9, asking him \nto list his relatives and associates, he listed his parents, Brother #1, an extended family \nmember who lived with Brother #1, Brother #2, and Sister #1. He listed the full address \nfor Brother #1 and Sister #1, but he listed only a post office for his Brother #2. He \nomitted the other siblings who live in Bangladesh. (GX 2.) He testified that he omitted \nfive of his siblings because he had only about two hours to complete all his paperwork, \nincluding the SCA, did not know the whereabouts or dates of birth of his siblings, and \ndid not understand the importance of listing all his siblings. At the time he completed \nthis SCA, he had no contact with the five siblings he omitted. (Tr. 32-34.) He testified \nthat he did not simply list their names, without the other information required on the \nform, because he thought that incomplete information \u201cwould be a problem.\u201d (Tr. 82.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he had some information about his family members in a \nnotebook that he carried in his back pocket, such as his mother\u2019s maiden name, his \nnaturalization certificate number, and his sister\u2019s telephone number in the United \nKingdom. He attempted to call Brother #1 to obtain additional information, but could not \nreach him. He was able to call his wife and obtain her personal information. (Tr. 74-79.)  \n \n \nApplicant completed another SCA in July 2007, seeking to continue his \nclearance. In Section 15, asking him to his relatives and associates, he listed his \nparents and the same three siblings that he listed on his previous SCA. He did not list \nhis other siblings who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. (GX 1.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in November 2007, and he \nverified the information regarding the family members that he listed on his July 2007 \nSCA. He was not asked if he had any family members other than those he listed on his \nSCA. (Tr. 48.)  \n \nApplicant was interviewed again in November 2009. He testified that the \ninterview was triggered because his background investigation revealed a second home \naddress and a second job in his name. He told the investigator that he noticed several \nsuspicious entries on his credit report, challenged them with the credit reporting \nagencies, and reported the apparent identity theft to the police. This investigator also \nverified the information Applicant had provided regarding the siblings listed on his July \n2007 SCA. Applicant realized after the detailed questioning in November 2009 about his \nchildhood and family history that he should have listed all his siblings on his SCA. When \nhe mentioned his concern about the omitted information to his wife, she suggested that \nBrother #1 might be able to provide the information. (GX 2 at 24-25; AX B; Tr. 48-51, \n89.) \n \n \nOn the following day, Applicant contacted the security investigator and informed \nhim that he wanted to add the information about his other siblings to his investigative \nfile. He provided information about all eight siblings in a sworn statement dated \nNovember 20, 2009. (Tr. 51; GX 3 at 25-28.) \n \n \nIn November 2011, DOHA asked Applicant to verify that the summary of his \nNovember 2007 interview was accurate. He verified that the summary accurately \ndescribed the interview, but he added the information about the siblings who were not \ndiscussed during that interview. (GX 4 at 3-12.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s duties since May 2001 have included protection of senior officials of \nthe United States and foreign countries. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001, he distinguished himself by voluntarily remaining at his duty station for 24 hours \nto protect senior officials and U.S. property. He distinguished himself again in 2003 \nduring a significant diplomatic event, and during an emergency evacuation of a \ngovernment building in 2007. He was appointed as a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal in \n2007. He has received numerous certificates of appreciation and accolades from \nofficials ranging from his immediate superiors to senior government officials. He enjoys \na reputation for honesty, integrity, and devotion to duty. (Enclosures to Supplemental \nAnswer to SOR.)   \n \n \nBangladesh is a parliamentary democracy. The president is the chief of state, but \nthe post is primarily ceremonial, with the real executive power held by the prime \nminister, who is elected by the legislature every five years. The legislature is a 300-seat \nunicameral body, elected by universal suffrage every five years. The judiciary is a civil \ncourt system based on the British model. \n \n \nBangladesh is one of the world\u2019s poorest and most densely populated countries. \nIts economy is primarily agricultural. The United States is Bangladesh\u2019s third-largest \n\n \n6 \n \n \nexport market. Despite the country\u2019s dysfunctional political system, weak governance, \nand pervasive corruption, Bangladesh has begun competing in the global clothing \nmarket, exporting significant amounts of garments and knitwear to the United States. \n \n \nBangladesh pursues a moderate foreign policy that relies heavily on multinational \ndiplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In recent years, it has played a significant \nrole in international peacekeeping activities.  \n \n \nThe United States\u2019 relationship with Bangladesh initially was troubled because of \nstrong U.S. ties to Pakistan, but it developed quickly after Bangladesh gained its \nindependence from Pakistan in 1971. U.S.-Bangladesh relations now are excellent. In \nMay 2012, the United States and Bangladesh signed a partnership agreement, affirming \ntheir strong bonds of friendship and shared values. The two countries pledged to \ndevelop deeper and broader people-to-people ties and to further support the exchange \nof information, skills, and technology. \n \n \nBangladesh has experienced significant human rights problems involving killings \nand torture by security forces, societal violence, government discrimination, and life-\nthreatening prison conditions. Members of the security forces often act with impunity. \nCorruption within security forces and the judiciary is a serious problem. Terrorist and \nextremist groups have targeted the United States and the United Kingdom as \u201cenemies \nof Islam.\u201d Nevertheless, the government has conducted numerous arrests and seizures \nas part of its commitment to counterterrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n7 \n \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has one brother who is a citizen of Bangladesh \nand resides in the United States (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and three brothers and three sisters who \nare citizens and residents of Bangladesh (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It also alleges that one of his \nbrothers is employed by a bank owned by the Bangladesh government (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \nand one of his sisters is a police inspector in Bangladesh (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \n\n \n8 \n \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n AG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of \nthe government, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nWhen an applicant\u2019s family ties are at issue, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR \nCase No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). Applicant has isolated himself from \nhis siblings and their families in Bangladesh, except for Brother #2. Nevertheless, his \nfamily ties in Bangladesh are numerous. Brother #2 has a possible government \nconnection at the bank where he works, and Sister #4 is married to a senior police \nofficial. In addition, there is some likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family members could be \ntargeted by radical terrorist groups because of their connection to \u201cenemies of Islam.\u201d \nThese factors are sufficient to raise the \u201cheightened risk\u201d required under AG \u00b6 7(a) and \nthe possibility of a conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nThree mitigating conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.   \n \n \nBangladesh is a friendly country with a moderate foreign policy and a strong \ncommitment to counterterrorism. It has an agricultural and light manufacturing economy \nthat is not dependent on sensitive technological information, and there is no evidence \nthat it targets the United States for economic or military intelligence. Nevertheless, the \ninstability of the Middle East and the activities of anti-U.S. terrorist groups in \nBangladesh preclude a finding that a possible conflict of interest is unlikely. Thus, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant has deep and longstanding ties to the United \nStates. He has resided in the United States for 27 years, has been a citizen for 16 \nyears, and has held a security clearance for 11 years. He is married to a U.S. citizen, \nhis son is a native-born U.S. citizen, Brother #1 is a U.S. citizen, and the spouse of \nBrother #1 is a U.S. citizen. Applicant has demonstrated his dedication to duty on \nnumerous occasions. He has occasional contact with Brother #2, but no contact with his \n\n \n10 \n \n \nother siblings or their families in Bangladesh. I am satisfied that Applicant would resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is established. \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family \nmember in a foreign country are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 1, 2002). I am not satisfied that Applicant\u2019s contacts with Brother #2 are \u201cminimal,\u201d \nand he has not rebutted the presumption that those infrequent contacts are not casual. \nHowever, Applicant has had no contact with his other siblings in Bangladesh since April \n2009. I conclude that AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established for Brother #2, but it is established for \nApplicant\u2019s other siblings in Bangladesh. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified a security clearance application in July \n2007 by omitting two brothers and three sisters in response to question 15, asking him \nto list his relatives and associates (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleges that he falsified an SCA in \nApril 2001 by omitting two brothers and four sisters (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to list some of his siblings on his 2001 SCA and \nagain on his 2007 SCA. His explanation that he believed that providing partial \ninformation would be \u201ca problem\u201d is plausible and credible, but it does not refute his \nadmissions that he deliberately omitted the information on both SCAs. He weighed the \noption of providing incomplete information about his siblings against the option of \nproviding an incomplete listing of his siblings, and chose the second option, not fully \n\n \n11 \n \n \nunderstanding the importance of the omitted information. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nraised. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 17(a). He did not correct his \nomissions promptly after submitting his SCAs in 2001 and 2007, but he contacted the \ninvestigator shortly after his interview in 2009, and he volunteered the information about \nhis siblings without being confronted with any evidence that his SCAs were incomplete. \n \n \nApplicant also receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 17(c). His intentional omissions \nwere not \u201cminor.\u201d The fact that he provided incomplete information on two successive \nSCAs and the initial November 2009 interview militates against a conclusion that his \nconduct was \u201cinfrequent.\u201d However, it has been more than three years since he supplied \nfull information about his siblings, he has continued to perform his duties with dedication \nand integrity, and he continues to enjoy the support of his supervisors. His \nmisunderstanding of the importance of the information about his siblings, his remorse \nabout his omissions, and his recognition of the importance of full disclosure make \nfurther intentional omissions of material information unlikely to recur. His supervisors \nhave no doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nFinally, Applicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 17(d). He has acknowledged \nhis behavior and expressed remorse for it. He did not intend to be deceptive, and none \nof the omitted information was derogatory. The factor that caused his conduct, i.e., his \nmisunderstanding of the importance of the omitted information, has been overcome. I \nam satisfied that his behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n12 \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guideline(s), but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. His explanation for \nomitting information about his siblings was plausible, and his remorse was genuine. He \nhas continued to perform his duties with distinction even though it has been more than \nfive years since he submitted his SCA and almost three years since he provided \ndetailed information about all his siblings. He has held a clearance for 11 years, \napparently without incident. He has been isolated from his family members in \nBangladesh since he graduated from college in 1975, and that isolation was intensified \nwhen he came to the United States in 1985. His strong ties to the United States leave \nme with no doubt that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and \nE, evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my duty \nto resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns based on his foreign family ties and his personal conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Another officer then followed her in a police car and\nsignaled for her to pull over.  She did not immediately comply.

In checking\n2\nApplicant\u2019s information in the police database, the officer who stopped Applicant learned that an arrest warrant had been\nissued for Applicant . . .  The warrant had been issued because in January 2006 she had hit an automobile dealer\u2019s\nemployee with her automobile and left the premises.\u201d  Id. at 2-3.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 20, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 18, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings are supported\nby substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in failing to mitigate the security concerns\nraised in Applicant\u2019s case; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has been arrested twice.\nThe first incident occurred in 1995, when she was charged with assaulting a police officer.   The case\n1\nwas dismissed before trial as a nolle prosequi.  The second incident occurred in 2006.  Applicant was\narrested for reckless endangerment, first degree assault, second degree assault, and theft of property\nvalued at less than $500.   She pled guilty to second degree assault and to theft.  The court imposed\n2\nprobation before judgement, her probation period being three years.  Applicant has numerous\ndelinquent debts, beginning in 2001.  Her security clearance application listed 23 \u201cemployment\nactivities\u201d between 1994 and 2007.  Decision at 3.  Concerning the Guideline F security concerns,\nthe Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cemployment history shows short-term employment and periods\nof unemployment.  It was not clear from the record that Applicant\u2019s apparent inability to hold long-\nterm employment was the result of a condition beyond her control.  She admitted that the\ndelinquencies alleged on the SOR remained unresolved, resulting in substantial debt which continues\nto the present day, a situation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment.\u201d  Id. at 7. As\nregards Guideline J, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s conduct caused or threatened to cause harm\nto others, yet she did not express remorse. \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that she\nhad committed the offenses listed under Guideline J.  She states that the fact that the cases were\nresolved without formal convictions means that she did not commit the alleged misconduct.\n\nHowever, \u201cthe fact that criminal charges were dropped, dismissed, or resulted in an acquittal does\nnot preclude an Administrative Judge from finding an applicant engaged in the conduct underlying\nthose criminal charges.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0119 at 2 (App. Bd.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nDecember 18, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn October 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November \n10, 2008. On November 10, 2008, Applicant and Department Counsel agreed on a \nhearing date of December 1, 2008, and a notice of hearing was issued on November \n13, 2008.  Applicant received the notice of hearing on November 18, 2008. I convened a \nhearing on December 1, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses and introduced seven exhibits, which were marked Ex. \n1 through 7 and admitted to the record without objections.  Applicant testified on her \nown behalf and called no witnesses. She introduced six exhibits, which were marked \nEx. A through F and admitted to the record without objections. \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of \nbusiness December 8, 2008, so that Applicant could, if she wished, provide additional \ninformation for the record. Applicant provided six additional exhibits, which were marked \nEx. G through L and admitted to the record without objections. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on December 8, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 24 allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.x) and two allegations of disqualifying \nconduct under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct (\u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b).  In her Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted 11 of the Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, \n1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.t, and 1.v) and denied 13 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.l, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, \n1.u, 1.w, 1.x). She admitted one Guideline J allegation (\u00b6 2.b) and denied the other (\u00b6 \n2.a). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and a college graduate. She was married in 1999 and \ndivorced in 2005. She has custody of her two children, ages 18 and 11. She receives \napproximately $482 a month in child support.  (Tr. 17, 54, 104-105.) \n \n \nIn March 1995, Applicant was driving in traffic. A police officer, who was directing \ntraffic, gave her hand signals indicating where she should drive. She ignored the \nofficer\u2019s instructions. Another officer then followed her in a police car and signaled for \nher to pull over. She did not immediately comply.  When she finally stopped, an officer \ncame to her vehicle and banged on the window and signaled her to get out of her car.  \nWhen she came out of her car, she cursed the officer. Applicant was arrested, taken \ninto custody, and charged with Assault Police Officer. The charge was later nolle \nprosequi.  Applicant pleaded guilty to driving in a bus lane.  (Tr. 55-61; Ex. 5 at 3.)  \n \n \nIn about February 2006, Applicant was pulled over by police because her license \nplate was not properly attached to her car. In checking Applicant\u2019s information in the \npolice database, the officer who stopped Applicant learned that an arrest warrant had \nbeen issued for Applicant. The warrant specified four counts: Reckless Endangerment, \nAssault - First Degree, Assault - Second Degree, and Theft: Less $500 Value.  The \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwarrant had been issued because in January 2006 she had hit an automobile dealer\u2019s \nemployee with her automobile and left the premises. Applicant was tried. She pleaded \nguilty to Assault - Second Degree and Theft: Less $500 Value. Judgment was Stayed, \nand in September 2006, Applicant was awarded three years probation and ordered to \npay court costs.  The other two counts were nolle prosequi. (Tr. 64-68; Ex. 4, 6-7; Ex. \n5.) \n \n \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant listed 23 employment activities between 1994 and \nJanuary 2007. In 2001, she was granted an interim security clearance. Applicant \nreported the following recent employment pattern:  In January 2007, she was employed \nas a Desktop Technician by a government contractor. She left that job in April 2007 and \nwas unemployed until July 2007. From July 1 to September 1, 2007, she was employed. \nShe had additional temporary employment from about August 22 to September 5, 2007. \nShe was then unemployed until November 1, 2007.  From November 2007 until June \n30, 2008, Applicant was employed.  At her hearing on December 1, 2008, she reported \nthat she had been unemployed and unable to find work since July 2008.  (Ex. 1, 15-36; \nTr. 45, 47-51, 53, 104.) \n \n \nApplicant reported that her financial problems began in 2001. At her security \nclearance hearing, she discussed debts she denied in her answer to the SOR. She \nadmitted she owed a delinquent debt, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a, which had been placed for \ncollection in about May 2001 and which had not been satisfied as of March 14, 2008. \nShe acknowledged that the delinquency was for credit card debt. The SOR alleged she \nowed the creditor $2,077. While she acknowledged the debt, Applicant disputed the \namount and stated she thought it was \u201c1500 something.\u201d Applicant stated she had not \npaid the debt but was disputing it and requesting a settlement. The debt was shown on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of March 14, 2008, with the notation that \u201cconsumer disputes \nthis account information.\u201d (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 3; Tr. 39, 73-75.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.n that Applicant owed two delinquent debts for \nparking tickets. In her answer to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant denied owing a parking ticket of \n$250 that had been placed for collection in 2001 and that had not been satisfied as of \nFebruary 6, 2007. In her answer to SOR \u00b6 1.n, she admitted owing a parking ticket debt \nof $150 that had been placed for collection in July 2005. At her hearing, Applicant \nadmitted both debts and stated she was willing to pay them at some future time.  (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR; Tr. 75-76.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.c that Applicant owed a creditor a debt of $1,542, which \nhad been charged off in September 2001 and had not been satisfied as of February 6, \n2007. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt.  At her hearing, Applicant \nstated the creditor had made her an offer of settlement, but she sought clarification of \nthe account number. She acknowledged that the debt remained unsatisfied.  (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR; Tr. 77-78.)   \n \n \nIn her answer to SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant admitted a debt of $342 which had been \nplaced for collection in December 2001. At her hearing, she stated she had informed the \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncreditor of her current financial situation.  She acknowledged that the debt had not been \nsatisfied.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Tr. 78-79.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.e that Applicant owed a debt of approximately $1,087 to \na creditor on an account that had been charged off in March 2003.  In her answer, \nApplicant denied the debt.  At her hearing, Applicant stated the debt had been paid and \nprovided documentation that purported to show the debt had been satisfied.  Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentation was an offer, dated September 18, 2008, from a successor creditor \noffering to settle the debt for $185. In a post-hearing submission, she provided \ndocumentation to corroborate her assertion that she had settled the debt.  (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR; Tr. 79-80; Ex. C; Ex. G.)    \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f that Applicant owed a creditor about $8,584 on a \njudgment entered against her in April 2003.  The SOR also alleged that, as of June \n2008, Applicant\u2019s wages had been garnished to satisfy the judgment.  Applicant \nadmitted the debt and stated that her wages had been garnished to satisfy the debt. \nThe last time her wages were garnished to satisfy the debt was in June 2008.  She still \nowes the creditor about $6,000 on the debt.  (Tr. 80-81; Ex. 4 at 13.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.g a collection account debt of $2,219 to a landlord. At \u00b6 \n1.k, the SOR alleges a judgment of $1,710 entered against Applicant by the same \nlandlord. In his answer, Applicant denied the allegation at \u00b6 1.g and admitted the \njudgment at \u00b6 1.k. She stated that \u00b6 1.g duplicated \u00b6 1.k.  She stated she had tried to \nresolve the debt, which represented rent arrearages from 2002 and 2003. The debt has \nnot been satisfied, and Applicant failed to provide documentation to support her \nassertion that \u00b6 1.g duplicated \u00b6 1.k.  As a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided \na document showing that on December 9, 2008, she agreed to pay the judgment \ncreditor $20 a month, beginning in January 2009.   (Tr. 81-83; Ex. 3 at 2; Ex. L, 2, 4.) \n \n \n In response to the SOR allegation at \u00b6 1.h, Applicant admitted a debt of $3,075 \non a judgment entered against her in March 2004. Applicant contacted the judgment \ncreditor and requested a settlement. The creditor refused to settle the debt, which has \nnot been paid. (Tr. 83.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.t.  She \nidentified them as medical debts which had not been paid.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Tr. \n84-87.) \n \n \nApplicant denied a debt of $103 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i.  At her security clearance \nhearing she explained she owed the debt, which she said she had paid in part. Her last \npayment on the debt was in early 2007. She estimated that she still owed $91 on the \ndebt.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted a debt to a creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.l.  The SOR \nidentified the amount of the debt as $1,182 and alleged the account had been \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndelinquent since 2004.  Applicant disputed the amount of the debt, which she has not \npaid.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Tr. 88-90.) \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied an $18,762 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.q.  At her hearing, she stated the debt was incurred when she purchased a new \nautomobile in February 2005. She claimed the automobile was defective and requested \nthat the defective automobile be replaced. In post-hearing submissions, she provided \ndocumentation to corroborate her negotiations with the automobile dealer.  Her last \npayment on the automobile was in October 2005.  She retained the automobile until \nmid-2007.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Tr. 90-96; Ex. I.) \n \n \nIn her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, \n1.w. and 1.x.  At her hearing, she admitted the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.s. and \nstated that they had not been paid. She stated she had paid the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.u \nand reported that the creditor had no record of receiving her payment. She denied \nknowledge of a $366 debt alleged at \u00b6 1.w.  The debt was listed on her credit report of \nFebruary 6, 2007, and she failed to provide documentation to corroborate that the debt \ndid not belong to her. She admitted the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.x, and she acknowledged \nthat it had not been paid. In her answer to the SOR, she also admitted the debt alleged \nat \u00b6 1.v (SOR; Answer to SOR; Tr. 87-88, 96-98; Ex. 2 at 14.) \n \n \nAt the time of her hearing, Applicant was unemployed and had no income. She \nwas not collecting unemployment insurance. Her monthly rent was $1,560.  She had not \npaid her rent since April 2008 and was being evicted from her apartment.  She stated \nthat she relied on her parents and siblings to provide her with money to meet her \nimmediate needs.  (Tr. 53-54,104, 106-107.) \n    \n  \n \n  In 2008, Applicant purchased a 2006 automobile for $23,000.  Her initial down \npayment on the vehicle was $500.  Her monthly payments were $568.  She has not \nbeen able to make her car payments since October 2008. She has been offered a \nhardship deferment on her car payments. She has not been able to make a payment on \nher existing credit card debt since June 2008.  She has zero balances in her checking \nand savings accounts.  She received credit counseling in 2006.  (Tr. 100-104.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n7 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.e had been satisfied. The record supports a conclusion that SOR \u00b6 1.g duplicates \nSOR \u00b6 1.k.  Accordingly, I conclude SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g. for Applicant. \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from  \n2001 to the present time. Her employment history shows short-term employment and \nperiods of unemployment. It was not clear from the record that Applicant\u2019s apparent \ninability to hold long-term employment was the result of a condition beyond her control.  \nShe admitted that the delinquencies alleged on the SOR remained unresolved, resulting \nin substantial debt which continues to the present day, a situation which raises concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s good judgment. \n \nAt the time of her hearing, Applicant had no income and was unable to pay her \nrent.  She had recently purchased an automobile but had no income with which to make \nmonthly payments on the automobile debt. She was unable to make monthly payments \non her credit card debt.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant had received financial counseling. While she admitted responsibility for \nher debts, it was not clear that she understood her financial problems or how to resolve \nthem. She had no plan in place to systematically resolve her substantial delinquent debt \nand prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part in \nmitigation, but that AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG 20(e) do not apply in \nmitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \nAppellant admitted criminal offenses in 1995 and 2006 for which she was \narrested and charged. She is currently on probation for offenses she was charged with \nin 2006. Her probation runs until September 2009. This conduct raises concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(c), and 31(d).1 \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to the Appellant\u2019s case.  \nIf \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record demonstrates that Appellant\u2019s criminal behavior occurred in 1995 and \n2006. Her criminal conduct, Assault Police Officer, occurred in 1995 and is not recent. \nHowever, her 2006 criminal conduct, Assault Second Degree and Theft: Less $500 \nValue, is recent and she will serve the probation awarded for those offenses until \nSeptember 2009. While Appellant acknowledged her arrests for criminal conduct, she \ndid not express remorse or regret for her conduct, which threatened or caused bodily \nharm to other human beings. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct continues to cast doubt on \nher reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 \n32 (d) do not apply to the facts of her case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n \n1 AG \u00b6 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \u201callegation or \nadmission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d) reads: \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nseveral years ago and continue to the present. She has not taken affirmative action to \npay or resolve her delinquent debts.  Her many delinquencies and her lack of attention \nto them continue to raise security concerns. At a time when she lacked sufficient \nfinancial resources to meet her basic living needs, she purchased a vehicle she could \nnot afford. She failed to budget her income to satisfy her debts.  Instead, she continued \non a pattern of financial overextension, which, in the past, led to bad debts, judgments, \nand vehicle repossessions. Applicant\u2019s lack of awareness of remedies for her financial \noverextension suggests the pattern may continue into the future. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred when she was a mature adult.  \nBy her actions in 1995 and 2006, she threatened or brought about bodily harm to \nothers. She expressed no remorse for this conduct, raising serious questions about her \nstability, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies and criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: Against Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h through 1.x:   Against Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III \nposition is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 11, 2007, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF \n85P).1 On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny Applicant eligibility for a public trust position, citing trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \n \n1  FORM Item 4. \n \nSeptember 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn March 19, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 3, 2009, was provided to her by \nletter dated April 8, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA transmittal letter on \nApril 14, 2009. She was afforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She failed to submit any materials, \ncomments, or objections in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nJune 25, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s \nand 1.aa, which she denied. She also denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and b. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old defense contractor employee. She attended college \nfrom January through April 2002; however, it is not clear from the record the number of \ncredits she completed, or whether she received a degree. She separated from her \nspouse in May 2004, and they were divorced in August 2004. She has three sons. Her \noldest son is in college. It is not clear from the record whether they are all from this \nmarriage, what their ages are, how long they have been in Applicant\u2019s custody, or \nwhether they received financial assistance from their father.  \n \nApplicant worked for six different employers from July 1999 through August 2007 \n(Item 4). She was laid off in between jobs for approximately 30 days during 2006 and in \n2007. Applicant has been unemployed since August 2007. She left her last job under \nunfavorable circumstances, because she used her company credit card for gas without \nauthorization (Item 4, p. 3).  \n \nIn her public trust position application, Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d to question 19 \n(asking whether in the last seven years she had filed for bankruptcy, had been subject \nto a tax lien, or had a judgment rendered against her). She answered \u201cNo,\u201d to question \n20, asking whether she was currently over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligation. She failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d through 1.o, \nand 1.q. Her security clearance background investigation addressed her financial \nproblems, and included the review of her two answers to DOHA interrogatories (Items 5 \nand 6), excerpts of documents related to her 2004 bankruptcy petition (Item 8), and \n2007, 2008, and 2009 credit bureau reports (CBR) (Items 11, 10, and 9, respectively).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn her 2007 interview with a government investigator, consistent with her answers \nto the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the debts alleged in the SOR and provided \nexplanations about her financial problems. She explained that her financial problems \nwere created by her 2004 divorce. She was awarded minimal financial assistance \nthrough the court, receiving no alimony or maintenance and only $50 for child support.  \n \nFollowing her divorce, Applicant was overwhelmed by her debts. She was not \nearning enough money to pay both her day-to-day living expenses and her prior legal \nobligations. At the time, she had no budget or payment plan to pay her debts. In June \n2004, she filed for bankruptcy protection; however, she retracted her petition in August \n2004. Applicant explained that she was concerned about the adverse effects her filing \nfor bankruptcy would have on her future plans of opening her own business. She also \nfelt responsible to her creditors and wanted to make good on her obligations.  \n \nIn her 2007 statement, Applicant also claimed she was receiving financial \nassistance from a mortgage company employee who was helping her to review her \nfinancial options. This included a debt consolidation plan, negotiations with the creditors \nto settle some of the debts, and obtaining a second job to generate sufficient income to \npay for the possible debt consolidation plan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges 24 debts totaling approximately $29,700, all of which are \nestablished by the record evidence. Her debts include four unpaid judgments (two \ndating back to 2004, one from 2005, and one from 2007); an unpaid 2006 returned \ncheck, the unauthorized use of her company credit card in 2007, numerous delinquent \nmedical debts, unpaid utility bills, and two repossessed cars. In 2007, Applicant sought \nthe assistance of an attorney to help her file for bankruptcy protection. She intends to \nresolve her financial problems by filing for bankruptcy protection sometime in the near \nfuture. She provided no documentary evidence to show she has filed for bankruptcy.  \n \nApplicant presented no other documentary or corroborating evidence of any \nefforts taken to contact any of her creditors, to pay any of her debts, or to otherwise \nresolve any of her financial obligations. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant falsified question 20 of her 2007 SF 85P \n(asking whether she was currently over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligation), when she answer \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.d through 1.o, and 1.q. Applicant explained she mistakenly believed that the \nquestion was addressing only student loans. In her response to the SOR, she indicated \nthat \u201cthe choice was not intentional,\u201d and that she has always admitted and discussed \nher debts. She also averred she was honest in discussing her financial problems during \nher background interview.  \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose her delinquent debts. In reaching this \nconclusion, I considered Applicant\u2019s failed 2004 bankruptcy filing, her failure to present \nany evidence of efforts to pay or resolve any of her debts since then, the number of her \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndelinquent debts, the small value of many of the individual debts, the aggregate value of \nthe debt, and the period over which the debts have been delinquent.  \n \nApplicant is a single mother of three, living from paycheck to paycheck, while \ntrying to gain financial stability and keep her life on track. Notwithstanding her financial \nproblems, she has managed to help her older son through college and needs to \nmaintain her financial stability to help her children (Item 6). Her 2007 personal financial \nstatement shows that she has a negative remainder after paying all her bills each month \nwithout considering the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (Item 6). \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s controlling adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand common sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \n\n \n5 \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \n[or access to sensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the trustworthiness concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or \ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleges 24 delinquent/charged off accounts, including four judgments, a \nreturned check, and numerous medical and utility bills totaling approximately $29,700. \nAll of the delinquent debts are established by the record evidence. Except for her failed \n2004 bankruptcy filing, Applicant presented no evidence of efforts to pay or resolve the \nalleged financial obligations, many of which have been delinquent for many years. AG \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n \n19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to raise the full applicability of any \nmitigating condition. Her financial problems are ongoing and her evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely that they will recur. Her \nfinancial problems and her failure to fully address the trustworthiness concerns cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that could establish circumstances beyond her \ncontrol contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., her divorce, being a single \nmother of three, and her periods of unemployment. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only \npartially. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show how her 2004 divorce continues \nto impact her current financial situation and whether she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has been employed from 1999 to 2007, albeit with small \nperiods of unemployment between jobs and unemployed since 2007. Notwithstanding, \nshe presented little evidence of efforts to contact creditors to pay, settle, or to resolve \nher debts beyond her failed 2004 bankruptcy filing and her intention to file for \nbankruptcy protection in the future. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, there are no clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. Her inability to pay even \nsmall debts shows she was financially overextended, and that her financial problems \nare likely to recur. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the \nfacts in this case. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security/trustworthiness concern \nstating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on her public trust position \napplication when she failed to disclose that she was over 180 days delinquent on most \nof the financial obligations alleged in the SOR. In reaching this conclusion, I considered \nApplicant\u2019s failed 2004 bankruptcy filing, the lack of evidence of efforts to pay or resolve \nany of her debts since she acquired them, the number of her delinquent debts, the small \nvalue of many of the individual debts, the aggregate value of the debt, and the period \nover which the debts have been delinquent. Additionally, Applicant bounced a check, \nand used a company credit card for gas without authorization. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions create trustworthiness concerns under two disqualifying \nconditions. Her behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d and 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none are fully established \nby the sparse record evidence. Applicant falsified her SF 85P. It was not until after she \nwas confronted during the interview process that she admitted her delinquent debts. Her \nfalsification is a serious offense (felony), it is recent, and casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s financial problems led her to \nengage in questionable behavior. Her questionable behavior increased her vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance, \nor public trust position, must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, trained \nwoman, and a good mother. She has been successful working for numerous employers \nsince 1999. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that she is not a \ncompetent worker. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis. She presented little evidence of efforts to \nresolve her debts. There are no clear indications that her financial problem is being \nresolved or is under control. Her inability to pay even relatively small debts shows she is \nfinancially overextended. Based on the available evidence, she does not have the \nfinancial means to resolve her financial problems.  \n \nMoreover, she deliberately falsified her public trust position application when she \nfailed to disclose her full financial situation. Considering her 2004 bankruptcy filing, the \nnumber and aggregate value of debts and judgments, and the period over which the \ndebts have been delinquent, Applicant knew or should have known of her delinquent \ndebts and judgments at the time she completed her application. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems have led her to engage in illegal activities such as passing a bad check, \nabusing her employer\u2019s credit card privileges, and falsifying her SF 85P. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s financial behavior and personal \nconduct raise doubt about her ability to have access to sensitive information and her \ntrustworthiness. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.aa:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Duffy, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has 13 past due accounts totaling approximately $24,000. None of the \ndebts have been paid nor is there an arrangement to pay these debts. Applicant failed \nto mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \n \n1\n \nOn June 22, 2007, Applicant submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPosition (SF 85P). On August 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial problems as \nevicenced by delinquent debts, and Guideline E, personal conduct, for falsified material \non his SF 85P. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nMarch 10, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 19, 2008, Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was received. In his \nanswer, Applicant elected to have the matter decided without a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted the government's case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated \nDecember 29, 2008. The FORM contained 10 attachments. On January 6, 2009, \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM, along with notice of his opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n Responses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on February 5, 2009. As of February 26, 2009, no response had \nbeen received. On March 3, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied a $2,431 telephone company debt (\u00b6 \n1.b), the $767 debt (\u00b6 1.g), and the falsification listed in \u00b6 2.a. He admitted the \nremaining allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 21-year-old employee seeking to occupy a Public Trust Position in \nsupport of a contract with the Department of Defense. Neither Applicant\u2019s duty position \nnor the nature of the contract are known from the record as submitted. Applicant is \nseeking to obtain accesses to sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant owes 13 debts which total $23,911. There is no evidence of any \npayment on these debts. The majority of these accounts were opened in July and \nAugust 2006 when Applicant was working for a motel/hotel chain. In August 2006, \nApplicant returned to school and also obtained a job as an office assistant. (Item 5) \n \nThe debts in \u00b6 1.a, ($357) and \u00b6 1.b, ($2,431) are two telephone accounts \nopened in July 2006, which have been charged off. Applicant admits owing the first \ndebt, but not the second. In June 2008, in his response to written interrogatories (Item \n6), Applicant stated he had to look into the second debt because he was only aware of \nthe first debt. Both debts appear on Applicant\u2019s June 2007, February 2008, and August \n2008 credit bureau reports (CBR). (Items 7, 8, 9) In June 2008, when Applicant \nresponded to the written interrogatories (Item 6) he stated, with regard to the smaller \nphone bill, he \u201cshould be able to resolve this debt within the next few months.\u201d  \n \n \nThe debt in \u00b6 1.c ($887) was a credit card debt opened in June 2006. The CBR \nindicates the first payment on this debt was never received. (Item 9) The debt in \u00b6 1.d \n($321) was a chain store debt opened in July 2006. In response to the interrogatories, \nApplicant stated he had received a payoff agreement with the creditor and intended to \n\n \n \n \n3\npay the debt in full. The debt in \u00b6 1.e ($410) was a credit card debt opened in August \n2006.  \n \n \nThe debt in \u00b6 1.f ($9,757) was a credit union account opened in July 2006 for an \nautomobile. High credit was $12,840 with a 63 month repayment plan. The debt in \u00b6 1.g \n($767) was an account opened in August 2006 with terms of repayment of $37 per \nmonth. Applicant denies this debt because he does not recognize it. The debt in \u00b6 1.h \n($754) was a credit card account. In response to the interrogatories, Applicant stated he \nplanned to pay this debt.  \n \n \nThe debt in \u00b6 1.i ($717) was a bank debt which Applicant stated in June 2008 he \nplanned to pay by the end of the year. (Item 6) This is the only debt which does not \nappear in his CBRs. All the other debts listed in the SOR appear in all three of his \nCBRs.  \n \nThe debt in \u00b6 1.j ($1,750) was a student loan taken out in August 2006. High \ncredit was $3,500. As of the date of Applicant\u2019s June 2007 CBR, this debt was being \n\u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d (Item 9) The final two debts \u00b6 1.k ($2,821) and \u00b6 1.l ($2,939) were \nstudent loans taken out in October 2005. Repayment on the loans were $30 and $31 \nper month. (Item 9) In June 2008, when Applicant responded to the interrogatories, he \nstated he had received payment information three weeks prior and intended to start \nmaking payment on these loans.  \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant executed a SF 85P, which him asked in question 22.b if \nhe was currently more than 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the question. He did not explain why he answered no when he had the \npreviously listed delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross income is $1,608 per month and his take home pay is $1,296. \nHis rent is only $125 per month, his car expenses are $646, and his other expenses \ntotal $320. His monthly expenses total $1,091, which leaves $205 each month for all \nother expenses. Applicant has $652 of monthly debt repayment including insurance, \nphone service, and car payment. (Item 6) Applicant monthly disposable income (gross \nincome less deductions, expenses, and debt payment) is a negative $447. This amount \ndoes not include any amounts for student loan repayment or repayment on any of the \nother debts listed in the SOR.  \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . \n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \n\n \n \n \n4\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes 13 debts which have been charged off, the accounts closed, \nor are delinquent, which total approximately $24,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. The behavior did not happen long ago. The \naccounts were opened in 2005 and 2006 and remain unpaid. There are 13 debts, so the \nbehavior is not infrequent. There is no evidence the obligations were incurred under \nunusual circumstances. The debts appear to be credit card debt, student loans, a car \npurchase, telephone bills, and other bank accounts. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nThere is no evidence of divorce, separation, periods of unemployment, or \nunexpected medical expenses, or other evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwere beyond his control. AG & 20(b) does not apply. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not \napply. There is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling or that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. Applicant\u2019s monthly \nexpenses exceed his monthly income by more than $400. There is no evidence of a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has denied two of the debts, but provided no documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the eligibility for access to sensitive information process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the eligibility for access to sensitive information process.\u201d \n \nUnder AG & 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine eligibility for access to sensitive information eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d and & 16 (b) \u201cdeliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \n\n \n \n \n7\nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative\u201d are security concerns. \n \nApplicant failed to list his delinquent debts on his SF 85P. In June 2008, in the \nwritten interrogatories Applicant acknowledged all but two of the debts. He denies \nfalsifying his SF 85P, but the clear and plain language of the question asked if he was \ncurrently more than 180 days delinquent on any debt. He was delinquent and failed to \nso indicate. He has provided no explanation as to his incorrect answer.  \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am \nunable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to his \ntruthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man, only 21 \nyears old. He has made some mistakes in the past by becoming overextended \nfinancially and unable to repay his obligations in a timely manner. Even now, his \nmonthly expenses exceed his income by $400 or more per month. In June 2008, when \nhe answered the interrogatories, Applicant was made aware of the government\u2019s \nconcerns about his unpaid obligations. Eight months later, there is no evidence \nApplicant has made a payment on any of his debts. Additionally, he failed to explain \nwhy he did not list his delinquent debts when asked about them on his SF 85P.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n \n \n8\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at \nthis time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

On October 17, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns regarding Applicant arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant answered the SOR. She admitted 5 of 10\nallegations under Guideline F and declined to address the single allegation raised under\nGuideline E. She also requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA\nreceived the request and assigned the case to me on March 4, 2009. Applicant and\nJune 23, 2009\n\n      Tr. 8.\n1\n      Tr. 20.\n2\n2\nDepartment Counsel agreed to an April 1, 2009, hearing date. On March 16, 2009, a\nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that date. The hearing was\nconvened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted four documents, admitted as\nExhibits (Exs.) A-D without objection. Applicant introduced no exhibits, but gave\ntestimony. Applicant was given through April 16, 2009, to submit any documents for\nconsideration. An extension was later provided through April 22, 2009. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on April 15, 2009. Applicant\u2019s attempt to send materials by facsimile\ntransmission was unsuccessful on April 20, 2009 due to an erroneous contact number,\nbut Department Counsel ultimately received it on April 27, 2009. Noting no objections,\nDepartment Counsel forwarded two submissions that same day. I received the\nsubmissions on April 28, 2009, and they were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-2. The\nrecord was then closed. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice and Amendment of SOR\nAt the hearing, it was unclear as to when Applicant received the Notice of\nHearing. I advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days\nnotice before the hearing. Applicant effectively waived her right to 15 days notice.1\nAdditionally, Department Counsel moved to amend \u00b6 2.a of the SOR to conform to the\nevidence. Without objection, that allegation was amended to read, in part: \u201cYou falsified\nmaterial facts on a questionnaire for public trust positions executed by you on or about\nAugust 21, 2007, and later amended by you on September 11, 2007. . . .\u201d (Amended\nlanguage in italics). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old operational clerk working for a defense contractor. She\nhas worked for her current employer since the summer of 2007. Applicant completed\nhigh school and completed two years of post-secondary education. Currently separated\nfrom her husband, she has three teenage children.\nFrom December 1999 through February 2002, Applicant worked as a machine\noperator. In February 2002, she was laid off, commencing a year of unemployment.\nAfter several months of unemployment, she pursued college courses to prepare her for\nalternative employment. During her unemployment period, the couple subsisted solely\non her husband\u2019s earnings.  It was during this time Applicant acquired much of the\n2\ndelinquent debt at issue. \nAt issue are the following debts, as noted in the October 17, 2008, SOR as\nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j.\n\n      Tr. 22-23.\n3\n      Tr. 23-25.\n4\n      Tr. 26; Ex. D (Credit report, dated Aug. 8, 2009).\n5\n      Tr. 28; Ex. C (Credit report, dated Sep. 18, 2007).\n6\n      Tr. 28-30.\n7\n      Tr. 34-35.\n8\n      Tr. 35-36.\n9\n      Tr. 37.\n10\n      Ex. 2 (Hospital statements).\n11\n3\n1.a \u2013 Medical Debt ($146) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admits this account remains\ndelinquent.  This amount represents a co-pay incurred by Applicant for dental work\n3\nperformed between 1999 and 2002.\n1.b \u2013 Auto Repossession ($10,760) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant denies this allegation. She\npurchased a 1998 vehicle for about $16,000 which was voluntarily repossessed\nsometime around late 2002. She testified that she paid the balance down to about\n$10,000 at the time of repossession and that the auto was to be auctioned, but\nApplicant offered no evidence to substantiate these assertions.  \n4\n1.c \u2013 Financial Loan ($3,346) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant denies this allegation, which was\ncharged off as bad debt in 2002. The loan originated in 2000 as a $600 loan for vehicle\nrepairs. It was renewed with a high credit noted as $684 before she was laid off in late\n2002.  Interest and fees have increased the balance owed considerably.\n5\n1.d \u2013 Bank Debt ($2533.45) \u2013 IN DISPUTE \u2013 Applicant denies this allegation, which\nwas referred for collection around March 2003. Applicant disputed this account with\nTransUnion and/or Experian.6\n1.e \u2013 Utility Bill ($676) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant denies this allegation, stating the\naccount belongs to her estranged husband.  No evidence to that effect was introduced.\n7\n1.f \u2013 Communications Bill ($175) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant denies this allegation, noting\nshe has no recollection of using this service provider.8\n1.g \u2013 Communications Bill ($488) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation and\nacknowledges the balance owed.9\n1.h \u2013 Medical Debt ($600) \u2013 PAID \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation, regarding a debt\nincurred for medical treatment after a car accident between 2003 and 2005.  Applicant\n10\nprovided evidence that her balance was paid and currently has a zero balance.11\n\n      Tr. 37-38.\n12\n      Tr. 38.\n13\n      Tr. 39.\n14\n      Tr. 42.\n15\n      Tr. 41.\n16\n      Tr. 42-43.\n17\n      Tr. 43-44.\n18\n      Tr. 45.\n19\n      Tr. 46.\n20\n4\n1.i \u2013 Credit Card ($1,369) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation, noting it was a\ncard kept on hand between about 1998 and 1992 for the purchase of larger items.12\n1.j \u2013 Bank Financed Purchase ($292) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation,\nnoting that it was incurred in the purchase of a correspondence course designed to\nlearn new skills.  She was unaware the course would continue to bill her account after\n13\nreceipt of its initial mailings.14\nOn August 21, 2007, Applicant completed and certified her SF-85P. On\nSeptember 11, 2007, her employer\u2019s human resources staff returned it to her to amend\nan answer.  Specifically, she scratched out her \u201cYes\u201d designation in favor of an answer\n15\nof \u201cNo\u201d regarding Question 22(b) (\u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan\nor obligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal\nGovernment\u201d). She changed her answer because \u201cwhen [she] read it, [she] didn\u2019t\nunderstand it at the time. . . . \u2013 \u2013 it seemed like a tricky question to [her].\u201d  She was\n16\nconfused by the reference to \u201cobligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal\nGovernment\u201d and did not equate her past due bills with the \u201cdelinquent\u201d loans and\nobligations referenced.\u201d  This belief was apparently reenforced by the fact she received\n17\nfew calls or letters regarding her past due accounts.   \n18\nCurrently separated from her husband, Applicant\u2019s 18-year-old child lives with\nher. The two younger children reside in another town with Applicant\u2019s mother. They\nremained with their grandmother so they did not have to change school when Applicant\nmoved. When she can, she sends her mother money for their care.  Applicant\u2019s\n19\nhusband provides no financial assistance, but buys things for the children at times.  \n20\nApplicant drives a truck, which she purchased last year and has approximately\n157,000 miles on its odometer. It is currently not insured. She lives in a house she\nbought last year for about $69,000, on which she pays a mortgage of about $500 a\nmonth. She spends about $250 on utilities, $200 on groceries, and $80 on gasoline per\nmonth. She does not have a cell phone. She now earns $8.75 an hour, making about\n\n      Ex. 1 (Student loan statement).\n21\n5\n$17,000 per year. She has a net monthly income of about $1,100. She is not eligible for\novertime pay. Although not at issue in the SOR, the student loans incurred while\nApplicant returned to school in the 2002-2003 period have been repaid in full.21\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks a position of trust enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends normal\n\n6\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive\ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, mostly between\n2002 and 2003 while unemployed. Thus far she has been unable to pay most of her\ndelinquent obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Most of Applicant=s debts became delinquent around the time of her 2002-\n2003 period of unemployment. While it is clear that it is an inability, not an\nunwillingness, to pay her debts, the fact remains progress has only been made on 2 of\n10 obligations. Consequently, this mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\n\n7\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Inasmuch as the\nmajority of debts at issue became delinquent during Applicant\u2019s period of\nunemployment or shortly thereafter, this mitigating condition applies and is a factor for\nconsideration. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c), but Applicant introduced no evidence that\nshe has received such counseling or that any professionals have aided her in\naddressing her delinquent debt. She has, however, formally disputed one account at\nissue, paid her medical bill, and repaid her student loans. Therefore, AG & 20(d), Athe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts,@ applies to a limited extent.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set\nout in AG & 15: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation. Here, Applicant initially indicated she had obligations delinquent over 180\ndays, then scratched out her affirmative answer in favor of a \u201cNo.\u201d She credibly testified\nthat, upon reflection, she was confused by the terms used to define past due bills\n(delinquent loans and financial obligations), especially as it is followed directly by the\ninstruction to \u201c(i)nclude obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\u201d\nWhile the question seems relatively straightforward, it could be honestly misconstrued,\nparticularly by someone financially unsavvy, an individual instructed to change her\nanswer as a corrective measure, or one suspicious of the \u201ctricky\u201d application. For\nexample, the mandate to \u201cInclude loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the\nFederal Government\u201d could be read to specifically depict the type of loans and\nobligations to be noted on the application to the exclusion of any other type of debt.\nSimilarly, a failure to equate past due bills with financial obligations could result in an\nincorrect answer. \nApplicant\u2019s own direct testimony and that elicited by Department Counsel\ndemonstrate her discomfort with regard to financial terminology. Given her credible\ntestimony throughout the proceeding, there is no indication of falsity. Having reviewed\nthe potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline, I find that consideration of\nthis issue is best reserved for analysis under the \u201cWhole Person\u201d concept.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\n\n8\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the exten to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas raised three children, pursued higher education, and struggled to maintain a\nhousehold without financial assistance from her estranged husband. She is also a\nwoman who endured a protracted period of unemployment after being laid off. During\nthat 2002-2003 period of unemployment, she acquired some new debt and older debt\nbecame delinquent. \nIn her favor, Applicant is a modest woman who lives simply and without\nextravagance. Her income, too, is modest. She paid one medical debt and formally\ndisputed one obligation. She also satisfied her student loan obligation. Regardless, she\nhas made little progress on her remaining delinquent debts over the past six to seven\nyears. A debt for $175 she does not recognize has neither been disputed or addressed.\nAnother obligation for $292 is acknowledged, but remains unpaid. A loan in the $600-\nrange has grown to an unwieldy balance in excess of $3,500, while no inquiries have\nbeen made with regard to a repossessed automobile. There is no evidence she has\ntried to settle, consolidate, or repay any of the larger delinquent debts. Overall, the\nrecord evidence leaves questions and doubts unresolved with regard to Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial condition. As noted above, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor\nof national security.\u201d Consequently, I conclude Applicant failed to meet her burden and\nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her finances. Access is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct) for Applicant.  \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \n1 \n \nJune 26, 2009\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nShe answered the SOR in writing on November 21, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 26, \n2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 22, 2009, and I \nreceived the case assignment on February 11, 2009.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 4, 2009, scheduling the case for April \n7, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. The list of \nGovernment Exhibits was marked as Exhibit (Ex.) I. Applicant testified on her own \nbehalf, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received without \nobjection.  \n \nI held the record open until April 21, 2009 to afford the Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional material. On April 17, 2009, Applicant submitted an e-mail request, \nwhich she resubmitted on April 21, 2009, seeking an extension of her submission \ndeadline until May 5, 2009.1 The Government objected to Applicant\u2019s extension request \nstating that Applicant \u201chas had more than ample time to establish payment plans on her \npast due debts.\u201d After due consideration, I granted her request for an extension until \nApril 28, 2009.2 Applicant timely submitted AE E through I without objection.3 DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c., 1.j., and 1.p., and denied the remaining allegations. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old production quality clerk, who has been employed by \nher defense contractor employer since September 2007. GE 1, Tr. 15. She seeks to \nretain access to sensitive information in conjunction with a public trust position, which is \na condition of her employment. Tr. 16-17. \n \n \nApplicant completed high school in February 1985, and attended one semester \nof college. Tr. 13-14. Applicant was previously married three times, and has three adult \nchildren. Applicant is currently not married, but was involved in a four-year relationship \nthat ended in April 2006. Tr. 96. \n \n \n1 Applicant sent her initial e-mail request to Department Counsel using an incorrect e-mail \naddress, which caused a delay in processing her request. \n \n2 The e-mails documenting Applicant\u2019s extension request were marked Ex. II. \n \n3 The Government\u2019s forwarding Memorandum, dated April 29, 2009, was marked Ex. III. \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her September 2007 SF-85P, her July 2008 Answer to DOHA \nInterrogatories, and her September 2007 and September 2008 credit reports. GE 1 \u2013 4. \n \nThe Government alleged in the SOR and established by Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand/or evidence presented that Applicant has/had 18 delinquent debts approximating \n$51,000.00. The debts consist of one federal tax lien, and the remaining debts consist \nof a combination of delinquent, charged off or collection accounts. \n \nThe following chart summarizes debts alleged in Applicant\u2019s SOR, status, record \ncites, and comments as appropriate. \n \nSOR DEBT \nSTATUS \nRECORD \nCOMMENTS \n1.a.

During this relationship, Applicant and her former fianc\u00e9 commingled a \nsignificant portion of their finances and household expenses. Her periods of \nunemployment were from January 2005 to August 2006, December 2006 to February \n2007, and May 2007 to September 2007. She has been continuously employed since \nshe began her current position in September 2007. GE 1. Applicant\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 had \nthree small children and asked Applicant to quit her job to care for his children. Three \nand one-half months after Applicant quit her job, \u201che (former fianc\u00e9) decided he didn\u2019t \nwant to get married . . . .\u201d Tr. 73-76. Applicant stated, \u201c[i]n April of 2006 [her fianc\u00e9] \nthrew me literally physically out of the house.\u201d Tr. 96. The results of Applicant\u2019s \ncommingling of finances during her long-term relationship are reflected in the chart \nabove.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take-home pay is $1,250.00 per month. She lives with her \nparents to save rent and pays them a modest amount to cover expenses. For \ntransportation, she drives her aunt\u2019s car and pays her car-related expenses. She makes \na modest contribution to a 401k retirement account, and maintains a small savings \naccount. Her net monthly remainder is $290.00. Tr. 76-81. \n \nWhen Applicant completed her SF-85P, and executed it on September 5, 2007, \nshe failed to disclose any loan or financial obligation over 180 days delinquent. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.) Applicant explained, she \u201cdid not know about them.\u201d Tr. 82. In response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s questions, she stated: \n \nQ. So you\u2019re stating now at the time that you filled out the application you were \nnot aware that you had any delinquent debts at all? \n \nA. I did not know about the \u2013 \n \nQ. That were over 180 days delinquent? \n \nA. No. \n \nQ. When did you first become aware that you did have those debts? \n \nA. When I received the paperwork from you, the first set of paperwork from the \nGovernment, from you. Tr. 83. \n\n6 \n \n \nAs noted in the above chart, Applicant\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 has submitted a notarized \nstatement acknowledging responsibility for debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g., 1.i., and 1.k. These \ndebts total $38,157.00. Applicant further explained that all of her mail to include bills \nwere going to her former fianc\u00e9\u2019s house. She estimates that she did not receive mail \n\u201cprobably 18 months\u201d until he provided her with a \u201cyellow envelope\u201d in \u201cearly 2008\u201d with \nall of her mail since they separated. Tr. 103. Applicant submitted a change of address \nwith the post office when she left her fianc\u00e9\u2019s house, but claims no mail was forwarded. \nShe added that many of the bills on the SOR were household related commingled \naccounts, which her fianc\u00e9 had been paying, and when she left her fianc\u00e9\u2019s home, \npresumed he would continue to pay those accounts. Tr. 103-105. She stated she paid \nher debts in a timely manner \u201cbefore [her fianc\u00e9] came along, and [she is] doing that \nagain.\u201d Tr. 120. \n \nApplicant did not submit any character references or employee evaluations. She \ndid emphasize that she \u201cloves\u201d her job, that she is \u201cdoing the best [she] can [a]nd \nwithout [her] job [she] can\u2019t do that.\u201d She added that she would rather lose her job than \ndo anything illegal. Tr. 94, 121.  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n7 \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe Guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated 18 delinquent accounts, totaling \n$51,000.00 as noted supra. Her indebtedness began in 1990 with her tax lien and the \nother accounts have been in arrears for several years and have been ongoing. The \n\n8 \n \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a \ncloser examination. \n \nThe Guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Applicant experienced \nseveral periods of unemployment after a long-term failed relationship in which she and \nher former fianc\u00e9 had commingled many of their household and personal accounts. \nThree potential mitigating conditions apply under this concern. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted, Applicant was \ninvolved in a long-term relationship that ended. During this relationship, Applicant\u2019s \nfinances became commingled with those of her fianc\u00e9. When Applicant left her fianc\u00e9\u2019s \nhome, she presumed or believed he was responsible for the majority of the debts \nincurred they had acquired together. To her fianc\u00e9\u2019s credit, he acknowledged \nresponsibility for a majority of debts alleged against Applicant. For the remaining debts, \nApplicant has struggled to address them. On a practical level, Applicant\u2019s position is \nunderstandable, but legally, as she found out, creditors pursue debtors if they have a \nlegal basis to do so. Additionally and after her break-up, Applicant experienced \nsignificant periods of unemployment, the first occurring in 2005 and the most recent \nending in 2007. She has been continuously employed since September 2007. Given the \nfacts as presented, I am able to give Applicant partial credit under this mitigating \ncondition. \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ I note Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are not recent, and she has been employed since September 2007. \nWhile it took some time for Applicant to address her indebtedness, I note that she did \nfile a change of address after leaving her fianc\u00e9\u2019s home and claims she did not receive \nany forwarded mail. She first became aware of the full extent of her indebtedness after \nthe Government initiated these proceedings. Since these proceedings began, I note \nApplicant has become fully engaged in addressing her indebtedness. While she has \nwork to do, she has made considerable progress in addressing each and every debt \nalleged. Her post-hearing submissions shored up missing or incomplete information not \npresented in her hearing. Full credit under this mitigating condition is warranted. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d As the above chart demonstrates, Applicant has \nsuccessfully challenged/disputed a number of her debts and had them removed from \nher credit report. She has also challenged three debts identified and acknowledged by \nher former fianc\u00e9 as debts for which he is legally responsible. While Applicant is not \ntotally exonerated from her legal responsibility as it pertains to these debts, her former \nfianc\u00e9\u2019s notarized statement provides her with a reasonable basis to claim she is not \n\n9 \n \nresponsible for paying these debts. Lastly, she retained counsel to dispute the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. Full credit under this mitigating condition is also warranted. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), the Government\u2019s concern is conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \n \nPosing potential security concerns are Applicant\u2019s documented omissions of her \ndebts over 180 days from her SF-85P submitted in September 2007. Her omissions are \nattributable to her belief that her former fianc\u00e9 had assumed responsibility for the debts \nshe and he had incurred together and those debts that were commingled when they \nwere sharing a household. Adding credence to Applicant\u2019s explanation was her having \nfiled a change of address, which unfortunately did not result in her mail being forwarded \nto her. \n \nHaving had an opportunity to observe Applicant testify, I found her explanation \ncredible in light of the rather unfortunate and unique circumstances she found herself in. \nAdding to the credibility of her explanation is the fact her state of financial responsibility \nwas stable before and after her relationship with her former fianc\u00e9. I found Applicant to \nbe credible and that she acted in good faith. While Applicant could reasonably have \nbeen expected to be more diligent and thorough when answering Question 20, her \njudgment lapses and confusion are not enough to impute knowing and willful \nfalsification under Guideline E.  \n \n\n10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of her omissions is persuasive enough to avert \ninferences of knowing and willful omission. There being no misconduct substantiated, \ndiscussion of Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions is not warranted.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nAs a dedicated employee, Applicant has been willing to do whatever is necessary \nto achieve the state of financial responsibility. She has addressed each creditor and \nsuccessfully mitigated the majority of her debts. She lives a modest lifestyle and does \nnot spend extravagantly. She is doing her level best to recover from the financial fallout \nof a failed relationship. While Applicant\u2019s financial state is not where it should be, it is \nclear from her actions that she takes this process very seriously and is determined to \nresolve her relatively recent adverse credit. Considering her demeanor and testimony, I \nbelieve Applicant has learned from her mistakes, and it is unlikely she will incur future \ndebt that she is unable to pay.  \n \nAlso noteworthy is Applicant\u2019s past behavior, which serves as a reliable indicator \nof future behavior. In particular, the adverse financial history alleged in her SOR arose \nduring her long-term relationship with her former fianc\u00e9 and was exacerbated as a result \nof the way she and her then fianc\u00e9 commingled their finances. When her engagement \nended, so did her support. She struggled to find employment for approximately 18 \nmonths and during that time period, her debts and those debts purported to be hers fell \nbehind. Applicant is living a modest lifestyle and at age 54 finds herself living with her \nparents and driving her aunt\u2019s car to make ends meet. She enjoys her job and \nemphasized she would not do anything inappropriate to net an unlawful gain. Her \nmodest income in this current economy is her lifeline to achieving and maintaining \nfinancial responsibility.  \n \n\n11 \n \n                                                          \nI also considered the facts of the case and nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) supra relating to Personal Conduct concerns. Falsifications are a \ncore security concern. Inasmuch as Applicant\u2019s behavior was not deliberate or willful, no \nmisconduct was established precluding the necessity of further discussion under the \nWhole Person Concept. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable public trust position determination. I take this position based on the \nlaw, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d4 and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible \nfor a public trust position.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 r.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is granted.  \n \nOn April 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 22, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 27, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 16, 2008. On September 11, 2008, the hearing was cancelled because of \nthe threat of severe weather. Another notice of hearing was issued on September 22, \nNovember 10, 2008\n\n2 \n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 8, 2008. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objections. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through S, which were \nreceived without objections. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to \nsubmit additional information. Applicant submitted nine documents, marked AE T \nthrough BB, which were admitted without objections. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nOctober 16, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor providing health care \nservices. His performance appraisals have reflected exceptional job performance. He \nattended college but has not yet obtained a degree. Applicant retired from the United \nStates Army as a Sergeant Major in 2000, after 33 years of service. Almost 24 years of \nhis Army service was on active duty. He served two tours in Vietnam as a corpsman \nand was awarded numerous medals and commendations, including the Bronze Star \nMedal (2nd award) and the Combat Medical Badge. He is married with four children, \nages 26, 24, 22, and 19. His youngest two children are still living at home. The youngest \nis working but does not pay rent. The 22-year-old is not currently working.1 \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with cancer in 2001. His treatment included surgery \nand radiation therapy. He was out of work for about a month and had to change jobs so \nthat he works at a desk. His pay remained the same. He had a second job before his \ncancer diagnosis. Although his cancer did not have an impact on his primary job, he \nwas no longer physically capable of working a second job. His wife has worked part-\ntime since about 2002. Applicant admitted that he had some financial difficulties before \nhe was diagnosed with cancer.2 \n \n \nThe SOR lists 16 delinquent debts totaling about $26,765. Applicant admitted to \nall the SOR allegations, but provided additional information contesting the validity of \nseveral of the debts and indicating that a number of the debts have been paid. \nIndividual debts are address below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of $1,109 to a department store for an \naccount charged off in 2000. Applicant was sent Interrogatories and asked about this \ndebt. He responded on May 11, 2007, \u201cI acknowledge I owe this and intend to do my \nbest to pay it with[in] the next two years.\u201d In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated \nthat this debt was paid in the 1995 to 1997 time frame. He formally disputed the debt via \ne-mail to the department store on August 26, 2008. The department store responded \nthat it was forwarding the e-mail to the customer service representative of the bank that \nissued the department store credit card. Applicant has not received a response from the \nbank. The debt was not discussed in Applicant\u2019s statement provided to an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator in December 2004. The debt is not listed on \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 38-40; GE 1; AE A, B, Q. \n \n2 Tr. at 41-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE E. \n \n\n3 \nthe credit report of April 10, 2007, or the credit report obtained by Applicant on October \n18, 2008.3   \n \n \nApplicant settled the debt of $2,194, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, for $304 on June \n16, 2008. The debt is satisfied and resolved.4  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege delinquent debts of $269 and $279 to two department \nstores for accounts charged off in 2000. Applicant was asked about both debts in \nInterrogatories. He acknowledged responsibility for the debts and that he intended to \npay them. In his response to the SOR, he stated that the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nhas been unable to locate his account. He stated that he paid the debt in \u00b6 1.d on June \n17, 2008. He submitted a copy of his bank statements. A debit of $234 is reflected on \nJune 18, 2008. Neither debt is listed on the credit reports in evidence.5   \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $2,688, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He stated \nthat he is in negotiation with the collection company that now holds the debt and the \ncompany is willing to settle the debt for $537. Applicant is attempting to work out a \npayment schedule with the company. The debt is listed on the credit report of April 10, \n2007, but not the credit report of October 18, 2008.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a debt of $9,087 to a collection company on behalf of a \nfinancial institution. Applicant admitted owing the debt. The collection company is willing \nto settle the debt for $2,989. Applicant is attempting to work out a payment schedule \nwith the company. The debt is listed on the credit report of April 10, 2007, but not the \ncredit report of October 18, 2008.7 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has been paying the debt of $731 to a financial \ninstitution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The debt is listed on the credit report of April 10, \n2007, as $100 past due, with a balance of $731. The debt is not listed on the credit \nreport of October 18, 2008. Applicant has two open accounts with the same financial \ninstitution. He is current on both accounts.8 \n \n \nApplicant paid the debt of $75 to a collection company on behalf of a telephone \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, on June 16, 2008. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a debt of $67 \nto the same telephone company. This is the same debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.9  \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 29-31, 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE T, V, BB. \n \n4 Tr. at 44-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE I, AA. \n \n5 Tr. at 45-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE AA, BB. \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE T, Y, BB. \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE T, U, BB. \n \n8 Tr. at 47-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE T, BB. \n \n9 Tr. at 49-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE L, AA. \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.I alleges a debt of $73 to a collection company on behalf of a cable \nprovider. Applicant indicated that the cable provider waived the amount when he set up \nhis new account with them. He provided documentation that he is not delinquent on his \ncurrent account with the cable provider. The debt is listed on both credit reports in \nevidence.10 \n \n \nApplicant settled the debt of $932 to a collection company on behalf of a \ntelephone company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, for $466 on June 16, 2008. The debt is \nsatisfied and resolved.11  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt of $959 to a collection company on behalf of \na department store for an account charged off in 2000. Applicant admitted owing this \ndebt but stated that the balance was transferred to another financial institution and he \nwas issued a credit card with the $959 as a balance on the account. The debt is listed \non the credit report of April 10, 2007. The credit report of October 18, 2008, lists an \noriginal debt of $420 to the department store, but it indicates that the debt was \n\u201c[t]ransferred to another lender or claim purchased,\u201d and it does not show a balance. A \ndebt to the collection company named in the SOR does not appear on the credit report. \nA debt to the financial institution that Applicant stated now has the debt is listed on the \ncredit report. It shows the debt as \u201ccurrent\u201d with a monthly payment of $34 and a \nbalance of $1,114.12   \n \n \nApplicant settled the debt of $985, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, for $256 on June 9, \n2008. The debt is satisfied and resolved.13  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a debt of $272 to a collection company on behalf of a utility \ncompany. Applicant disputed owing this debt. He indicated the debt is for water \nprovided at a house after he had already moved from the property. He provided \ndocumentation that he is not delinquent on his current account with the utility company. \nHe wants the landlord to pay the water bill, but the landlord has refused. The debt is \nlisted on both credit reports in evidence.14 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged responsibility for the $401 debt to a collection company \non behalf of a telephone company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. He indicated that he would \nmake arrangements to pay the debt within the next six months. He also stated that he \nthought the debt might be a duplicate of another debt. The debt is listed on the credit \nreport of April 10, 2007, but not the credit report of October 18, 2008.15  \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE T, W, BB. \n \n11 Tr. at 50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE M, S, AA, BB. \n \n12 Tr. at 31, 52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE BB. \n \n13 Tr. at 52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE J, AA, BB. \n \n14 Tr. at 53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE T, BB. \n \n15 Tr. at 53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE BB. \n \n\n5 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a delinquent student loan of $6,734. Applicant entered a \nrehabilitation program to bring the debt current. He testified that he made all the \nrequired payments for about 15 months. He provided documentation that he completed \nthe rehabilitation program in September 2008. He still has the loan and is required to \nmake payments, but it is now out of default status and is in good standing.16 \n \n \nApplicant received counseling when he was in the military. He is working \ndiligently at not incurring new delinquent debts and has a plan to pay his delinquent \ndebts and be debt-free by the time he is 65. He has paid other debts that are not \nreflected in the SOR because they were paid before it was issued.17 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n16 Tr. at 53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F-H, R. \n \n17 Tr. at 55-59; GE 3; AE K. \n \n\n6 \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand (c).  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n\n7 \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems go back more than seven years. He is still in the \nprocess of resolving his debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable at this time.  \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with cancer in 2001. His treatment included surgery \nand radiation therapy and he was out of work for about a month. He admitted that he \nhad some financial difficulties before the cancer. Although his cancer did not affect his \nprimary job, he was no longer physically capable of working a second job, which \nimpacted his finances and his ability to address whatever debts were already \ndelinquent. Applicant receives partial consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant received financial counseling in the military. He has made great strides \nin handling his finances. He has paid or settled a number of debts and has a plan to \naddress his remaining debts. He participated in a rehabilitation program for about a year \nto bring his student loan out of default. There are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. His actions are a start on a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.18 AG \u00b6 20(d) is partially applicable. \n                                                          \n18 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \n\n8 \nApplicant disputed owing several debts, but he only provided documentation that \nhe disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to that debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served this country for 33 \nyears and retired as a Sergeant Major. He served two tours in Vietnam as a corpsman. \nHis performance appraisals from his current employer are outstanding. He was stricken \nwith cancer after he retired from the Army. Applicant honestly stated that his cancer was \nnot the primary cause of his financial problems, but it prevented him from working a \nsecond job, which could have accelerated his debt repayment. He has been working at \nresolving his delinquent debts. He provided documentation that many of his debts have \nbeen paid. His finances are not perfect and he still has some delinquent debts, but he is \nclearly on the right path. The Appeal Board has noted that an applicant is not required \nto establish that he has paid every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems \nand taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d19 Applicant has met those \nrequirements. When I balance Applicant\u2019s remaining debts with his service to this \ncountry during war and peace, I find the latter far outweighs the former. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD \nDirective,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 26, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\nReasons (SOR) on July 24, 2008, detailing the trustworthiness concerns under financial \nconsideration. \n \n \nOn July 24, 2008, Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was received. Applicant elected \nto have the matter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment's case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated February 25, 2009. The \nFORM contained 10 attachments.

On April 23, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old training specialist who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since January 2006, and is seeking to occupy a position of trust. At age 21, \nApplicant overextended her credit. (Item 7) She had 9 to 11 credit cards, most of which \nwere opened when Applicant was between 18 and 21 years old.  \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant purchased a vehicle with $410 per month payments. \n(Item 10) Applicant made her payments for a year and a half before the car developed \nmechanical problems, which would have cost $3,000 to $4,000 to repair.

(Item 5) \nApplicant asked the finance company to come and get the car. Applicant owes $10,900 \non the repossessed vehicle.  \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant purchased a 2006 Chevrolet, which was \nrepossessed in May 2007. Applicant stated the vehicle broke down and required \napproximately $3,000 to repair. She allowed the vehicle to be repossessed. (Item 7) \nApplicant owes $8,320 on this vehicle. \n \nApplicant\u2019s March 2006 Credit Bureau Report (CBR) lists 16 student loan \naccounts totaling $68,000 which are listed as being in good standing with Applicant \npaying as agreed. (Items 8) Applicant\u2019s April 2008 and February 2009 CBRs list the \nstudent loans as being deferred.  \n \n \nIn January 2006, when she completed her Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPositions, she stated she was struggling to make ends meet, was paying her current \nbills, but could not afford to take action on her delinquent debt. (Item 5)  \n\n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs lists 21 accounts as being charged off or placed for collection. \nThe accounts include the two vehicle repossessions totaling $19,000 and 19 other \naccounts between $128 and $5,000 each. The record contains no evidence that any of \nthe obligations listed in the SOR have been paid.  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . \n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n \n \n4\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes in excess of $46,000 on accounts which have been past due, \ncharged off, or accounts placed for collection. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is \ndocumented in her credit reports, her personal subject interview by an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator, her SOR response, and her responses to \ninterrogatories. Throughout this process, she had admitted responsibility for the \n\n \n \n \n5\ndelinquent debts. She has provided insufficient documentation to show significant \nprogress in resolving her debts. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s debts were incurred years ago, but they remain \nunpaid. The debts included two repossessed vehicles and past due credit card \nobligations. There is nothing unique about these kinds of debts. These are type of debts \nlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), there is no evidence of circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol that led to her financial problems other than her statements that at some point in \nher life she had to take a different job which paid $4,000 a year less than her prior job \nand the two cars which experienced mechanical problems she could not afford to repair. \nAG & 20(b) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), there is no evidence Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling or that her finances are under control. There is no evidence of a \ngood-faith effort to repay her past due obligations. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply. \nAG & 20(e) does not apply because there is no evidence Applicant disputes the \n\n \n \n \n6\nlegitimacy of the past-due debts or has provided documented proof to substantiate a \ndispute. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred appear to be for \nroutine living expenses. The past due obligations were for credit card accounts and \nvehicle repossession. Because Applicant chose to have this matter handled \nadministratively, I am unable to evaluate her demeanor, appearance, or form a positive \ndetermination as to her truthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was \nsincere, open, and honest. Even if I found for her in these matters, there is no evidence \nof payment on the delinquent debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Consideration: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.u:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks to occupy an Automatic Data Processing Position, designated ADP I/II/III. In her answer to the SOR she admits ten allegations involving delinquent debts that total over $9,500. The largest was over $5,000. In her answer to interrogatories (Item 6) concerning 14 debts, she indicates that one debt for $33 has been paid and another for $756 is being paid in installments. Neither were alleged in the SOR. In her responses to interrogatories, she answered each of the remaining allegations in the identical way stating that are caused by health issues relating to her pregnancy in 2005, her husband\u2019s unemployment, and ,more recently, separation from her husband.

The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960,\nas amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DOD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January, 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n2\n                                     \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Regulation that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue access to sensitive information for her, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether such access should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the\nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated January 26, 2009, was provided to her, and she\nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days. Applicant provided no additional material but\nonly returned the FORM to DOHA. The case was assigned to me on March 19, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the factual allegations of the SOR in her answer. After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\nfact:\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks to occupy\nan Automatic Data Processing Position, designated ADP I/II/III. In her answer to the\nSOR she admits ten allegations involving delinquent debts that total over $9,500. The\nlargest was over $5,000. In her answer to interrogatories (Item 6) concerning 14 debts,\nshe indicates that one debt for $33 has been paid and another for $756 is being paid in\ninstallments. Neither were alleged in the SOR. \nIn her responses to interrogatories, she answered each of the remaining\nallegations in the identical way stating that are caused by health issues relating to her\npregnancy in 2005, her husband\u2019s unemployment, and ,more recently, separation from\nher husband. She also states that she will resolve each account on a monthly basis but\noffers no plan or agreement to do so. She is now a single parent with three daughters.\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n\n3\n                                     \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\nAnalysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude that the following Adjudicative Guidelines provide the standard for\nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n\n4\n                                     \nGuideline F Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d\nApplicant did incur substantial delinquent debts that are unresolved, but offered\nno plan to consolidate them or pay in installments. Thus, the conditions required were\nestablished by the government sufficient to raise a security concern. \nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant may have had medical\nexpenses, family unemployment, and marital problems that were the proximate cause of\nher debts, but no supporting documentary evidence was offered to establish facts to\nprove those assertions, or to establish that responsible action was taken after the debts\nwere incurred. The burden is on Applicant to do so since she has admitted the alleged\ndelinquent debts are hers in her answer.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(d) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. No\nsuch evidence was presented, so this mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. She has provided no supporting\ndocumentary evidence to dispute the debts, or of actions to resolve the debts. This\nmitigating condition also is not applicable. \n\n5\n                                     \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns. Although she stated the problems that led to her delinquent debts,\nshe failed to provide sufficient information about future plans to resolve her delinquent\ndebts that would support application of mitigation under the whole person concept. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting\nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and\ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or\novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible\nfor access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.-j.: Against Applicant \n\n6\n                                     \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a public trust\nposition for Applicant. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 23, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 8, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding under Guideline F is not at issue on appeal.\n1\nApplicant requests a \u201ccompromise\u201d in which he would be allowed to retain a security clearance so that he can\n2\ncontinue to be employed, even if he is not allowed the same level of access (or any access) that he had previously held.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 3.2, there is no authority to deny a clearance at one level but grant a clearance at a lower one.  \u201cAn\nunfavorable clearance decision denies any application for a security clearance and revokes any existing security\nclearance, thereby preventing access to classified information at any level and the retention of any existing security\nclearance.\u201d Id.; See ISCR Case No. 94-0947 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1995).\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate.1\nApplicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose information of security concern in response to four different questions.  Applicant\nhas not demonstrated that the Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nA review of the decision indicates that the Judge reasonably considered Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for why he failed to disclose the information in question in light of the record evidence\nas a whole.  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2007).\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

Miller, Attorney At Law\nDecember 8, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 24, 2007.  On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 5, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on August 22, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nSeptember 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 3, 2008.  On September 23,\n2008, a continuance was granted, and the matter was rescheduled for October 28,\n2008.  The Government offered six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Applicant offered eight exhibits,\nreferred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, and testified on his own behalf.  The\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on November 6, 2008.  Based upon a review\n\n2\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 1.d, alleging \u201cYou\nfalsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) executed by you on July 24, 2007, in response to Section 27.  Your Financial\nDelinquencies, (c) In the last seven years, have you had a lien placed against your\nproperty for failure to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d  (Tr. pp. 69 -70).  Applicant\u2019s counsel\nhad no objection to the motion.  (Tr. p. 70).  The motion to amend the SOR was\ngranted. \n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 45 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an\nAircraft Mechanic and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant joined the United States Air Force in 1983, and served for ten\nyears.  He completed a security clearance application in the military and held a DoD\nsecurity clearance much of that time.  He attained the rank of Sergeant, E-4.  After\nreceiving an honorable discharge, he began working for a defense contractor.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  For a period he and his wife spent beyond their means.  He has\nlearned from his mistakes and the problem has been corrected. \nThe Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on July 15, 2003.  He listed\nliabilities totaling $335,250.00.  His bankruptcy was dismissed on March 13, 2006.  He\nand his wife obtained a loan and were able to pay off all of their outstanding delinquent\ndebt either in full, or through a settlement agreement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  A debt in\nthe amount of $633.00 was paid in December 2005.  (Tr. pp. 45-46).  A debt in the\namount of $18,000.00 for a boat that was voluntarily repossessed was also paid off in\nfull.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B and Tr. p. 62).  Credit reports of the Applicant dated\nSeptember 6, 2007, June 12, 2008, August 20, 2008, and October 27, 2008, reflect the\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy as well as the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6).\n\n3\nThe Applicant is currently meeting all of his monthly expenses.  His total income\nis approximately $9,000.00 a month.  He states that his total monthly living expenses\ntotal $2,033.00.  His debts total $3,444.00.  This totals approximately $5,500.00.  He\nhas about $3,700.00 left over at the end of the month.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and\nTr. p. 37).  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of \nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated July 24, 2007.  Question 27(a) of the application asked the\nApplicant if in the last 7 years had he filed a petition under any chapter of the\nbankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13) The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  He failed to list his Chapter 13\nbankruptcy filed on July 15, 2003.  He explained that because he and his wife\neventually paid off all of their creditors in full, either by full payment or a settlement from\nobtaining a loan, he considered it to be dismissed.  (Tr. p. 39).  He also stated that if he\nhad answered the question \u201cYES\u201d a pop up would appear that required him to know the\nfinancial figures concerning the Bankruptcy and he did not have that information.  (Tr. p\n81).  He would have had to call his wife to get the information.  He planned to explain it\nsometime later to an investigator.      \nQuestion 27(b) of the same application asked the Applicant if in the last seven\nyears have your wages been garnished or has any property been repossessed for any\nreason.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false\nanswer.  He failed to disclose the repossession by Bank of America of the boat he\nreturned because he could no longer make the payments, as set forth in allegation 1(c)\nof the SOR.  The Applicant explained that because he voluntarily surrendered the boat,\nhe believed that the property was not technically repossessed.  (Tr. pp. 41-43).    \nQuestion 27(c) of the same application asked the Applicant if in the last seven\nyears had he had a tax lien against him.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  He failed to disclose the tax lien that\nhad been filed against him in January 2003 that was paid in December 2005.  (Tr. p.\n67).  The Applicant states that he vaguely remembers a tax lien.  (Tr. pp. 67-68).  \nQuestion 28 of the same application asked the Applicant if in the last 7 years\nhave you been 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  This\nwas a false answer.  He failed to disclose that he had been at least 180 days delinquent\non several of his debts, including allegation 1(b) of the SOR.  The Applicant explained\nthat the Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report dated April 30, 2008, that lists the debt set\nforth in 1(b) is erroneous.  He contends that the debt was paid in December 2005 by\nway of a settlement.  (Tr. p. 45).  \n\n4\nTo go to the extent of filing Bankruptcy in the first place, one had to have so\nmuch debt that they are unable to control it.  Applicant was obviously in that situation.  It\nis difficult to conceive that he did not have debt that was at least 180 days delinquent.\nHis credit report reveals a number of collection accounts, although the Applicant has no\nrecollection of such.  (Tr. p. 73 and  Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6).\nFurthermore, when the Applicant completed the security clearance application,\nhe was seated next to his supervisor.  If he had any questions concerning how to\nanswer the questions, he could have easily asked him about them.  (Tr. p. 66).  He did\nnot.  I find that the Applicant was not truthful in answering the questions on the\napplication concerning his past delinquent financial history.  He falsified material facts\non his security clearance application when he failed to list his Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in\nresponse to question 27(a), his voluntary repossession in response to question 27(b),\nhis tax lien in response to question 27(c) and his debt at least 180 days delinquent in\nresponse to question 28.  Clearly the Applicant knew of his financial delinquencies of\nthe past and intentionally sought to conceal the information from the Government when\nhe filled out the security clearance application.  \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s Production Supervisor indicates that the Applicant is\nhighly motivated, honest, reliable, and productive employee.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D). \nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Operation Supervisor reflects\nthat the Applicant is an important asset to the department.  He is considered\nresponsible and reliable.  Awards and certificates further demonstrate the Applicant\u2019s\ntraining and commitment to his field of expertise.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).  \nApplicant\u2019s performance reviews from 1997 through the present reveal ratings\nfrom \u201cvery good\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).\nApplicant has received numerous military commendations as well as certificates\nof training and appreciation for his work in the defense industry.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E\nand H). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\n\n5\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19.(e) consistent spending beyond ones means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n6\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and dishonest (Guideline E).\nThis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Admittedly, the Applicant has made a good faith effort to resolve\nhis past due indebtedness.  He initially filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection and\nafter following the trustee\u2019s plan for a while, was able to obtain a loan and pay off his\ncreditors in full or through a settlement agreement.  He understands the importance of\npaying his bills on time and living within his means.  Under the circumstances, he has\nmade a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial\naffairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\n\n8\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nOn the other hand, the evidence concerning the Applicant\u2019s dishonesty on his\nsecurity clearance application is overwhelming, and none of his excuses are\nreasonable.  The Applicant is an intelligent man who was familiar with the security\nclearance application from his experience in the military.  He clearly understood the\nquestions on the application.  He obviously did not want to disclose any information on\nhis security clearance application that would adversely effect his ability to obtain a\nsecurity clearance.  He intentionally falsified his security clearance application of 2007,\nwhen he deliberately failed to disclose material information concerning his past financial\nhistory.   This intentional deception goes directly to the Applicant\u2019s credibility.  I cannot\nfind that he is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to classified information.  The\nGovernment relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a\nnegative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant has deliberately\nprovided false information about material aspects of his personal background. \nUnder Personal Conduct, Guideline E, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a)  Deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable.   Accordingly,\nGuideline E is found against the Applicant.   \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of his dishonesty and the effects that it can have on his\nability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the SOR.  Paragraph\n1 is found for the Applicant.  \n\n9\n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Zaid, Esq. \n \n \n \n \n________________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude \nthat Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for \nalcohol consumption and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 9, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were \nNovember 4, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                \nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.1  \n \nOn April 1, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed under Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed his notarized Answer to the SOR on May 6, 2009, in \nwhich he admitted all allegations under Guideline G, and all allegations under Guideline \nE, except allegation 1.n. Applicant requested a decision before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 8, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 19, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 9, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted. Applicant testified and presented the \ntestimony of two witnesses. The documents attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer were \nsevered and admitted as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A through P.3 He offered four \nadditional documents at the hearing, which were marked and admitted as AE Q through \nT. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 20, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and has completed about half the credits required to \nearn a bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 101). He is unmarried and has no children (GE 1). \nApplicant began his employment with a defense contractor in 2004, and currently is an \nassistant security manager. This is his first application for a security clearance (GE 1; Tr. \n101-103). \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n3 Department Counsel noted at Applicant's hearing that AE B and AE D, which were taken from the ADS \ntreatment record, were incomplete. GE 4 represents the complete treatment records from which these two \nexhibits are derived. All references to the treatment record, therefore, cite to GE 4 (Tr. 8-9). \n \n\n \nApplicant used illegal drugs while in high school and college, from 1999 to 2002. \nHe used marijuana approximately 20 to 25 times for about one year between 1999 and \n2000 or 2001, or an average of about twice per month. He used Ecstasy about 20 to 30 \ntimes between 1999 and 2001 or 2002, or about once per month. He also purchased \nEcstasy two or three times during this period. Applicant noted in his interrogatory \nresponse that he made an immature decision when he decided to use illegal drugs, and \nhe did it \u201cto fit in.\u201d He has not used illegal drugs since that time, does not associate with \npersons who use illegal drugs, and has no intent to use them in the future (GE 4 at 2-3, \n9). \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in 2000, at about the age of 19. His \nconsumption \u201cvaried a lot, and it would be like, you know, from one drink to maybe like \nfour drinks, five drinks\u2026\u201d (Tr. 108). In his Answer, he states that \u201cWhen I did drink, I \nlimited my consumption to ensure that it did not surpass the point of mild intoxication \ncommonly referred to as being \u2018buzzed.\u2019\u201d (Answer at 2). \n \nApplicant testified that on May 15, 2004, he was at a bar and drank two or three \ndrinks or shots over a period of approximately two hours (Tr. 109). He subsequently was \nstopped by police and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (AE A). In September \n2004, he was found guilty, and sentenced to 30 days incarceration (suspended), \nattendance at Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), one-year driver\u2019s license \nrestriction, (AE A); one-year probation from September 16, 2004 to September 15, 2005 \n(Answer at 2; GE 4 at 32, 41; Tr. 110). He was required to remain abstinent from alcohol \nduring his probation (Tr. 114-115). He attended ASAP from October to November 2004 \n(Tr. 168). His probation officer referred him to Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) for \ntreatment. While there, Applicant attended ADS outpatient group meetings for 1\u00bd hours \ntwice per week from February though June 2005. Applicant's group participation was \ngood, he attended AA 12-step meetings, and his alcohol and drug screenings during this \nperiod were negative (AE C; Tr. 113-114). \n \nApplicant testified that he did not realize he was referred to ADS for alcohol \ntreatment (Tr. 166-69). He thought that the ASAP course pertained to his DWI, and the \nADS treatment was related to his illegal drug use. He believed the ADS counselor said \nneither issue was a major concern because the drug use was not recent, and he had \nstopped drinking alcohol following his DWI. He was angry that he had to attend four \nmonths of treatment, and when he complained he said he learned that the treatment was \nfor his drug use. He only found out during the security clearance process that it was for \nhis alcohol use (Tr. 170). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was completely honest during the ADS \nevaluation (Tr. 169). However, he provided conflicting information about when he last \nconsumed alcohol. Applicant reported during the ADS intake interview that on the night \nof his arrest he drank \u201c3 shots and 3 mixed drinks between 10:30 pm and 12 am\u201d (GE 4 \nat 27, 41, 104). Yet the intake report notes that,  \n \n3\n \n\n \nThe client reports the following: His last use of alcohol was 5/15/04, the night \nof the DWI arrest and he consumed 3 shots and 3 mixed drinks. However, he \nreported to ASAP that since his arrest he has been drinking 1-2 times a week,  \n3-4 mixed drinks. (GE 4 at 40). \n \n \nApplicant's statements during treatment appear contradictory. He reported that his \nschool, home life, and relationships got \u201cmessed up\u201d when he was using alcohol. He also \nadmitted that he had a problem with alcohol (Tr. 38). But he also stated that he did not \nneed treatment because \u201che had stopped drinking and had been clean from alcohol and \ndrugs for 9 months.\u201d He denied having any guilt or concern, and stated that he would \naccept a recommendation for outpatient but not residential treatment. He also stated that \n\u201cIf he accepts a recommendation, it will be only because he is ordered to do so as a \ncondition of his probation.\u201d (GE 4 at 30, 36, 38-39).  \n \n \nDuring the AA meetings he attended while in treatment, he did not admit having \nan alcohol problem: \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL:  Right.  And as part of the AA meetings, \nyou have to acknowledge that you have a problem with alcohol.  \n  \nAPPLICANT: Not true.  You can attend the AA meetings, and you can \nbe an observer\u2026But you are not required to actually participate and \nstand up and say, \"Hi, my name is  So and So, and I am So and So.\" \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL:  So did you ever do that? \n \nAPPLICANT:  No. (Tr. 157-158) \n \nHe stopped attending AA meetings after completing treatment in June 2005 (Answer at \n4). At the hearing, he said the DWI conviction was a problem, but not his alcohol use: \n\u201cDo I think that because of my alcohol consumption I had a problem? No, because if that \nwas the case, then I would never have began drinking again. So I really think that had \nmore to do just with things that I was surrounding myself around, things like that.\u201d \n(Answer at 5; Tr. 122-124, 159-160, 173). \n \nAt his discharge from ADS in June 2005, Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol-\ndependent based on symptoms including tolerance, using more alcohol than \nanticipated, withdrawal symptoms, attempts to reduce use, and continued use despite \nphysical/psychological consequences (GE 4 at 106, 108-109). Applicant testified that he \nwas not informed at discharge that he was alcohol-dependent, or that he should remain \nabstinent, and learned of his diagnosis in 2008, when he completed his DOHA \ninterrogatories: \u201cI was not -- I guess I didn't know that I was required to be abstinent.  I \nthought, if anything, it was a recommendation, and really, I don't recall them ever saying \nanything about it at the time of the discharge.  It is such a long time ago.\u201d (Tr. 115-116, \n119). The three recommendations in the discharge report were to \u201cmaintain sobriety, \n4\n \n\n \nemployment and living arrangement.\u201d The report described his status at discharge as, \n\u201cabstinent, has a positive attitude, attends group, attends AA meetings, is gainfully \nemployed and lives with family.\u201d (GE 4 at 111-112). Applicant testified that he did not \ndrink alcohol during his probation from September 2004 to September 2005. He also \nstated that he remained abstinent for an additional year, from September 2005 to about \nOctober 2006. In November 2006, he had a drink at his birthday party. He may have \nhad one drink at a party in December 2006. He was then abstinent for another year, \nuntil about November 2007.  \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated at ADS again in May 2009. Applicant met with a \ncounselor for approximately one hour. The counselor had access to Applicant's \ntreatment records. (Tr. 170-71). Her report indicates that Applicant \u201chas applied for a \nsecurity clearance and his dependency diagnosis is being viewed negatively.\u201d His \ndiagnosis form states that his \u201calcohol dependence is in full, sustained remission.\u201d \nTreatment was not recommended based on Applicant\u2019s \u201cself-reported minimal use of \nalcohol, i.e., one drink or less, four times a year and lack of new or continued life area \nimpairments.\u201d (AE Q, R). \n \n \nBetween 2001 and 2006, when Applicant was 19 to 24 years old, he was cited for \nten traffic infractions,4 which included speeding, reckless driving, driving with a \nsuspended license, operating an uninspected vehicle, failure to obey traffic signs, \noperating an unlicensed vehicle, and unauthorized use of a disabled placard. In eight of \nthese cases, Applicant was found guilty and fined; in two cases, he was found guilty of \nreduced charges. In addition, he was arrested in 2005 for Resisting Arrest and \nTrespassing; he challenged these charges, and the Resisting Arrest charge was \ndismissed. He was found guilty of a reduced charge of Disturbing the Peace. On June \n27, 2009, Applicant completed an online driving safety course (Answer at 13-14; GE 2, 3; \nAE E-I, K-O, S).  \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application on August 9, 2007. Section \n25 asked if, within the previous seven years, his use of alcoholic beverages had \nresulted in treatment or counselling. Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and added, \u201cThese were \nclasses I had to attend for my DUI. Since my involvement with these classes and my \nDUI, I do not drink alcoholic beverages anymore.\u201d At the hearing, Applicant explained \nhis entry in his security clearance application as, \u201cI never intentionally meant to say that \nI do not drink alcohol anymore.  At the time when I completed the document, I was not \ndrinking at all.  That is exactly what I meant\u2026. It wasn't that I was trying to say that I had \nnot drank at all.  It is just that I had not drank at that time, and it had been a while since I \nhad drank.\u201d (Tr. 127-128).  \n \n5\n                                                \nIn September 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). Applicant told the agent that he meant to say on the \napplication that he rarely consumes alcohol (GE 1, 4 at 23). When asked at the hearing \nwhat he told the agent, he testified, \u201cBasically, when he was saying -- he said, basically \nverbatim, he had told me what I wrote in my eQIP application, and what I explained to \n \n4 This number does not include his arrest for Driving While Intoxicated in June 2004.  \n \n\n \nhim was at the current time of my eQIP application, I was conveying I was not drinking \nat all, but I may have a drink.\u201d (GE 4 at 23; Tr 130). During his security interview, \nApplicant made several statements that conflicted with information he provided to his \nalcohol counselors or during his hearing. Among the statements Applicant made to the \ninvestigator, under oath, were the following: \n \n- that he started drinking socially after his probation ended in September 2005, \nalthough in his Answer he states that his alcohol consumption started after the \nend of his treatment in June 2005 (GE 4 at 23; Answer at 5).  \n \n- that he had no citations after July 2005, although he was cited for infractions in \nAugust 2006 (GE 4 at 22); \n \n- that he had four drinks on the night of his DWI (GE 4 at 27), although he told \nthe counselor that it was six drinks (GE 4 at 27), and testified at the hearing that \nit was two or three drinks (Tr. 109); \n \n- that alcohol has not had negative effects on his life, and that he never abused it \n(GE 4 at 22), despite his DWI; the negative effects it had on his home life, \nstudies, and relationships; and his alcohol treatment; \n \n- that he did not drink alcohol when he was under the legal age (GE 4 at 22), \nalthough he admitted to underage drinking in his Answer (Answer at 1). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant's friend, who has known him since childhood, testified \nthat Applicant is focused on his job, does not associate with the \u201cparty\u201d group that he \nused to associate with, and has matured in the past several years (Tr. 29-33). \nApplicant's current supervisor, the company Facility Security Officer (FSO), also testified. \nHe has known Applicant since August 2004. He has been promoted twice. Applicant \nhandles proprietary and confidential information. He can be counted on to run the \ndepartment and make decisions in the supervisor\u2019s absence. Applicant is dependable, \nprompt, and trustworthy, and he did not believe that Applicant's \u201cminor traffic offenses\u201d \nwould be a problem in obtaining a clearance (Tr. 60). He knows Applicant outside of \nwork, and has seen Applicant drink one or two drinks on social occasions, and never \nsaw him become intoxicated. If he has any alcohol, arrangements are made for another \ndriver or his girlfriend to take him home (Tr. 81). Based on his talks with Applicant, he \nbelieves that the treatment program found that Applicant was not alcohol dependent (Tr. \n66-67; 81-82). Applicant mentioned the following reasons why he went to treatment: \n \n\u2026to follow up and close some things and what not to make sure that he \nhad the proper paperwork  and what not, because he  realized  how  this \nwas really a career breaking decision for him and what not. So he wanted \nto make sure he had all the i\u2019s dotted and t\u2019s crossed and what not. So he \ndid, in fact, go, I  guess, to get some  documentation  to  bring to the court \nthat showed he wasn\u2019t, in fact, alcohol dependent (Tr. 82-83). \n6\n \n\n \n \n \nApplicant also submitted letters from his mother and his girlfriend. His girlfriend \nhas known him for two years. She attests to Applicant's maturity and efforts to avoid \nsituations or people that would be negative influences. She stated that he currently \ndrives responsibly. His mother\u2019s letter explained that she was responsible for license tag \nrenewal in 2004 and 2006, and Applicant\u2019s citation for expired tags was due to her \nmistake. She also noted that when Applicant used illegal drugs and alcohol in high \nschool and college, his grades declined, their relationship deteriorated, and he \u201cstarted to \nget into trouble.\u201d She noted that after the DUI, he improved and became more mature \nand focused5 (AE J, P).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nthe cited guidelines.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision resolves only the questions of whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest7 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing \nadmissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a \nsecurity clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to \nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one \nhas a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.8  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \n7\n                                                 \n5 Applicant also submitted a letter from his father, in which he disavowed statements attributed to him by \nthe OPM investigator. However, the record evidence does not include information about such statements \n(AE T). \n6 Directive 6.3. \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). \n \nOf the seven conditions listed at AG \u00b6 22, the following may be disqualifying in \nthis case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol, sometimes to the point of intoxication, between \n2000 and 2004. His family life, relationships, and studies suffered during the period \nwhen he was drinking significant amounts of alcohol. In 2004, he was arrested when he \ndecided to drive after becoming intoxicated. These facts support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(a) and 22(c). \n \n8\n                                                \nIn June 2004, Applicant was arrested for DWI. He was sentenced, inter alia, to \none year of probation, attendance at ASAP, and alcohol treatment. Applicant was also \nordered to remain abstinent during his one-year probation. He completed six months of \n \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \noutpatient treatment from January to June 2005. His intake and discharge report shows \na diagnosis of alcohol dependence. At discharge, it was recommended that Applicant \nmaintain the sobriety he had established during treatment. Applicant has resumed \ndrinking since completing his treatment. AG \u00b6 22(d) and 22(f) apply.10  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four mitigating conditions, of which the following relevant: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related behavior was frequent: he consumed alcohol for \nseveral years, and drank to the point that he used poor judgment by driving while \nintoxicated. Although his DWI is not recent, and he has reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, the fact that he continues to drink alcohol raises concerns that negative \nalcohol-related events may recur in the future. In addition, the fact that he has failed to \ncomply with the recommendation to abstain reflects poorly on his current judgment. AG \n\u00b6 23(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b), as he successfully \ncompleted alcohol treatment. However, his conduct indicates that he has never \naccepted the fact that he had a problem with alcohol: he never admitted it during any \nAA meetings, and he stated that he would only accept the counselor\u2019s \nrecommendations because he was ordered to do so as a condition of probation. Even \n9\n                                                 \n10 The DOHA Appeal Board has held that when interpreting the term \u201cduly qualified medical professional,\u201d \nadministrative judges should construe it broadly and be guided by common sense. Moreover, the medical \nprofessionals that can be considered are not limited to the examples listed at AG \u00b6 22(d). Applicant was \ntreated by counselors employed by an alcohol treatment center. The intake and staffing reports and the \nJanuary 2005 diagnosis form were signed by a registered nurse who is also a certified substance abuse \ncounselor (CSAC). I conclude that Applicant\u2019s diagnosis falls under AG \u00b6 22(d). See ISCR Case No. 07-\n00558 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr 7, 2008).  \n \n \n\n \nas recently as his hearing, he said that his problems were caused not by alcohol. His \ntestimony that he did not understand that the ADS treatment was for alcohol use is not \ncredible, as he was participating in AA meetings during treatment. Finally, his current \noccasional alcohol consumption would be mitigating only if he had been diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser. But because his diagnosis was alcohol dependence, AG \u00b6 23(b) \nrequires that he abstain from alcohol consumption. The mitigation available for \ncompleting court-ordered alcohol treatment is limited because Applicant has not \naccepted his diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and has failed to follow the \nrecommendation to abstain from alcohol use.  \n \nApplicant receives partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(d) because he completed the \ncourt-ordered alcohol treatment program, and recently resumed participation in AA. \nHowever, Applicant failed to meet other elements required under this mitigating \ncondition. He moderated his drinking but did not follow his counselor\u2019s recommendation \nto remain abstinent. He stopped participating in AA as soon as the treatment ended, \nand only resumed on May 6, 2009, the date he completed the Answer to the SOR. It \nappears that he resumed AA attendance as a response to the security clearance \nprocess, rather than as a good-faith effort. Finally, his recent diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence in sustained remission must be viewed in light of the fact that the counselor \narrived at her opinion solely based on a one-hour meeting at which Applicant self-\nreported his alcohol usage, and the evidence shows Applicant has misrepresented facts \nrelated to his alcohol use numerous times during the treatment and the security \nclearance process. The evaluation also provides no prognosis for the future, as AG \u00b6 \n23(d) requires. Taking all the facts and circumstances together, the limited mitigation \navailable under Guideline G is insufficient to overcome Applicant's disqualifying \nconduct.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \n10\n \n\n \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under \nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a \nwhole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to \nconsideration of\u2026(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana and ecstasy from 1999 to 2001 or 2002. As his usage \noccurred seven years ago, it is not recent, and is not sufficient to be disqualifying under \nthe drug abuse guideline. However, it does demonstrate conduct that falls under \nGuideline E because it reflects questionable judgment and unwillingness to abide by the \nlaw. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \n \nOver a five-year period spanning 2001 to 2006, Applicant committed ten traffic \nviolations, and was also charged and fined for disturbing the peace. Taken together, his \nrepeated violations demonstrate that Applicant places his own desires above the law. \nWhile the traffic infractions do not fall under any specific guideline, they raise serious \nconcerns about Applicant's judgment, and constitute a pattern of conduct showing his \nwillingness to disregard rules. AG \u00b6 1 (d)(3) applies.  \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified information that he \nprovided on his security clearance application, which implicates AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant \nsigned a certification that the information he provided was true, but stated on his \napplication that, \u201cSince my involvement with these classes and my DUI [sic], I do not \ndrink alcoholic beverages anymore.\u201d Applicant is an intelligent, articulate man and used \nplain, straightforward language that can mean nothing other than that he had stopped \nconsuming alcohol as of the date of his DWI. But, in fact, he did begin to drink alcohol \nagain either after his treatment ended in June 2005 (see Answer) or after his probation \nended in September 2005 (see hearing testimony). His explanation during his interview \n11\n \n\n \nthat he meant to say he that he rarely used alcohol is not credible. Applicant deliberately \nfalsified his security clearance application, and AG \u00b6 16(a) applies.  \n \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is relevant: \n \nthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nA significant amount of time has passed since Applicant\u2019s drug use \u2013 approximately \nseven years \u2013 and he has not engaged in such abuse since 2002. His drug use is \nmitigated. However, in 2001, at about the time his drug use ended, his series of civil \ninfractions began. They have continued up to 2006, just three years ago. On average, \nhe was involved in some kind of infraction about twice each year. Although most of \nthese infractions are not criminal in nature, they do demonstrate Applicant\u2019s inability or \nunwillingness to abide by rules, such as traffic laws, and raise doubts about his good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) cannot be applied to these infractions. It also does not mitigate \nApplicant's falsification, which occurred, not in the distant past, but just over two years \nago. Neither is it minor; the security clearance process depends on applicants providing \naccurate and honest answers to questions posed in security clearance applications. \nApplicant's failure to be candid in his application casts serious doubt on his \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is also relevant to Applicant\u2019s falsification: \n \nthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant informed his supervisor, the FSO, that he had \nprovided false information on his security clearance application. Applicant's falsification \nsurfaced only when he was confronted by the investigator at his interview. AG \u00b6 17(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n12\n \n\n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, and began using illegal drugs and consuming alcohol \nwhile he was a minor, at about age 19. Applicant was young and immature when he \nbegan these activities. His illegal drug use ended in 2001 or 2002, and it is no longer a \nsecurity concern.  \n \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s alcohol use is a concern. He continues to minimize its \nsignificance, despite the problems it caused in his home life, his studies, and in his \nclose relationships. In 2004, he drove while intoxicated, was convicted of DWI, served \none-year probation, and participated in five months of court-ordered alcohol treatment. \nHe was not committed to AA attendance, and ended it in 2005, when it was no longer \nrequired as part of his treatment; his current attendance at AA appears to be primarily a \nresponse to the security clearance process. Although Applicant's current alcohol use is \noccasional, it is a concern in light of his alcohol dependence diagnosis and his alcohol \ncounselor\u2019s recommendation that he abstain from any alcohol consumption. His conduct \nraises doubts about his acceptance and understanding of the condition that his \ncounselor diagnosed. \n \n \nApplicant was involved in numerous civil infractions between 2001 and 2006, \naveraging two per year for five years, indicating an inability or unwillingness to abide by \nthe law. Finally, Applicant falsified information he certified as true on his security \nclearance application; he provided false information to the government investigator \nwhile under oath; and he provided false information to his alcohol counselors. \nApplicant's conduct raises concerns about his maturity, trustworthiness, judgment, and \nultimately, his suitability to hold access to classified information. \n \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the alcohol \nconsumption and personal conduct guidelines. Overall, the record evidence fails to \nresolve the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.c. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n13\n \n\n \n \n14\n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAGAINST Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. - 2.b.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c. - 2.n.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with explanations, and denied SOR \u00b6 2.a (Item 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old.4 He has worked for a federal contractor since November 1997 in the area of maintenance. He married in 2002. He was previously married from 1996 until 1998. His four children were born in 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2005. He is in the process of being divorced (AE 3 at 1). He served in the military from 1993 to 1997, and received an honorable discharge.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 2, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86). On May 12, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified \n \n1Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 12, 2008). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nand revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 11, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated June 18, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 \ndays. On August 15, 2008, the case was assigned to me. On August 19, 2008, I sent an \nemail to Department Counsel seeking additional information about whether there was \u201ca \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt\u201d described in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n(Appellate Exhibit (AE) 1). On August 27, 2008, Department Counsel provided \nadditional information (AE 3 at 1-2). On August 28 and September 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel sent additional documentation (AE 4, 5). Department Counsel did not object \n(AE 2), and I admitted AEs 4 and 5 (AE 2).   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with explanations, and \ndenied SOR \u00b6 2.a (Item 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old.4 He has worked for a federal contractor since \nNovember 1997 in the area of maintenance. He married in 2002. He was previously \nmarried from 1996 until 1998. His four children were born in 1994, 1999, 2004 and \n2005. He is in the process of being divorced (AE 3 at 1). He served in the military from \n1993 to 1997, and received an honorable discharge. He attended a community college \nfrom August 2004 to December 2006. He has no police record, except for a 1995 \nincident involving driving under the influence of alcohol, which resulted in punishment \nunder Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice. He has not used or trafficked in illegal \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated June 19, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated June 25, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant \nthat he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n4Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \ndrugs in the last seven years, and has never used illegal drugs while in a sensitive \nposition. In the last seven years he has not been fired, quit or left employment under \nunfavorable circumstances. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \n(1) Foreclosed residential dwelling \n \nApplicant purchased a home in 1999, and subsequently took out a second \nmortgage at a high interest rate to complete some home improvements (AE 3 at 1). The \nmortgage was in the amount of $30,000 (Item 5 at 8). In 2002, Applicant remarried and \ndecided to move to a different residence and rent out the home purchased in 1999 (AE \n3 at 1). Tenants damaged the residence (AE 3 at 1). Applicant could not afford the \nmortgage on the residence, repairs, and payments on his new residence (AE 3 at 1). \nApplicant sold his motorcycle to raise money to carry the mortgage until the residence \nwas sold (AE 3 at 1). He was unable to sell the residence, and it went into foreclosure \n(AE 3 at 1). He subsequently went to the residence, discovered the locks were \nchanged, and the house had been seized by the creditors (AE 3 at 1). He stated, \u201cI \nbelieved that since they took possession of the house without notice it was a done deal. \nTime [] passed . . .\u201d Eventually, Applicant received a voicemail from the creditor. He \ncalled the creditor and learned the creditor wanted a down payment of $900 and $700 \nper month (AE 3 at 2).  He informed the creditor he was unable to afford such \npayments. \n \nApplicant admitted that he owed a creditor approximately $28,238 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nApplicant explained that when his first residence was foreclosed, he was not aware that \nthat a second mortgage debt remained after the foreclosure (Item 3). He did not hear \nanything from the creditor until interviewed by a Department of Defense investigator \nsometime after October 2007 (Item 3). Applicant stated, \u201cI have never been through a \nforeclosure before and knew nothing about what was going to happen. I assumed that \nlosing the house was my punishment and [resulted in] settlement [of] the debt.\u201d (Item 3 \nat 3).  \n \nOn March 31, 2008, creditor filed a lawsuit to collect the note, Applicant executed \non May 5, 2001 (AE 5 at 2). A letter from Applicant\u2019s counsel, dated April 14, 2008, \nstates, \u201cThis matter is a contested civil action that was recently filed. A trial date for this \ncase has not been set at this time.\u201d Applicant\u2019s lawyer offered to discuss this matter with \nsecurity officials (Item 6 at 3). His counsel further indicated his belief that Applicant was \nunaware of his responsibility for this debt because he did not disclose it in the course of \nthe divorce proceedings when debt and child support responsibilities were allocated (AE \n5 at 2). \n \nOn September 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel averred he did not receive notice of \nthe collection action on his note, and stated, \u201cHopefully, [Applicant] will prevail in this \nlitigation. However, should he not prevail, [he] will set up a payment schedule with the \ncreditor in order to curtail this debt.\u201d (AE 4 at 2). In the lawsuit, Applicant contests part of \n\n \n \n4 \n \nthe complaint and asks the court to dismiss the lawsuit and assess costs against the \nplaintiff (AE 4 at 3, court filing, dated April 10, 2008). His counsel indicates Applicant \nhas already testified candidly in the court hearing (AE. 5 at 2).   \n \n(2) Credit Report \n \nApplicant\u2019s file contains an 18-page credit report, dated October 16, 2007 (Item \n5). It shows approximately 50 creditor entries (Item 5 at 3-17), including multiple obvious \nduplications (See, e.g., Item 5 at 13-15). This credit report includes comments such as \n\u201cACCOUNT PAID SATISFACTORILY,\u201d pays \u201cAS AGREED,\u201d and \u201cACCOUNT LEGALLY \nPAID IN FULL.\u201d For example, a real estate mortgage account for $117,840 was paid \nsatisfactorily in December 2006 (Item 5 at 12). A car loan account for $31,416 was paid \nsatisfactorily in 2001 (Item 5 at 11). A car loan of $42,357 in 2004 was paid as agreed \nand closed in 2006 (Item 5 at 15). There are several indications of late payments on \nsome accounts. As for his foreclosure, it indicates \u201cVETERANS ADMINISTRATION \nREAL \nESTATE \nMORTGAGE \nACCT \nSTATUS: \nCLOSED \nFORECLOSURE \nPROCEEDINGS \nINITIATED; \nLAST \nREPRTED \nDELINQUENCIES: \n03/2006=M, \n02/2006=M; \nCREDIT \nGRANTOR \nRECLAIMED \nCOLLATERAL \nTO \nSETTLE \nDEFAULTED MORTGAGE\u201d (Item 5 at 12).  He has a current car loan for about $12,000 \nthat is paid as agreed (Item 5 at 10).      \n \n(3) Personal Financial Statement (PFS) showing negative income \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.b, when he prepared his PFS he indicated a monthly negative net \nremainder of $2,741. In his SOR response, he explained that he did not include \novertime pay in his income (Item 3). His PFS has a monthly gross salary of $5,125 with \ntotal monthly deductions $3,968 (Item 6). He also has $2,062 in monthly alimony and \nchild support, and about $890 in other monthly expenses (Item 6).  His monthly debt \npayments are $943. His PFS includes the comment, \u201cI am currently going through a \ndivorce. I have lawyer\u2019s fees of $200 per hour. I am also being sued by [the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a] for said amount. I am living pay check to pay check and work as much \novertime as I can to make ends meet.\u201d (Item 6 at 4). \n \nApplicant attached a photocopy of a weekly pay statement, which indicates \nweekly gross pay for 40 hours of $915 and holiday double time pay for 8 hours of $366. \nAs of April 13, 2008, Applicant had earned $31,817 or about an average of $9,000 \nmonthly. This weekly pay statement shows double time payments of more than $10,000 \nfor the period January 1, 2008, to April 13, 2008. It also shows weekly garnishment of \n$105, and a child support payment of $290.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nSection 27 of Applicant\u2019s SF 86, executed on October 2, 2007, contains answers \nto two questions that are relevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his SF 86: \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nSection 27: Your Financial Record . . . b. In the last 7 years have you \nhad your wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any \nreason? . . . d. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against \nyou that have not been paid? \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cYes\u201d to both questions and explained that his home was \nforeclosed in August 2005, and he owed $45,000 (Item 4 at 26).  \n \nThe SOR alleged that he falsified his SF 86 when he answered, \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n28b, which asked \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  \nApplicant explained in his SOR response that at the time he completed his SF 86 he \nwas not 90 days delinquent on this debt. The first time he learned of the $28,000 debt\u2019s \ndelinquency, as described above, was when he was interviewed by a Department of \nDefense investigator after October 2, 2007 (Item 3 at 3). He received the court \ndocumentation concerning the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in May 2008 (Item 3 at 3).  There is no \nevidence in the file to contradict Applicant\u2019s statement that he did not know the $28,000 \ndebt was delinquent on October 2, 2007.  \n \nA credit report dated October 16, 2007, indicates the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was \nprovided to the credit reporting company in September 2007 (Item 5 at 12).  The credit \nreport includes the following information about how long the debt was delinquent, \u201cLast \nreported delinquencies: 09/2007 = I, 08/2007 = I.\u201d The \u201cLAST ACT\u201d on account is listed \nas 09/07 (Item 5 at 12). A separate listing shows a \u201cLAST ACT\u201d on account of 05/01 \nwith a reporting date of 09/07.  \n \nAs to the first trust on the foreclosure, his credit report indicates a last act on \naccount of 04/05 and a comment, \u201cFORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED; LAST \nREPORTED \nDELINQUENCIES: \n03/06=M, \n02/2006=M; \nCREDIT \nGRANTOR \nRECLAIMED COLLATERAL TO SETTLE DEFAULTED MORTGAGE.\u201d    \n \nApplicant states he completed his security clearance documentation honestly \nand to the best of his ability (AE 3 at 1). Applicant noted he is faced with \u201chuge child \nsupport\u201d in connection with his divorce (AE 3 at 2). He was unable to provide additional \ndocumentation because his papers are stored at his soon to be former spouse\u2019s \nresidence (AE 3 at 2). He is \u201cworking and striving straighten out [his] finances,\u201d but he \nmay have to file for bankruptcy as the best remaining option (AE 3 at 2).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                           \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n5 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, and his SOR \nresponse. As indicated in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he had one delinquent debt for about $28,000. \nSometime in 2005 or 2006, he stopped making payments on a rental property and the \nproperty went into foreclosure. The creditor has not been paid. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                           \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. The $28,000 debt is in litigation. A court hearing has been held. If Applicant loses \nthe lawsuit, he promises to set a payment plan. There was also a Veteran\u2019s \nAdministration loan on the property for about $49,450. The foreclosure apparently \nresulted in the settlement of the defaulted mortgage (Item 5 at 12). Because there are \ntwo delinquent debts, the financial problems are not isolated. The ongoing nature of the \n$28,000 debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d This is the only rental property where he had a problem meeting the \nmortgage payments. That property has been foreclosed, and he no longer owns it. His \ncredit report (Item 5) does not list any other similar financing. Finally, his financial \nrecords show he had faithfully paid or resolved numerous debts over the years without \nany other delinquent accounts. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he receives partial mitigation \nbecause his financial situation was damaged through divorce litigation. However, he did \nnot provide sufficient information to establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.7  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not provide evidence of \nfinancial counseling. Moreover, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant \nshowed good faith8 in the resolution of his $28,000 debt. \n \n7\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \n\n \n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that his April 2008 PFS shows Applicant had such a large \nmonthly negative cash flow, he was unable to meet his financial obligations. However, \nthere is insufficient evidence to show he actually had a significant negative cash flow. \nThe pay statement attached to the PFS shows much greater income than Applicant \nindicated on his PFS. Moreover, it is possible that he duplicated the \u201cTotal Deductions \n$3,968\u201d and \u201cAlimony/Child Support/Day Care $2,062\u201d entries. Accordingly, I find the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b to be unsubstantiated. I will find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d for SOR \u00b6 1.b in \nthe decretal paragraph of this decision.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not fully applicable to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.a because the Applicant did \nadmitted he owed the $28,000 debt, and only disputed the notice on the foreclosure. \nTheoretically, he could have sold the house himself or through a realtor and mitigated \nthe amount of the debt. It is possible the creditor will lose the lawsuit because of the \nlack of notice. He is credited with providing \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis \nof the dispute\u201d with respect to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient correspondence with his creditor for SOR \u00b6 \n1.a to establish he acted responsibly and in good faith from 2005 up to May 2008. He \nshould have been more diligent and made greater efforts to resolve his delinquent debt, \nespecially after receipt of the SOR. It would have been preferable, for example, if he \nhad set aside money every month in the event he looses the lawsuit to fund a payment \nplan.  \n \nI conclude, however, his overall conduct with his creditors does not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His financial problems appear \nto be limited to one $28,000 debt, and causation of that debt is sufficiently unique as to \nbe unlikely to recur. He is an honest, hard working employee and a veteran. He is \nuneducated about financial matters. His inability to complete the PFS, followed by his \ninability to provide full information about why his PFS was flawed speaks volumes about \nhis lack of financial acumen. He has carried his burden of proving his financial \nresponsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude \nwhile no mitigating conditions fully apply, they cumulatively mitigate security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n                                           \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted \nrequired information on his 2007 SF 86.  Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification of Section 28b \nof his SF 86 is not substantiated. AG \u00b6 17(f) provides a condition that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns in this case, stating, \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a \nsource of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Although he \nadmitted preparing his SF 86, and answering incorrectly, he did not know the status of \nthe $28,000 debt.9 He thought the debt was released or extinguished through the \nforeclosure of the house. He disclosed the foreclosure on his SF 86, alerting the \ngovernment to the issue of his financial problems. There is no evidence of his intent to \nconceal information. When a Department of Defense investigator asked him about this \ndebt, there is no evidence that he denied responsibility or attempted to evade the issue \nconcerning the $28,000 delinquent debt. As indicated previously, the PFS he submitted \n \n9The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n \n11 \n \nfailed to take into account his overtime pay and significantly understated his income. \nWhen he responded to interrogatories he again unstated his income. Fortunately, he \nattached a pay statement to the PFS, which indicated substantial overtime pay. These \nfinancial errors show his state of mind and lack of financial sophistication. I conclude he \ndid not knowingly attempt to mislead the government about his financial situation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  For purposes of the whole person analysis in \nthis case, I will presume that none of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply.  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. His PFS includes the \ncomment, \u201cI am currently going through a divorce. I have lawyer\u2019s fees of $200 per \nhour. I am also being sued by [the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a] for said amount. I am living \npay check to pay check and work as much overtime as I can to make ends meet.\u201d (Item \n6 at 4). This statement is an indicator of financial stress. He admitted he was aware that \nhe owed the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a money, and relied on foreclosure to erase that debt, \nas it apparently erased the other approximately $45,000 debt he disclosed on his SF 86. \nUse of foreclosure to eliminate debt shows some financial irresponsibility and lack of \njudgment. Applicant learned of the security significance of his delinquent debt when he \nresponded to interrogatories, and this knowledge was reinforced when he received the \nSOR and FORM. His efforts to resolve his delinquent debt raise security concerns.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence of any \nsecurity violation. Aside from the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a (which is a civil, non-\ncriminal issue), he is a law-abiding citizen. His other debts are current. The overall \namount of his debt currently in litigation at about $28,000 is relatively low. Trial recently \noccurred, but the court\u2019s judgment was not provided. The Appeal Board has addressed \na key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can \nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts  simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. \nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually \npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the \nSOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant is a maintenance \nworker. He attended a community college, but did not graduate. He is not sophisticated \nin the areas of finance and real estate. He made mistakes, and lost money on an \ninvestment property. However, there is simply no reason not to trust his promise to pay \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He said he would set up a payment plan and pay any \nresulting judgment. His credit report (Item 5) shows that he has paid numerous debts \nover the years and only the two debts relating to the foreclosure stand out as being \ndelinquent. And of the two, the Veterans Administration mortgage was apparently \nresolved in the foreclosure. He has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \npayment sufficient to trust his promise to pay the sole SOR debt. These factors show \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has mitigated the personal conduct and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Her creditors refused to accept the small payments she was able \nto pay and routinely wanted her to pay half the balanced owed. In 2007, Applicant \nsought financial counseling. She initially considered filing bankruptcy, but established a \nrepayment plan. (Ex. G) The plan requires her to make $216 payments twice a month. \n(Tr. 25) The funds come directly from her checking accounts. Since starting the \nprogram, she has never been late on a payment. The original balance due on the \naccounts listed in the repayment agreement was $13,718. As of April 2009, she had \nmade payments of $6,338. \n \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n In October 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to question 28, which asked about her \nfinancial delinquencies, she listed a loan and taxes as being delinquent. Her taxes have \nsince been brought current and are not of concern in the SOR. She answered \u201cno\u201d \nwhen asked if she had ever been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt or was \ncurrently 90 days delinquent on any obligation. At the time Applicant completed her \nquestionnaire, she knew she had debts, but did not know how many days she was \ndelinquent.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant has a history of \nfinancial problems. Applicant had 18 accounts placed for collection, charged-off, or were \ndelinquent, totaling approximately $21,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant has paid three of the debts, two additional debts are duplicates, and \nshe has been repaying 12 debts in a structured repayment agreement since the fall of \n2007. Applicant is unable to locate the one remaining creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.m, $103). She \nentered into the repayment agreement in 2007 months before receiving the 2008 SOR. \nShe has never missed, or been late on, any of her payments to the repayment plan.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) apply. AG \u00b6 20(a) only partially applies \nbecause the accounts are numerous and the majority still being repaid. However, \nApplicant has paid a number of the debts and been making payments in accord with the \nrepayment agreement since the fall of 2007. Her action to repay her debts makes it \nunlikely additional delinquent debts would occur. \n \nApplicant had no financial problems until her divorce in 2000, which is an event \nbeyond her control. Her actions to repay the accounts show she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant has paid three of the 18 debts (two of which are \nduplicate debts) and has an agreement paying the $216 twice a month on 12 additional \ndebts. She has reduced her debt from almost $14,000 to approximately $7,700. She is \nliving within her means and paying her debts.  \n \nThe sole remaining $103 debt, for which she has been unsuccessful in locating \nthe creditor, does not raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe Government has shown Applicant's answers to questions 28.a and 28.b on \nher e-QIP were incorrect, but this does not prove Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose information about her finances. Applicant did list some adverse financial \ninformation in response to the questions. The Applicant denied any intentional \nfalsification. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any \nwritten document or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security \nclearance, is a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A \nfalsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed her e-QIP, she was aware she had debts; however, \nshe was unaware of the number and extent of her delinquent debts. It was not until she \nobtained a copy of her credit report that she learned the extent of her delinquent \naccounts. Having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and listened to her testimony, I find \nher answers were not deliberate omissions, concealments, or falsifications.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts in the SOR were not \nincurred on luxuries. The debts incurred were not the type that indicates poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Money was \nnot spent frivolously. Applicant drives a 1983 pickup and her husband drives a 1997 \npickup. She is not living beyond her financial means.  \n \nSince 2007, she has actively addressed her debts. All but one of the debts have \nbeen paid or are being paid. The sole remaining debt ($103) is so small that it is not of \nsecurity significance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.r:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

On August 19, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On\nJanuary 21, 2009, after the close of the record, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the issue of whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant had financial difficulties but that those problems had been\nmitigated under Guideline F.  Regarding Guideline E, the Judge found that Applicant intentionally\nfalsified his SF 86 when he failed to divulge his delinquent debts.  The Judge concluded that this\ndeliberate falsehood was not mitigated. \nApplicant argues that at no time during the entire process of application for a security\nclearance was the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept ever mentioned or discussed.  Applicant claims that if the\nwhole-person concept was used by the Judge \u201cto reach and base his decision\u201d regarding his personal\nconduct, then he has the right to appeal the decision.  Applicant also complains that DOHA never\nsought on its own, any favorable information regarding his character and integrity.  Applicant fails\nto demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nPrior to the submission of the case file to the Judge, Applicant received instructions regarding\nthe case.  He also received a copy of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6.  Paragraph 2(a) gives\na full and detailed description of the whole-person concept.  Applicant was therefore on notice as\nto the whole-person concept.  There is no right to any additional instruction or description from\nDOHA regarding the whole-person concept.  There is record evidence which suggests Applicant\nunderstood and relied upon the whole-person concept, namely, his response to the SOR in which he\ndiscussed his service history and his past protection of sensitive information.  He again submitted\nsuch material in response to the file of relevant material submitted by the government.  Moreover,\nApplicant has failed to articulate how he was prejudiced by the lack of any further description by\nDOHA of the whole-person concept.  Regarding the submission of favorable evidence, DOHA has\nno duty to present such evidence.  Rather, through the receipt of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Applicant was informed prior to the submission of the case file to the Judge of the\nrequirement to submit evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by Applicant\nor proven by Department Counsel.  Directive \u00b6E3.1.15.  As indicated earlier in this paragraph,\nApplicant did, in fact, avail himself of the opportunity to submit matters in his own behalf for the\n\n3\nJudge\u2019s consideration.  Applicant fails to articulate how he was denied due process or how any\nadditional initiatives on the part of DOHA would have prevented any supposed denial.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal submission contains documents of an evidentiary nature that were not\nmade part of the record below.  The Board cannot receive or consider new evidence submitted on\nappeal.  Directive, \u00b6E3.1.29.\nApplicant has failed to establish error below.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E, Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 7, 2009, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on November 5, 2009. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant did not object to the admission of the items attached to the \nFORM, and they are admitted. Applicant submitted a series of documents, which were \nmarked AE A through F and admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me \non January 7, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance. He held a clearance in the past, but it has lapsed. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, awarded in 1975. Applicant served on active duty as an officer in the \nUnited States Army from 1975 until he was honorably discharged in 1981. He served in \nthe inactive reserve from 1981 until 1989. He is a disabled veteran and receives \ndisability benefits. He married in 1976, and divorced in 1977. He married again in 1977, \nand is still married. He was separated for a number of years. His current status is \nunclear, but it appears he is separated. He has no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother had a stroke in 1993, followed by the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease. His father developed cancer in 1998, and he also eventually became afflicted \nwith Alzheimer\u2019s. He lived with his parents during this period and was their primary \ncaregiver. Applicant\u2019s and his parents\u2019 savings were depleted by the medical and other \nexpenses incidental to their care. Applicant applied for credit cards in his own name and \nalso co-signed for credit cards with his father. They used the cards until the cards \nreached their limit. They were unable to meet the payments, and several debts became \ndelinquent. By 1998, Applicant\u2019s mother required 24-hour care. They obtained \ncaregivers who worked 24 hours by shifts. Applicant moved in with his wife, who he had \nbeen separated from since 1985. He stated that the caregivers would not work the \nmidnight shift if he was living at his parents\u2019 home. He continued to spend a lot of time \nat his parents\u2019 house. His parents both passed away in 2005. His father was 89 when \nhe passed away, and his mother was 86 at the time of her death.2   \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts and an unpaid judgment. Applicant \nadmitted that at one point he owed the judgment for $24,507 and the delinquent debt of \n$19,815, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f, but he provided documentation that the \njudgment was satisfied in December 2008, and the delinquent debt was paid in \nSeptember 2009. He admitted owing the $11,610 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He stated \nthat he is in contact with the collection company handling this debt and \u201cwill be working \n                                                          \n1 Items 4, 5; AE A. \n \n2 Items 4-6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nout a payment arrangement with them to settle this debt.\u201d He denied owing the \nremaining three debts.3    \n \n \nThe debts that Applicant denied owing include a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.b-$6,169), a \ncollection company on behalf of the same bank (SOR \u00b6 1.c-$8,190), and another \nfinancial institution for a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.d-$11,671). The two bad debts to the \nsame bank alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are listed on a credit report obtained on April \n7, 2007. However, the entries indicate that the debts were purchased by another lender \nand show a zero balance. The credit report entry for the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt shows \nApplicant as an authorized user. The entry for the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt shows the debt as a \njoint account. The credit report also lists a separate entry for the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt as \ncollected by a collection company, with a balance of $8,190. The $11,671 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d is also listed on the 2007 credit report. It shows Applicant as an authorized \nuser. Applicant disputed these three debts claiming they were his father\u2019s debts. The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c do not appear on later credit reports. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is listed on credit reports obtained in May 2009.4      \n \n \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in May 2008. He included a \npersonal financial statement (PFS), which indicated he had a net monthly remainder \n(total net monthly income minus total net monthly expenses and debts) of minus $920. \nThe listed net monthly remainder was not accurate as Applicant\u2019s mortgage of $628 \nwas double counted under both monthly expenses and debts. Applicant stated that the \nPFS is no longer accurate. He stated in his response to the SOR that his net monthly \nremainder at that time was a positive $1,500, \u201cwhich would provide for monthly \npayments on any remaining delinquent debts.\u201d5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMarch 2007.  He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 27d, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have \nyou had any judgments against you that have not been paid?\u201d He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to \nQuestions 28a and 28b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d6  \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He stated that he was \nunaware that a judgment was entered against him. Because he was not living at his \nfather\u2019s home, he did not always receive mail that was sent there. He stated that the \ndefault judgment to a collection company on behalf of a bank was entered against him \nin 2002.7 It is feasible that Applicant was unaware of the judgment. I find there is \n                                                          \n3 Item 4; AE A-D. \n \n4 Items 4, 5-9; AE A. \n \n5 Items 4, 6. \n \n6 Item 5. \n \n7 Items 4, 6; AE A. \n\n \n4 \n \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant intentionally falsified the question \nabout unpaid judgments. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the answers to Questions 28a and 28b were incorrect, \nbut he denied that they were intentionally false: \n \nIn the past, when I filled out and completed written SF-85 and SF-86 \nForms or other forms of security clearance applications for several job \npositions with other government contractors, some had asked for \ninformation only for the last 7 years on active accounts. That is why I had \nanswered \u201cNO\u201d to several questions concerning my finances. I was \nassuming that the information being asked about was regarding current \nactive accounts and not ones that were inactive or in collections.8 \n \nAfter considering all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, education, and experience, \nas well as the questions themselves, I did not find Applicant\u2019s explanations to be \nplausible. I find that he intentionally provided false answers to Questions 28a and 28b. \n \n \nApplicant left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct in \n2006. He used the company\u2019s information technology (IT) resources for personal use. \nHe indicated that he had difficulty concentrating and maintaining focus at work because \nof the impact his parents\u2019 deaths and the suicide of a co-worker had on him. He \nreceived counseling which helped him cope with his grief issues. There is no indication \nof any other similar conduct.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n8 Item 4. \n \n9 Items 4, 6; AE A. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant satisfied the $24,507 judgment in December 2008, and the $19,815 \ndelinquent debt was paid in September 2009. He has not resolved another debt for \nmore than $11,000. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant was the primary caregiver for two elderly, sick parents before they \npassed away in 2005. He incurred a number of debts to help pay for their care. Those \nare conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also \nrequires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant was \nclearly responsible for two debts and a judgment, totaling $55,993. He paid the two \nlargest debts, totaling $44,322. He is in contact with the collection company handling \nthe $11,671 debt, and intends to work out a payment arrangement with them to settle \nthe debt. I find that Applicant acted responsibly and initiated a good-faith effort to repay \n\n \n7 \n \nhis overdue creditors. There are clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are applicable. \n \n \nApplicant disputed owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. The \n2007 credit report does not list a balance due for the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt, and it lists \nApplicant as an authorized user on the account. The debt does not appear on any credit \nreports after 2007. The SOR \u00b6 1.c debt does not appear on any credit reports after \n2007. The 2007 credit report lists Applicant as an authorized user on the SOR \u00b6 1.d \naccount. Applicant established that he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those \ndebts.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant left a job by mutual agreement in 2006, after he used the company\u2019s IT \nresources for personal use. That behavior, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nand \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable. It is also \nconduct that could create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 \n16(e) is applicable. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in March 2007, when he failed to \ndivulge his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable as a disqualifying condition. There \nis insufficient evidence for a determination that he intentionally falsified the question \nabout unpaid judgments. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant admittedly used his company\u2019s IT resources for personal use. That \nbehavior happened in 2006, shortly after he lost his parents and the death of a co-\nworker by suicide. Applicant received counseling. There is no evidence of any similar \nincidents. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are applicable to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.c.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant has denied falsifying his SF 86. Those denials are not credible and are \nadditional false statements. I find that no mitigating conditions are applicable to the \nintentional falsification of his SF 86.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. I \nhave considered Applicant\u2019s service to this country as an Army officer and as a DoD \ncontractor. His financial difficulties were related to his caring for his ill parents until they \ndied. Those concerns are mitigated. He intentionally provided false information about \nhis financial problems on his SF 86. Those concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Financial Considerations concerns, but has not mitigated \nPersonal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since about September 2007. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1980 to 1993, and was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant (E-5). He earned a degree from a technical institute in 1997. Applicant was married in 1979, and divorced in 1985. He married again in 1985, separated in about 2005, and divorced in July 2008. He recently remarried his first wife.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 4, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on August 21, 2008, and reassigned to me on September 16, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 4, 2008. I convened the hearing \nOctober 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nas scheduled on September 24, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf but did \nnot submit any documentary evidence. The record was held open until October 10, \n2008, for Applicant to submit documentary evidence if he desired to do so. Applicant did \nnot submit any documentary evidence, as verified by Department Counsel\u2019s e-mail, \nwhich is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on October 8, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since about September 2007. He served in the U.S. Air Force from \n1980 to 1993, and was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant (E-5). He earned a \ndegree from a technical institute in 1997. Applicant was married in 1979, and divorced \nin 1985. He married again in 1985, separated in about 2005, and divorced in July 2008. \nHe recently remarried his first wife. He has three adult children living on their own and \ntwo stepchildren, ages 17 and 14, living with him and his wife. He also has a younger \nstepchild who is living with the child\u2019s father.1  \n \n \nThe SOR lists 12 debts totaling approximately $19,890. Applicant admitted to \nowing all the debts in the SOR with the exception of \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e, 1.h, and 1.k, \nwhich he denied. He admitted owing seven debts totaling approximately $10,492. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment, under-employment, \nand low-paying jobs after losing a good-paying job in 2002. He stated he has been \nsupporting his current wife and family since 2005, because they were victims of \ndomestic violence.2 He also stated he was the victim of identity theft by his second wife. \nOn April 11, 2008, Applicant filed a police report in the state where he lives, accusing \nhis second wife of identity theft. He wrote: \n \nRecently became aware that my ex-wife has opened multiple credit \naccounts and had no authorization from me to do so. She has signed my \nname & used my statistics. Additionally, several of said accounts were \ndischarged after she initiated Chapter 13 [bankruptcy] in both of our \nnames well after we were separated in 2004.3 \n \nApplicant was separated but not divorced from his second wife at the time of the police \nreport. He reported that the identity theft occurred in a different state than where he was \nliving at that time. He has never heard back from the police department about the \nreport. Applicant completed an ID Theft Affidavit on May 6, 2008, stating \u201cI believe my \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 12, 15, 23-24, 42-43; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 12-13; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n3 GE 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nestranged wife used my name, SSN # & signature without my knowledge or approval for \nseveral years during our marriage.\u201d4 \n \n \nThe debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j are medical debts totaling about $1,341. \nApplicant admitted responsibility for these debts. Most of the medical bills are the result \nof an emergency medical procedure when Applicant was unemployed and uninsured.5 \n \n \nIn his response to interrogatories in May 2008, Applicant stated that he had no \nknowledge of a debt of $723 to a jewelry store. He wrote that he believed his \u201cestranged \nwife opened this account without [his] knowledge or consent-using [his] name, SSN, \nand signature.\u201d This debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He admitted at the hearing that after \ninvestigating this debt, he discovered that it is a joint debt and he is responsible for the \ndebt.6 \n \n \nApplicant initially denied owing a debt of $6,721 to a collection company on the \ndeficiency owed on a car loan after the car was involved in an accident, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. He claimed no knowledge of this debt in his response to interrogatories. At \nthe hearing Applicant admitted that he and his ex-wife were living together when the car \nwas purchased and he co-signed for the loan for this car.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e lists a debt of $702 to a collection company on behalf of a women\u2019s \nfitness center. Applicant denied owing this debt. The credit report of September 29, \n2007, lists $702 as the high credit of this debt, but does not list a balance. The June 24, \n2008 credit report does not list the debt. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that \nApplicant is responsible for this debt.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $8,976, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, for the \ndeficiency balance owed on a car loan after the vehicle was repossessed and sold at \nauction.9 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $352 to a collection company on behalf of a \ncellular telephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Applicant formally \ndisputed this debt with the collection agency which responded with a letter dated April \n14, 2008, asking Applicant for an official police report and a signed and notarized \nAffidavit of Fraud, which was enclosed. This is apparently the ID Theft Affidavit \ndiscussed above. This account was opened in September 2001, and became \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 24-25; GE 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 28, 35-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n6 Tr. at 28-29; GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. at 30-33; GE 2-4. \n \n8 Tr. at 33-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n9 Tr. at 34-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \ndelinquent in February 2002, years before Applicant became separated and divorced \nfrom his ex-wife.10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k lists a debt of $900 to a collection company on behalf of the same \njewelry store as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant denied owing this debt. The June 24, \n2008 credit report does not list the debt. This debt appears to be a duplicate of the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that there were two debts to the \njewelry store. Applicant admitted owing the debt of $175 to a bank, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.l.11 \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payments on any of the debts in the SOR. Applicant \nhas been paying on a delinquent student loan. His scheduled monthly payments were \n$280. The Department of Education has obtained funds from Applicant\u2019s income tax \nrefund for 2007, and his economic stimulus payment, for the delinquent student loan. \nThe student loan debt in February 2008 was about $13,000. It is down to about $1,600, \nmostly resulting from the seizure of the tax refund and stimulus payment. He now pays \n$177 per month. The IRS also seized part of his tax refund for unpaid taxes from tax \nyear 2002. Applicant stated that he would like to pay his delinquent debts as soon as \npossible.12 \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He saw an attorney who advised \nhim to contact the credit reporting agencies and obtain an updated report and then go \nthrough the report and contact each creditor to dispute the debts.13 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement dated May 6, 2008, in his \nresponse to interrogatories. It listed a net monthly remainder of $1 without payment of \ndelinquent debts. It did not include overtime pay and it did not reflect the reduction in \npayments on the student loan from $280 to $177.14 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 36-37, 41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n11 Tr. at 38-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n12 Tr. at 13-19, 26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. The student loan and tax debts were not \nalleged in the SOR and are not considered for disqualifying purposes. They are considered for the \npurposes of mitigation and under the whole person.  \n \n13 Tr. at 40.  \n \n14 Tr. at 26-27; GE 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a finding that the indebtedness was caused by \nfrivolous or irresponsible spending or that Applicant consistently spent beyond his \nmeans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and (d) are not applicable.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that his personal financial statement shows a net monthly \nremainder of $1 without payment of delinquent debts. That personal financial statement \ndid not include overtime pay and it did not reflect the reduction in payments on the \nstudent loan from $280 to $177. It does not raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.m is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payments on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. He attributed his financial problems to unemployment, \nunder-employment, and low-paying jobs after losing a good-paying job in 2002. He also \nhad an emergency medical procedure while he was unemployed and did not have \nmedical insurance. These are conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be \nfully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has not made any effort to pay any of the debts alleged in the \nSOR. There is insufficient information for a finding that he has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. His limited advice from the \nattorney does not qualify as counseling under AG \u00b6 20(c). There are not clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \napplicable. Applicant has made payments on his delinquent student loans. That is \ninsufficient to warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(d) as a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant initially disputed owing several debts, claiming he had no knowledge of \nthe debts. He later admitted that the debts were accrued by his ex-wife while they were \nstill married and living together. He admitted that he co-signed on the largest disputed \ndebt for the car loan. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice to our country and that he was honorably discharged from the Air Force. \nHowever, his finances have been in bad shape for a number of years with no sign of \nimprovement in the foreseeable future. They remain a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

On December 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 22, 2008. She\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nFebruary 10, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 18, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 19, 2009. The Government offered\nExhibits (Ex.) 1-7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified in her own\nbehalf and presented the testimony of one witness. She submitted Exhibits (AE) A-G\nApril 8, 2009\n\n2\nwhich were admitted into the record. I held the record open until April 3, 2009, for any\ndocuments that Applicant wished to submit. Applicant timely submitted three\ndocuments, which were marked as (AE) H, I, and J. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on March 27, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k of the SOR. She provided additional information\nto support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1993 and attended college for approximately one year. She has worked\nfor her current employer since February 19, 2007 (GE 1). She held a security clearance\nfrom 2001 until the recent revocation.\nApplicant was in relationship from approximately November 1993 until 1998. As a\nresult of that relationship, she had two children. The father of Applicant\u2019s children left in\n1998 and has not provided any financial support. During those years, Applicant worked\nas much as she could and supported her children (Tr. 17). Applicant used her credit to\nfinance everything. Her boyfriend used her credit as well but he did not pay any of the\nbills. Applicant was faced with overwhelming debt. She filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in\nMarch 1999. The bankruptcy was discharged on June 24, 1999 (GE 7).\nApplicant moved in with her family at that time. In 2002, Applicant married. She\nand her husband purchased a home in a neighborhood that was safe for their children.\nShe believes they may have lived above their means (Tr. 20).   \nIn 2003, Applicant left her job partly because she was pregnant. She was\nunemployed from 2003 until 2006. She attempted to do some consulting work and some\ntemporary jobs. Applicant was not making very much money. She and her husband\nwere falling behind in their payments and could not keep up with their expenses.\nIn 2005, Applicant was expecting another child. She started a full time position\nuntil the birth of her child in 2006. She attempted part time employment a few days a\nweek but she could not afford child care. She did not work outside the home at that\ntime. \nApplicant and her husband did not ignore the ever increasing debt situation. They\ntried to provide for their family and manage the debts. Applicant and her husband have\nfive children. They moved in with friends and withdrew funds from a retirement fund.\nThey developed a budget. They contacted their creditors and researched the debts. \n\n3\nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent debts, including four judgments and credit card\nbills. The total amount of delinquent debt was approximately $25,000 (GE 3). Applicant\ndocumented that some of the accounts listed on the SOR for Capitol One are duplicated\nas judgments. Applicant produced documentation that the judgments for Capitol One\nalleged in the SOR have been satisfied (AE H)\nApplicant discussed her financial status with her father in late 2008. She was\nconcerned about the financial considerations security concerns. Her parents decided\nthat they would give their daughter a gift of approximately $18,000 (AE C ) so that she\ncould pay her debts (Tr. 22). Applicant settled the debts alleged in the SOR. She and\nher husband have moved to a smaller home in the same neighborhood (Tr. 23). She\nhas a payment plan for Dominion Power (AE G) Applicant submitted documentation that\nAT&T and Verizon have been paid (AE D).\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $5,025. She is current on her daily\nexpenses. After her monthly expenses, she has a net remainder of $500 (GE 6). She no\nlonger uses credit cards (Tr 62). Applicant enrolled in a class, \u201cSmart Money\nManagement\u201d designed to address her goals for savings and budgeting (AE J). She has\nregistered for a \u201cFinancial Assessment\u201d class and a \u201cHome Ownership\u201d seminar through\na state university.\nApplicant\u2019s employer rates her as superior in her job performance. This is the\nhighest rating. She conducts herself in a professional manner and is respectful. She is a\nteam player who maintains a good attitude. She is being promoted based on\nperformance rating (AE I ).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts. She\nadmits that she did not meet her financial obligations from 1999 and filed for bankruptcy\n\n5\nwhich was discharged in June 1999. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in approximately 1999. The father of her two children did not\nprovide for them financially. She worked as much as she could but could not keep\npaying all the bills. He used her credit. She married in 2002 and she and her current\nhusband incurred more delinquent debt due in part to her unemployment. She had\napproximately $25,000 in delinquent debt. This potentially mitigating condition does not\napply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant had two children to support for many years as a single parent. She had a\nperiod of unemployment from 2003 until approximately 2006. Applicant\u2019s situation may\nhave started due to underemployment after her separation, and may have initially\nstarted a downturn for her. It did impact on her ability to pay other debts. She also\nrelated that she and her husband overextended themselves. After she became gainfully\nemployed, she acted as responsibly as she could have in identifying and resolving these\ndebts. She admits making poor financial decisions. I find this mitigating condition\npartially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant registered for counseling (AE J ). She now has a\nbudget. She has resolved all of her accounts. She has made good-faith efforts to repay\nher creditors and never ignored the issue. I conclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\n\n6\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nApplicant has a very good work record. She has held a security clearance since\n2001. Her current employer rates her highly. She has supported her children and\nworked hard to manage her bills.\nShe did not receive any financial support from the father of her first two children.\nHe used her credit and did not pay any bills. Applicant worked as hard as she could but\nwas unemployed for a period of time. She filed for bankruptcy in 1999 which is a legal\nmeans to resolve debt.\nApplicant is now married and has five children. She and her husband are both\nworking. She received a gift from her father to pay her delinquent debts. She is mindful\nof her financial responsibilities. She is now in a better position to remain on a sound\nfinancial track. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under the financial\nconsiderations guideline.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-k:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 9, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn July 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 26, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 10, 2008. Applicant did not file\na response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on November 14, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 65 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nSOR Allegation 1.a: Applicant is indebted to the State of California in the\napproximate amount of $1,012.00 as evidenced by a State tax lien filed against him in\n1996 (Exhibit 7). As of September 2008, this lien was still in place (Exhibit 8).\nSOR Allegation 1.b: Applicant is indebted to the State of California in the\napproximate amount of $8,164.00 as evidenced by a State tax lien filed against him in\n1995 (Exhibit 7). As of September 2008, this lien was still in place (Exhibit 8).\nSOR Allegation 1.c: Applicant was indebted to the IRS in the approximate\namount of $4,854.00. Because the only evidence of this debt was a tax lien filed against\nhim in 1994, and Exhibit 7 indicates the lien was released in 2003, I find applicant is no\nlonger indebted to the IRS.\nSOR Allegation 1.d: Applicant admits he is indebted to Applied Credit Bank in\nthe approximate amount of $2,835.00. This credit card debt has been delinquent since\nat least 2002, and was placed for collection. In his response to the SOR, applicant\nstated he is \u201cpresently negotiating with them for a final settlement.\u201d\nSOR Allegation 1.e: Applicant was indebted to Providian on an account that\nwent delinquent and was placed for collection with Palisades Collection in the\napproximate amount of $4,500.00. Applicant settled the debt for $2,375.00 and made\nthe $2,375.00 payment in August 2008.\nSOR Allegation 1.f: Applicant is indebted to Verizon Wireless on an account that\nwent delinquent and was referred to Pinnacle Credit for collection in the approximate\namount of $1,364.00.\nSOR Allegation 1.g: Applicant was indebted to AT&T on an account that went\ndelinquent and was turned over to NCO Financial for collection in the approximate\namount of $455.00. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated \u201cthe AT&T bill has\nbeen paid in full, for the original amount, documentation included.\u201d He attached a copy\nof a receipt from AT&T, dated August 26, 2008, which shows a payment of $385.62.\nAlthough this appears to be the original amount of the debt, there is no evidence that\nAT&T accepted this payment as payment in full.\nIn Exhibit 6, applicant provided a number of reasons for his financial\ndelinquencies. He claims the tax liens were the result of incorrect tax forms being filed\nby others. He claims he does not owe the taxes, and will not pay them. (He didn\u2019t offer\nan explanation for the release of the IRS lien). He also stated that his financial problems\nwere caused by a break up with his girlfriend, two major vehicle accidents, problems\nwith the freight hauling business, and an illness, which caused him to lose \u201ca lot of time\nin the office.\u201d \n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\n\n4\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of conduct\nindicating an inability or unwillingness to pay his debts.  Accordingly, these disqualifying\nconditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are\nrecent and ongoing. The evidence he offered is insufficient to establish he is unlikely to\nexperience further financial delinquencies. This mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nprovided numerous reasons for his financial problems. However, he failed to offer\nsufficient details to permit a finding that these reasons were the primary factors behind\nhis numerous financial delinquencies, or that he acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. The problem is not under control, as\nevidenced by applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to address the State tax debts and\nthe Verizon debt, and to reach an agreement with Applied Credit Bank on repaying this\nsix year old debt. This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant\nsatisfied the Providian debt, and either satisfied or made a substantial payment on the\nAT&T debt. These are factors in his favor. However, given the facts that (1) these\npayments were made after he received the SOR, (2) he has not made any payment to\nor payment arrangements with Applied Credit Bank or Verizon Wireless, and (3) he has\nnot provided credible evidence that he has recently tried to resolve his tax debts, he has\nnot \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nThis mitigating condition is not applicable.\nParagraph 20.e. applies when \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d This mitigating condition does not apply because, although\napplicant may have a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of his tax debts, he\nprovided no documentation to substantiate his position.\n\n5\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who fell\nbehind on numerous debts many years ago, and some of these debts are still\noutstanding. Applicant claims his tax debts are not legitimate and some of his other\nfinancial delinquencies were caused by factors beyond his control. Although possibly\ntrue, the evidence he offered to support these claims; namely, uncorroborated written\nstatements, is insufficient to establish their validity. Had applicant requested a hearing\ninstead of a decision based on the written record, he may have been able to offer\nadditional evidence clarifying some matters (e.g., why the IRS lien was released; how\nexactly his break up, accidents, and illness impacted his income) which - together with\nhis written statements - may have been sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBut applicant did not request a hearing, and based on the limited evidence in the record,\nI have no choice but to conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns\narising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

A subsequent background investigation confirmed that Applicant had \nthe following  delinquent accounts:  a $1,045 account that was placed for collection in \n2003 which was related to the early termination of a lease (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1 at 40; Gov \n2 at 6; Gov 3 at 1); a $1,538 pay day loan placed for collection in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov \n1 at 42; Gov 2 at 21; Gov 3); a $336 credit card account that was charged off in 2007   \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 2.); a $503 credit card account that was charged off in 2007 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d; Gov 3 at 2); a $571 credit card account that was charged off in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e; Gov 3 at 2); a $50 medical account that was placed for collection in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f: Gov 1 at 38-39; Gov 2 at 14); and a $668 medical account placed for collection in        \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 1 at 39-40; Gov 2 at 20-21; Gov 3 at 1). \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $599 phone account that was placed for \ncollection in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 1 at 40-41; Gov 2 at 6); a $116 phone account that \nwas placed for collection in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 1 at 41; Gov 2 at 7); a $50 medical \naccount that was placed for collection in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.j; Gov 1 at 41; Gov 2 at 15-\n16,21); a $1,276 credit card account that was placed for collection in 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: \nGov 1 at 42; Gov 2 at 4-5); a $52 medical account that was placed for collection in 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 1 at 43; Gov 2 at 16; Gov 3 at 1); and a $50 medical account that was \nplaced for collection in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 1 at 43; Gov 2 at 21). \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include; a $1,500 computer account placed for \ncollection in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 1 at 44); a $75 medical account that was placed for \ncollection in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 1 at 44; Gov 2 at 22; Gov 3 at 1); a $3,115 \ndelinquent line of credit opened in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 1 at 45; Gov 2 at 21); a $2,144 \ndelinquent account opened in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov 1 at 45; Gov 2 at 21);  a $651 \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndepartment store account placed for collection in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.r: Gov 1 at 46; Gov 2 \nat 22); and a $446 department store account that was placed for collection in 2001 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 1 at 46; Gov 2 at 22.).  \n \nApplicant incurred most of her debts when she was in college. Although she \nworked several jobs while attending college, she relied on credit cards for living \nexpenses. She became pregnant during her second year in college. After she had the \nbaby, she continued to work and go to school full-time. In November 2004, she moved \nback into her father\u2019s house. Her father helped her get back on her feet. She continued \nto attend classes and work. She began to work on her financial obligations in \nSeptember 2007. (Tr at 25-26.)  \n \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows: \n \nApplicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant leased a townhome \nin 2003 while she was in college. The townhome had several problems including bug \ninfestations, and a broken washer and dryer. The landlord did not take action to repair \nthe property so Applicant moved out prior to the termination of her lease. The landlord \nkept her security deposit. She formally disputed the debt with the credit reporting \nagency. (Tr at 27-30; Gov 3 at 1.) I find for Applicant pertaining to this debt. She has \ntaken sufficient steps to resolve this account and appears to have a legitimate dispute. \n \nApplicant has paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f (AE A); 1.g (AE B; AE C); 1.j, \nAE D); 1.l (AE E); 1.m (AE F); and 1.o (AE G).  Each of these accounts were medical \nbills or medical insurance co-pays incurred when Applicant was away at college. The \nbills were sent to her father\u2019s home and she assumed that her father paid them. (Tr at \n35-38, 60.) \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant consulted a credit counselor to establish a plan to resolve \nher debts and to learn how to establish a budget and manage her expenses. The credit \ncounselor advised her to enter into repayment plans with five of her creditors at a time \nbased on what she could afford to pay. They advised her which creditors to choose first. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k are included in her repayment \nplan. The first payment was due on September 22, 2008. The monthly payment of $171 \ncomes directly out of her bank account. (Tr at 24, 34, 38, 41, 56-58; AE J.) \n \nThe $1,538 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was a pay day loan. The original amount \nof the loan was $500. Applicant attempted to set up a payment plan with the company \nbut they would not agree to a payment plan. (Tr at 31-32.) The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r and 1.s remain unresolved. Applicant intends to arrange payment \nplans with these creditors after she completes her payment plans with the first five debts \nin her payment plan.  She claims she has never had an account with the creditor  \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q. (Tr at 34-35, 42-49.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has a total of $60,000 worth of student loans which are currently in \ndeferment. She anticipates her monthly student loan payments will be approximately \n$280 per month. (Tr at 52-53.) She has no open credit card accounts. (Tr at 56.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $1,694. In addition to her full-time job, she \nworks part-time as a customer service specialist at a department store. She receives \n$472 in monthly child support. Her total monthly income is $2,166. She lives with her \nfather and pays no rent. Day care costs $600 per month. Her car payment is $334. Her \ncar insurance is $111. She pays $200 per month in fuel and $100 per month in tolls. \nHealth insurance is $336 per month. Food is approximately $100 per month. Personal \ncare costs about $39 per month. Her monthly debt counseling payment is $171. Her \ntotal monthly costs are $1,981. After expenses, she has approximately $185 left over \neach month. (AE K.) \n \nNow that she has her Masters Degree, Applicant hopes to find a better paying \njob. In her spare time, she volunteers in the community and her church. She is also \ntaking classes in pursuit of an MBA degree. (Tr at 60-61, 65.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s father testified on her behalf. He states that she has always been \nheadstrong and conscientious.  When she went away to college, she was somewhat \nna\u00efve and became overextended in credit cards. Even though she became pregnant \nduring her sophomore year in college, she was determined to finish school.  She would \nattend classes and work several jobs to make ends meet. He convinced her to move \nhome so she could get a little help with her daughter.  He is proud that his daughter was \nable to achieve her undergraduate and graduate degrees. He is not proud of her \nfinancial situation but supports her and stands behind her.  She is a very conscientious \noutstanding member of the community. (Tr at 63-66.) \n \nThe Senior Staffing Supervisor of Applicant\u2019s company states Applicant is \nefficient, organized, and willing to complete necessary tasks. She receives great \nfeedback in the quality and quantity of work that she provides. She recommends her for \na security clearance. (AE H.) The Operations Manager states Applicant is \nadministratively solid and dependable. She is comfortable both working on her own and \nin a team environment. She can handle any challenging career with an opportunity for \nadvancement based on her personality, education, and professional attitude. (AE I) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant has accumulated a significant \namount of delinquent debt since 2001. The SOR alleges 19 debts, an approximate total \nbalance of $14,785.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While most of the \ndebts were incurred several years ago when Applicant was away at college, the majority \nof the delinquent accounts remain unresolved. While Applicant resolved the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o, the total amount of the resolved debt is \n$945.  More than $13,000 of unresolved debt remains. Applicant recently established a \nplan to resolve the remaining debt but it is too soon to conclude that her financial \nproblems will not recur.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.  Applicant incurred most of her \ndebt while a college student and as a single mother. While college students struggle to \npay expenses while attending classes, it is even more difficult to juggle the \nresponsibilities of attending class and supporting a child. Applicant worked several jobs \nin order to support her child and to attain her goal of completing her college education. \nShe eventually decided to move home to save on expenses which allowed her to \ncomplete her undergraduate and Masters Degrees. Most of the debts appear to be \nrelated to living expenses as opposed to a lavish lifestyle. Currently, Applicant works a \nfull-time job and a part-time job in order to meet expenses. While she remains in debt, \nshe has acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies, in part. Applicant attended financial counseling in May 2008. She has \nestablished a budget and entered into a repayment plan with five of the creditors.  This \nis what she can afford to pay based on her budget. She intends to resolve the remaining \ndebts after the first five debts are resolved. Applicant is given credit for having a plan to \nresolve her debts. However, considering the extent of the debt it will take some time for \nthe delinquent debts to be resolved.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant resolved six of the debts and \nhas entered into a repayment agreement with five other creditors though her consumer \ncredit counseling plan. While Applicant has six debts that have not been resolved, she \nhas taken the maximum action within her means to resolve her delinquent accounts. In \naddition to her full-time job, she has a part-time job. She lives with her father in order to \nreduce expenses. Upon being awarded a Master\u2019s Degree in August 2008, it is likely \nthat her income will increase if she finds a new job. Applicant initiated a good-faith effort \nto resolve her delinquent accounts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s superiors and her father. I considered that Applicant\u2019s financial \nstruggles as a single mother and full-time student. Applicant reduced her expenses by \nliving at home. She works a full-time and a part-time job. Despite the obstacles facing \nher, she achieved her goal of graduating from college. As soon as she was capable, \nshe established a plan to pay her delinquent accounts. She resolved six of the debts. \nShe is in a repayment plan with five of the debts and intends to resolve the remaining \ndebts in the future. While a promise to pay in the future is ordinarily not considered \nsufficient mitigation under financial considerations, the facts of this case are unique. \nApplicant has taken action to resolve the majority of her delinquent accounts. Her \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbudget indicates that she does not live a lavish lifestyle. She should be given credit for \ncompleting her Master\u2019s Degree which may have prevented her from resolving some of \nher delinquent accounts sooner but will likely improve her financial situation in the long \nterm future. \n \nAll of these factors indicate Applicant does not have poor self control, lacks \njudgment, or is unable to abide by rules and regulations. Her actions do establish that \nshe is reliable, trustworthy, and will protect classified information. There is no risk that \nshe will have to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. She has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He made sufficient \nprogress resolving his SOR debts to mitigate security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 5, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn May 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 8). On May 6, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On May 7, 2009, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me. On June 5, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on \nJuly 8, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 24-25), and Applicant offered six exhibits (Tr. 37-38, 48-49, 56, 62, 116-\n118; AE A-F). Applicant objected to the government\u2019s credit report, dated February 19, \n2009, because he believed his credit report, dated June 23, 2009, should be used \nbecause it is more recent (Tr. 25-26; GE 3). There were no other objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 26-27), and AE A-F (Tr. 38, 49, 56, 62, 122). Additionally, I \nadmitted documents addressing jurisdiction, Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to \nthe SOR (GE 5-8). After the hearing, Applicant provided eight exhibits (AE G-N). \nDepartment Counsel did not object and I admitted the eight exhibits (AE G-N). I \nreceived the transcript on July 15, 2009. I closed the record on July 23, 2009 (Tr. 115).      \n   \nProcedural issue \n \n \nOn June 22, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was cancelled because Applicant\u2019s \nsponsorship was lost (Tr. 15; GE 5). I rescheduled his hearing after DOHA established \na different defense contractor was sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance (Tr. 15-\n19; GE 5). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the SOR debts with \nexplanations (GE 8). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 29). He works \nas a logistics research analyst (Tr. 23, 29). In 1993, he received his graduate \nequivalency diploma (GED) (Tr. 6, 31). He has completed two years towards his \nbachelor of arts degree with a major in criminal justice (Tr. 6, 31). He anticipates \nreceiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 (Tr. 31). He served on active duty in the Army \nfor 11 years and left active duty as a sergeant (E-5) (Tr. 7). His military occupational \nspecialty in the Army was logistics (Tr. 7). He has held a Secret security clearance for \nabout 13 years (Tr. 34). He currently holds a Secret security clearance (Tr. 7, 34). He \nhas never had a security incident (Tr. 34). \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant has been married for 13 years (Tr. 29). He has three children, ages \nnine, 11 and 14 (Tr. 29). The two youngest children live with Applicant and his spouse \n(Tr. 30). He pays child support for his eldest child (Tr. 30). He separated from his \nspouse from 2001 to 2003 (Tr. 22, 69). The Army deployed him to Iraq from March 2003 \nto August 2003 (Tr. 22). The Army returned him early from Iraq because he had a \nmedical problem (Tr. 22). In 2001 to 2003, creditors repossessed two of the family cars, \nand some other bills fell behind because Applicant and his spouse were disputing who \nshould pay their debts (Tr. 22, 47). In August 2004, he received a medical retirement \nfrom the Army (Tr. 22, 32). He received $39,000 in medical severance pay (Tr. 119). \nAfter leaving active duty, he was unemployed for about two months (Tr. 23, 102). He \nreceived unemployment compensation of $224 a week (Tr. 32, 102).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was in the Army for ten years (Tr. 120). In 2004, she left active \nduty as a sergeant (E-5)(Tr. 120). She was handling the family bills and debts. She has \nbeen employed with a federal government agency since 2004 (Tr. 119). She has about \n$10,000 in her 401K account (Tr. 92; GE 2 at 7). She has about three credit cards (Tr. \n95). \n \nSummary of SOR debts \n \nApplicant disclosed his delinquent SOR debts on his March 5, 2007, SF-86 (Tr. \n105; GE 1). He obtained a credit report before he completed his SF-86 to ensure he \nprovided accurate information to the government (Tr. 105). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,705)\u2014Payment Plan. In March 2006, Applicant began making \npayments and in 2007, he increased the amount of his monthly payment to $350 (Tr. \n38-39). On April 2, 2009, the creditor wrote that Applicant owes $5,373, and the creditor \nhad received $6,972 in payments (AE A). On July 8, 2009, the creditor said the balance \nowed is $4,356, and the creditor had received $8,021 in payments (AE J). He plans to \ncontinue making payments on this debt (Tr. 35-41).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($485)\u2014Paid. The debt was owed to a landlord for breaking a lease \n(Tr. 48). On March 23, 2009, the creditor provided a letter indicating Applicant settled \nthis debt ($1,684) for $1,348 and paid it (Tr. 49-55; AE B). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($7,018)\u2014Paid. On May 19, 2009, Applicant paid $6,157, resolving \nthis debt (Tr. 57-61; AE C). He used his income tax refund from 2008 to pay this debt \n(Tr. 57). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($291)\u2014Paid. On May 18, 2009, Applicant settled and paid this credit \ncard debt (Tr. 62-66; AE D).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($9,987)\u2014Payment Plan. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s car payment was $554 a \nmonth (Tr. 69). It was repossessed in 2002 (Tr. 68).  His wife said she made sporadic \npayments in 2005 and 2006 (Tr. 67-68). Applicant and his spouse currently owe the \ncreditor $10,608 (AE K). They have a payment arrangement for $295 a month for three \nyears, starting on July 24, 2009 (AE K). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nIn addition to the SOR debts, a judgment was obtained for $1,016 on a dental \ndebt (Tr. 71). He thought his wife\u2019s dental insurance was going to pay the debt (Tr. 73). \nIn November 2008, they started making payments (Tr. 74), and in July 2009, Applicant \npaid the last $100 on this judgment (Tr. 71-77).  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross salary is about $6,000 (Tr. 77). He changed jobs \nseveral times in the last five years (Tr. 98-102). His annual salary has varied from about \n$35,000 to about $72,000 (Tr. 98-102). His current net monthly salary is about $4,600 \n(Tr. 78). His spouse\u2019s net take home pay is about $3,500 (Tr. 78). His monthly \nexpenses are: groceries ($300); clothing ($100); utilities ($400); telephone ($100); car \nexpenses ($220); car payment ($630); mortgage ($2,417); medical expenses ($50); \nchild support ($300); jewelry credit card ($40); and miscellaneous ($100) (Tr. 78-86, \n107; GE 2 at 7). His budget listed monthly payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n(monthly payment: $350), the judgment for the dental bill (monthly payment: $200), and \ntwo small charge card debts, totaling about $2,400 (monthly payment: $104) (Tr. 87-90; \nGE 2 at 7). He has about $3,800 monthly left after paying his expenses (Tr. 90-91). He \nhas about $1,100 in checking and savings (Tr. 92).  \n \nOn July 16, 2009, Applicant and his spouse received financial counseling (AE L-\nM). On July 21, 2009, they completed a detailed budget (AE N). The total of all credit \ncard debt is $4,656 (AE N). This includes six credit cards, and the minimum total \npayment for the six accounts is $156 (AE N). The monthly remainder after paying debts \n(including payments on two remaining SOR debts) and all expenses is $863 (AE N). \n \nApplicant\u2019s DD Form 214 shows: Army Achievement Medal (2nd Award); Army \nSuperior Unit Award; Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal; Army Good Conduct Medal (3rd Award); National Defense \nService Medal (2nd Award); Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; Armed Forces Service \nMedal; Noncommissioned Officer\u2019s Professional Development Ribbon; Army Service \nRibbon; Overseas Service Ribbon (2nd Award); United Nations Medal; and NATO Medal \n(AE F). His DD Form 214 notes his service in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom from March 2003 to August 2003 as well as completion of various military \ncourses and training (AE F).   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nconcerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are \nof security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his SF-\n86, his SOR response and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his \ncreditors were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions \nis required. \n  \n   \nFive conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may mitigate security concerns and are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d I \nam convinced that he will continue with his two payment plans and resolve all of his \nSOR debts. His SOR debts do not \u201ccast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of separation from his spouse from 2001 to 2003, some brief \nunemployment in 2004, and occasional underemployment after leaving active duty.2 He \ndoes not receive full mitigating credit because he had sufficient information about \nseveral delinquent debts and failed to maintain contact with his creditors. He did not \nestablish that he acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address his delinquent \ndebts after he learned of their existence.     \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling. There are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He understands what \nhe must do to maintain financial responsibility. He paid three debts and the other two \nare in payment plans. He has also established partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) \nbecause he showed some, recent good faith3 in the resolution of his SOR debts. \nApplicant did not contest the validity of any debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His SOR lists five debts totaling about $24,500. \nHe paid three debts, and the other two are in payment plans. He made sufficient \nprogress resolving his SOR debts to mitigate security concerns. I am confident he will \ncontinue to comply with his payment plans until all of his SOR debts are resolved4 \nbecause of his substantial progress on SOR debt resolution.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \n There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. When \nhe became separated from his spouse, he should have been more aggressive in his \nefforts to ensure he and his spouse paid their debts. In February 2009, he received the \nSOR. He did not actively and aggressively investigate and pay one of the debts listed \non his SOR. These factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. \nHis history of delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). He is a law-abiding citizen. His current financial problems were caused by \n \n4 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is \nconditional. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsome factors partially or fully beyond his control: (1) insufficient income; (2) separation \nfrom his spouse; and (3) underemployment. His SOR listed five debts totaling about \n$24,500. He paid three SOR debts, and the other two are in payment plans. He paid \n$8,021 into one payment plan, and still owes $4,356. The other payment plan starts in \nJuly 2009. He made sufficient progress resolving his SOR debts to mitigate security \nconcerns. His other debts, such as his mortgage, car payment, and six credit cards are \ncurrent. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He has completed two \nyears of college. He served on active duty in the Army for 11 years, and received an \nhonorable discharge. He served in Iraq in 2003. His employment history and \ncontributions to a defense contractor speak well for his character. He received financial \ncounseling and understands how to budget and what he needs to do to maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism, and \ntrustworthiness through his service to the Army in war and peace and as an employee \nof a defense contractor.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September\n13, 2007. On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant\nunder Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nMarch 9, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 3, 2008 and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\nand I received the case assignment on October 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on November 5, 2008, for a hearing on November 20, 2008. I convened the\nhearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered eight exhibits (Exhs 1-8) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits (Exhs. A and B)\ncontaining multiple documents that were admitted without objection. He testified on his\nown behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 1, 2008. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 20, 2008, to submit\nadditional evidence. One post-hearing submission was received within the specified\ntime after the conclusion of the hearing. It contained three separate documents marked\nas A-C) and a faxed supplement (Post Hearing 1). The second post hearing document\nwas submitted after the deadline and consisted of one document (Post Hearing 2). The\ngovernment had no objection to either submission and the documents were admitted in\nevidence without objection.\nProcedural Rulings\nThe hearing notice was dated less than 15 days before the hearing date. I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated\nhe was ready to proceed (Tr. 7).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a government contractor working as a\nsystems engineer designing satellite communications systems. He hold both Bachelor\u2019s\nof Science and Master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering and a Master\u2019s degree in\nBusiness Administration. \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted the three of the four allegations in the SOR\nconcerning two federal tax delinquencies that resulted in liens amounting to\napproximately $37,000 and $25,000 respectively and one defaulted mortgage of\napproximately $28,000. He denied a state tax lien of approximately $1,000. \nThe sequence of events that led to these debts and the actions Applicant is\ntaking to resolve them follows. \nApplicant completed his education in 1994. During his school years, and before,\nhe worked in industry for 13 years. He then started his own business which he operated\nfor ten years until 2004. The first five years were building the business with relatively\nlow income. He became more successful with some government contracts for small\nbusiness innovation research for the second five years but had nine total months of no\nincome in 2002 and 2004 (Exh. A at p. 7). He concluded in 2004 that the company was\n\n3\nunder-capitalized and that he should return to steady employment. It was during this ten\nyear period that he incurred debts and fell behind in payments that gave rise to the\nissues in this matter. \nThe last two years of self employment, 2003 and 2004, Applicant filed his federal\ntax returns but did not pay the taxes but instead paid credit card and other expenses of\ncost of living. This failure to pay taxes resulted in the tax liens filed in 2006 and 2007\nthat are at issue in this matter (SOR \u00b6 1. a. and b.).\nApplicant\u2019s first employment after he returned to salaried employment was a two\nyear personal services contract with a sub-contractor for his present employer. The\ncontract could not be extended so he then obtained employment at a higher salary with\nthe prime contractor in another city. He has continued to be employed there for the past\n18 months with an annual salary ranging from $125,000 to $130,000.\nApplicant purchased a home in 2001 while self employed for $423,000. He lived\nthere until April, 2007, when he moved to his present state of residence. His employer\nhad a relocation program including efforts to sell property of transferred staff but the\nhouse was not sold. His payments became delinquent in July, 2007, since he was\nrenting a home in his new location and had increased living expenses (SOR \u00b6 1.d.). He\nhad a variable rate mortgage with a leading mortgage company at the center of the\ncurrent housing crisis. The payments had been increased to over $3,300 a month but\nwere decreased by $400 per month in March, 2008. He made three offers of settlement\nof the debt that were rejected by the mortgagor who insisted on a full one-time payment\n(Exh. B item 6). Foreclosure was initiated. When a sale date was set for the property, he\nfiled Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May, 2008, to protect from loss of the property. He still\nowns the property and is paying $1,130 per month under the bankruptcy plan to resolve\nthe delinquent debts. At the time of the hearing he had not rented the property but was\nattempting to do so (Tr. 55). Since the hearing the property has been rented and he has\nincome from the rental of $2,200 per month (Post-hearing submission 2). The debts\nnow can be extinguished more rapidly with the increased income. The current balance\nof the delinquent mortgage payments is $11,700. \nThe IRS debts are also included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He has paid the\nbankruptcy trustee since June 2008. At the time of the bankruptcy filing some of these\ndebts had been paid with his income tax refund for 2007, and the balance is now\nreduced to $49,000 (Tr. 18). The original plan indicated that it could be paid off in 60\nmonths with monthly payments. However, the increased income from rental of his\nformer home indicates that it will be paid off in 40 months.\nApplicant\u2019s fourth alleged debt is a state tax lien from Mississippi of\napproximately $1,000 that he is disputing (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) (Tr. 19). Although he was born in\nMississippi where his parents still live, he has never been employed there and believes\nthe debt relates to his parents. During the period covered by the assessment, he was\nliving in two other states in which he paid taxes (Exh. B, Item 7). So far he has been\n\n4\nunsuccessful in having the debt removed from his credit report but he continues the\neffort (Exh. B of first post-hearing submission).\nApplicant was divorced a number of years ago and had no children. He provides\nsome voluntary financial support to his parents and other relatives. He owns two\nautomobiles that are fully paid. He does not now hold a security clearance and has\nnever held one. His employer desires that he have one since his work is limited without\none.\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his employment is approximately $130,000 after a\n$5,000 increase he received in 2008. He is highly regarded by his supervisor who\nspeaks for the company. He has known Applicant since 2001 when he made a\npresentation on behalf of his own company to his present employer. He knows\nproprietary and security requirements (Post-hearing submission Attachment A). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d\nApplicant did incur substantial delinquent debts and was the subject of two federal\ntax liens and a home foreclosure. Thus, the conditions required were established by the\ngovernment sufficient to raise a security concern. \nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant had endeavored to\ncreate a viable business of his own. He struggled to do so with some success but while\ndoing so incurred debts that became delinquent. He has since taken action to resolve the\n\n6\ndebts and to keep possession of the foreclosed home. Thus, I conclude that he has\nacted responsibly and the mitigating condition is applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(d) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. From\nthe evidence presented, this mitigating condition is applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He has provided evidence of a\nreasonable basis for disputing the state tax assessment and has taken, and continues to\ntake, appropriate action to resolve this issue. This mitigating condition is also applicable. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \nApplicant is a mature adult with significant responsibility in his work and a history\nof successful accomplishment both in industry and his academic pursuits. The debts\narose under unique circumstances unlikely to be repeated. There is little or no likelihood\nof a recurrence of the problem and there is no potential for pressure or exploitation of the\nsituation.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For  Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted.\nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has worked for his current employer since May 2005. He has been married since February 1993, and has three daughters, ages 16, 11, and 5 (Tr. 41). He served in the U.S. Navy from September 1988 to August 1995, and he received a security clearance in January 1992. After being released from active duty, he received a clearance from a federal agency in December 1995, but he does not hold a current security clearance. Applicant worked for several companies before his current employer and moved several times at his own expense. He testified he was unemployed in 2001, but the record does not reflect the duration of his unemployment (Tr. 56). When Applicant submitted his SF 86, he disclosed two delinquent debts, a telephone bill and a delinquent personal loan. His CBR dated May 30, 2007, reflected 10 delinquent debts that he did not disclose on his SF 86 (GX 5 at 3-10).

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nJune 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 17, 2009; answered it on January 24, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on January 26, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 17, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on March 19, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 21, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nH, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until May 6, 2009, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX I \nthrough O, which were admitted without objection (Hearing Exhibit I). DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on April 29, 2009. The record closed on May 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, \nand 1.k. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old systems engineer employed by a federal contractor. \nHe has worked for his current employer since May 2005. He has been married since \nFebruary 1993, and has three daughters, ages 16, 11, and 5 (Tr. 41). He served in the \nU.S. Navy from September 1988 to August 1995, and he received a security clearance \nin January 1992. After being released from active duty, he received a clearance from a \nfederal agency in December 1995, but he does not hold a current security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant worked for several companies before his current employer and moved \nseveral times at his own expense. He testified he was unemployed in 2001, but the \nrecord does not reflect the duration of his unemployment (Tr. 56). \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 86, he disclosed two delinquent debts, a \ntelephone bill and a delinquent personal loan. His CBR dated May 30, 2007, reflected \n10 delinquent debts that he did not disclose on his SF 86 (GX 5 at 3-10). In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally omitting the 10 delinquent debts \nfrom his SF 86, stating he answered the questions on his SF 86 to the best of his \nknowledge and was unaware of the undisclosed debts.  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on June 17, 2008, Applicant provided a \nreport from a debt management agency, transmitted on June 20, 2008, indicating that \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f no longer had a balance due; the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.h, 1.l, and 1.n were being disputed; the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was being \nsettled; and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, and 1.o were no longer listed on his \nCBR (GX 6 at 2).  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted a CBR dated April 21, 2009, reflecting he had \nfiled a fraud alert (AX A). He also submitted draft copies of dispute letters to the \ncreditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.l, and 1.m (AX B through H). All the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nletters except AX D and E contained the same text, addressed to the creditor or \ncollection agency and stating that the debt was disputed but not reciting the basis for \nthe dispute. AX D and E were addressed to the credit reporting agencies, recited that \nthe accounts had been disputed and closed, and asked that they be deleted from \nApplicant\u2019s CBR. AX A through H had not been mailed, because Applicant wanted to \nhave them notarized before mailing (Tr. 66). On May 4, 2009, about two weeks after the \nhearing, he mailed the notarized dispute letters (AX J through O).  \n \n \nApplicant testified the $294 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a claim for damage to a \nrented apartment. He had never received a bill from the landlord, and his first notice of \nthe debt was from a collection agency (Tr. 64-65). He testified he disputed the debt \nbecause no one would tell him the basis for the claim (Tr. 65).  \n \n \nApplicant testified the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was paid by a \u201cphone debit,\u201d but \nhe had no documentation for the payment (Tr. 69). He admitted he owed something on \nthe telephone service debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he disputed the amount (Tr. 72-74). The \nsame debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g (Tr. 85).  \n \nApplicant disputed the amount of the credit union debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He received \na response and a settlement offer, but he has not resolved the debt (Tr. 75-76). This \ndebt arose when Applicant took out a line of credit to pay off other debts (Tr. 86).  \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e arose from voluntary auto repossessions in 1998 and \n2001. The latter occurred while Applicant was unemployed. He disputed the amounts \nclaimed through his debt management agency. The debts were not resolved, but they \nwere deleted from his credit report, apparently because they were more than seven \nyears old (Tr. 80).1  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was a payday loan (Tr. 88). The delinquent auto \nloan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i and 1.j arose when Applicant co-signed on the loan for his \nsister-in-law, she defaulted, and the auto was repossessed. The same debt is alleged in \nboth paragraphs, with the face amount of the loan alleged in \u00b6 1.j and the amount due \nafter the repossession alleged in \u00b6 1.i (Tr. 90). He testified he believes his sister-in-law \nmade payment arrangements with the creditor, but he has not discussed the matter with \nher for three or four years, and he provided no documentary evidence of a payment \nplan (Tr. 89-90). \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k was an early termination fee on a satellite \ntelevision service. Applicant testified he believes he made a $50 payment at some time \nin the past, but he provided no documentation of a payment, and the account is not \nsettled (Tr. 92-93).  \n \n                                                          \n1 The Fair Credit Report Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c, prohibits consumer reporting agencies from reporting \nany accounts placed for collection or charged to profit or less that antedate the report by more than seven \nyears, with certain exceptions not applicable to this case. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified he believes the delinquent utility bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l was \nfor a security deposit. He acknowledged that he received utility service, but he decided \nto dispute debt to verify the amount due (Tr. 95).  \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n are medical copayments incurred \nwhen Applicant\u2019s daughter was born. He testified he made one $50 payment but was \nadvised by his debt management agency to stop making payments because he had no \nleverage to negotiate a settlement as long as he made payments (Tr. 98-100). He \nprovided no documentation of any payments. \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o was for an unpaid insurance premium. When \nApplicant failed to pay the premium, the insurance lapsed and the auto was \nrepossessed, giving rise to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e (Tr. 101).  \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the debts alleged in the \nSOR.  \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nApartment \ndamage \n$294 \nDisputed; unresolved \nGX 3 at 1; AX J; \nTr. 64-65 \n1.b \nMedical \n$98 \nNo documentation of payment\nGX 3 at 1 \n1.c \nTelephone \n$485 \nAmount disputed; unresolved \nGX 3 at 2; AX H; \nTr. 72-74 \n1.d \nLine of credit \n$343 \nAmount disputed; settlement \noffered; unresolved \nGX 5 at 5; Tr. 75-\n76 \n1.e \nCar \nrepossession \n$8,698 \nAmount disputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at \n2; Tr. 79-80 \n1.f \nCar \nrepossession \n$15,464 \nDisputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 3; AX M; \nTr. 85 \n1.g \nTelephone \n$535 \nSame debt as 1.c \nTr. 85 \n1.h \nPayday loan \n$374 \nAmount disputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 3; AX K; \nTr. 88 \n1.i \nCar \nrepossession \n$3,256 \nUnpaid \nGX 5 at 8; Tr. 89-\n90 \n1.j \nCar \nrepossession \n$10,551 \nSame debt as 1.i \nGX 5 at 8; Tr. 90 \n1.k \nSatellite TV \n$189 \nUnpaid \nGX 5 at 6; Tr. 92-\n93 \n1.l \nUtilities \n$673 \nAmount disputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 8; AX N; \nTr. 95 \n1.m \nMedical \n$833 \nAmount disputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 8; AX O; \nTr. 98-100 \n1.n \nMedical \n$145 \nAmount disputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 9; Tr. 98 \n1.o \nCar insurance \n$137 \nUnpaid \nGX 5 at 9-10; Tr. \n101 \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on June 17, 2008, Applicant provided a \npersonal financial statement (PFS), reflecting net monthly income of about $6,200, \nexpenses of $5,265, debt payments of $338, and a remainder of $210 (GX 6 at 6). He \ndoes not contribute to a retirement account, and his PFS reflects savings of only about \n$750. He testified at the hearing that his PFS was still accurate as of the date of the \nhearing (Tr. 112). Applicant testified he thought making more money would solve his \nproblems, but it did not because the more he makes the more he spends (Tr. 42). \n \nApplicant engaged several debt management companies but terminated his \nrelationships with them because he did not think the expense was producing sufficient \nresults. He testified he spent about $2,000 in fees but reduced his debt by only about \n$300 (Tr. 110). \n \nApplicant admitted he was aware of the two auto repossessions when he \nexecuted his SF 86 and should have disclosed them. He did not provide any \nexplanation for the omissions (Tr. 102-03).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $42,075. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised by an \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition is raised by \n\u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any \nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the \ndebt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) \nis raised by \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, \nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand (e), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nThe evidence reflects that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g duplicates the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j includes the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. Where the same conduct is alleged twice under the same guideline, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in the applicant\u2019s favor. Therefore, I have \nresolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are numerous, ongoing, and did not arise from unusual circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur. His failure to timely address his delinquent debts casts doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment in 2001 contributed to the car repossession alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f and was beyond his control, but his failure to timely address the debt after he \nbecame gainfully employed with a good income was not responsible conduct. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas worked with several debt management companies, but the objective of these \ncompanies has been to negotiate settlements or cause old debts to be purged from a \nclient\u2019s CBRs. He presented no evidence of financial counseling designed to prevent \nfurther indebtedness, and he has not shown \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial \nproblems are being resolved. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means requires reasonableness, prudence, honesty, \nand adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant testified he made a few sporadic $50 payments on \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis delinquent debts, but he provided no documentation of any payments, and he has \notherwise done little to resolve them. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nhas disputed every debt alleged in the SOR, but his testimony made it clear that, except \nfor the debt alleged in the SOR \u00b6 1.a, he has used the dispute process as a negotiating \ntool rather than a means to challenge erroneous CBR entries. He did not send his \ndispute letters until after the hearing. His testimony establishes, however, that he has \ndisputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a because he does not believe it is a legitimate debt. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but not for the \nremaining debts. \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by \nintentionally failing to disclose numerous delinquent debts in response to questions \nabout financial delinquencies. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as \nfollows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a \nfalsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence \nas a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was aware of at least two undisclosed debts arising \nfrom car repossessions and that he should have disclosed them. He gave no plausible \nor credible explanation for not disclosing them. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant\u2019s efforts to correct his omission and misleading \nanswers were neither prompt nor entirely in good faith. There is no evidence Applicant \nattempted to correct his omissions before he was confronted with them. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of his application was not \u201cminor.\u201d It was recent and did not occur under \ncircumstances unlikely to recur. He receives some credit under this guideline because \nthe record reflects no other instances of falsification and thus was \u201cinfrequent,\u201d but his \nlack of candor on his current application casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not fully established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). The record reflects no action by Applicant to fully \ndisclose the extent of his financial problems until he was confronted by the evidence. I \nconclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He served honorably in the Navy for seven years and \nheld a clearance during his Navy service, apparently without incident. His Navy service \nshould have made him familiar with the security clearance process and the need for \nabsolute candor during the process. His inability to manage his personal finances and \nhis lack of candor on his security clearance application raise doubt about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct.

On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F  for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on July 28, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 30, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on October 23, 2008, in La Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her\nown behalf and submitted no documents at the time of hearing. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on October 31, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\n\n2\nthe record open until October 30, 2008, to submit additional documents. She timely\nsubmitted an additional document, a one page letter which has been identified and\nentered into evidence as Exhibit A, and the record closed on October 30, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. She is currently married and has two children. She has\nreceived two Associates of Arts degrees. She served in the United States Air Force\nfrom 1998 to 2007. \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor, although she is not currently\nemployed by that company, but she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with\nher employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists eight allegations (1.a. through 1.h.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, with overdue debts totaling $31,861. As discussed\nabove, in her RSOR Applicant admitted that each allegation in the SOR is correct. At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that the total amount of each debt is still unpaid. The\ntotal owed from each debt will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the\nSOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,475.\nThis debt is from credit card charges.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,226.  \nThis debt is from credit card charges.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,373. \nThis debt is from credit card charges.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,341.\nThis debt is from credit card charges. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,379. \nThis debt is from credit card charges.\n\n3\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,353.\nThis debt was from the repossession for a vehicle, which Applicant purchased in 2001,\nbut had repossessed in 2006. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $470. \nThis debt is for telephone charges.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $13,244. \nThis debt is from credit card charges.\nApplicant testified that her financial difficulties primarily because her family lost\ntheir possessions during Hurricane Katrina. However, upon cross examination, Applicant\nconceded to Department Counsel that since she was in the Air Force at the time of the\nhurricane, she was compensated under the Claims Act for her and her family\u2019s\npossessions.  She eventually had a permanent change of station orders and made a\ndecision to resign from the Air Force, when she became concerned that she may have\nbeen deployed and she did not have proper supervision for her children. \n I find that the majority of the debts listed on the SOR were incurred prior to\nHurricane Katrina.  It was because of her loss of income after leaving the Air Force that\nshe became unable to pay off these debts. Hurricane Katrina was not the primary factor\nthat contributed to her financial difficulties. \nAt this point Applicant is unemployed and only receives unemployment\ncompensation. While her husband still earns an income, she has not been able to\nresolve any of the debts listed on the SOR, and there is no indication when she would be\nable to settle these debts.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\n\n4\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay any of her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, while\nApplicant argued that her financial problems were the result of Hurricane Katrina, which\nwould certainly put this case under this mitigating condition, I find that the financial\nproblems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s personal decision to resign from the Air Force\nwith no significant income available. She was compensated for the personal property\nthat she lost form Hurricane Katrina.  Additionally, I can not conclude that Applicant has\nacted responsibly under these circumstances, because she has failed to contact the\ncreditors of these overdue debts, and she has failed to attempt to seek some kind of\nfinancial counseling that might help her to ascertain a way to resolve these overdue\ndebts. Therefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n Applicant has not resolved any of her overdue debt. I conclude that until she is\nable to significantly reduce this overdue debt, she has not mitigated the financial\nconcerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the\nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an\noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and\nthe whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition  applies, I\nfind that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 20, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and his hearing testimony for a description of the debts and their status (Tr. 43\u201365).\n3\n2\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 8, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on September 25, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nOctober 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts ranging from $131 to\n$82,735 for a total of about $119,000. The largest of the debts is a student loan. He\ndenied 18 of the 19 debts, except for the student loan debt. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old commercial designer. He has worked for his current\nemployer since June 2005. His gross annual salary is about $46,000. He married in\n1989 and divorced in 2004. He has two children, both of whom live with their mother. He\npays child support and he says he is current with this obligation. He earned an\nassociate\u2019s degree in 1992 and is now working on a bachelor\u2019s degree in marketing, the\ncost of which is paid by his employer. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which at the hearing he did not\ndispute. His history of financial problems is established by a 2007 credit report and a\n2008 credit report (Exhibits 3 and 4). The largest debt is a student loan, which was\nplaced with a collection agency, and as of April 11, 2008, the balance was $82,735\n(Exhibit 2 at 6). He attributes his financial problems to a bad marriage wherein his\nspouse ran up credit card bills and hid matters from him. \nThe status of the 19 debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the following\ntable.3\n\n3\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$279 collection account.\nPaid in August 2008. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$131 collection account.\nUnresolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$1,283 charged-off account.\nMade two payments of $20.\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$983 charged-off account.  \nMade two payments of $20. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$2,192 charged-off account. \nMade two payments of $20.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013$492 charge-off account.\nSettled for $150 in September 2008. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013$403 charged-off account. \nMade one payment of $10.\nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013$406 charged-off account.\nDisputed and deleted from credit report.\nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013$303 charged-off account.\nDisputed and deleted from credit report.\nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013$6,750 collection account.\nUnresolved.\nSOR \u00b6 1.k\u2013$997 collection account.\nUnresolved.\nSOR \u00b6 1.l\u2013$1,503 collection account.\nUnresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m\u2013$1,258 collection account.\nDisputed and deleted from credit report.\nSOR \u00b6 1.n\u2013$777 collection account.\nMade two payments of $10.\nSOR \u00b6 1.o\u2013$82,735 student loan.\nOriginal loan amount was about $20,000.\nMade $553 payment in June 2008 and a\n$150 payment in September 2008;\nworking with Department of Education or\ncollection agency or both in effort to\nrehabilitate the loan.\nSOR \u00b6 1.p\u2013$6,684 charged-off account.\nMade one payment of $50.\nSOR \u00b6 1.q\u2013$3,657 collection account.\nUnresolved.\nSOR \u00b6 1.r\u2013$5,816 charged-off account.\nUnresolved.\nSOR \u00b6 1.s\u2013$2,611 charged-off account.\nUnresolved. \nTo sum up, two accounts are paid or settled, seven accounts have seen some\npayments, three accounts were disputed and deleted, and seven accounts are\nunresolved.  \nApplicant had about $500 in a checking account and about $200 in a savings\naccount (Tr. 71). He has no other financial assets. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Their efforts to\ndate are reflected in the table above. In addition, he planned to take a course called\n\u201cTransforming Your Finances\u201d in October 2008 (Exhibit A). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n18\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Likewise, the evidence is\nsufficient to establish financial irresponsibility.\n\n6\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered, and except for MC 5, none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nMC 5 applies because he provided documentary evidence that he successfully\ndisputed and deleted three accounts from his credit report. Otherwise, Applicant did not\npresent sufficient evidence to justify applying any MC. In reaching this conclusion, I\nspecifically considered the circumstance that his financial problems are likely due, in\npart, to his marriage that ended in divorce in 2004. But Applicant did not present\nsufficient evidence to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Indeed,\nhis dilatory actions in addressing his financial problems tend to undercut his reliance on\nhis troubled marriage.  \nIn addition, in reaching this conclusion, I specially considered the circumstance\nthat Applicant contacted several of the creditors and made periodic payments to several\nas well, but this is little progress in light of the size of his indebtedness. His track record\nof repayment is skimpy, and coupled with his limited financial means, is not sufficient to\nestablish a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132 (listing nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept). \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d). \n20\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept  (to include his constructive community involvement) was given\n19\ndue consideration and that analysis does not supports a favorable decision. Indeed,\nlooking forward to the next 12 to 18 months, it is unlikely that he will successfully\nresolve his financial problems.  This case is decided against Applicant. \n20\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h\u20131.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j\u20131.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.n\u20131.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest  to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns for financial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 25, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 4, 2008.  She admitted one \nand denied nine of the allegations under Guideline F with detailed explanations.  She \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on December 31, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on January 5, \n2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2009, for a hearing on February \n5, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered four exhibits, \n1 \n \nMarch 4, 2009\n\n2 \n \nmarked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant submitted three exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A \nthrough C, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf.  \nThe record was held open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant \ntimely submitted one document marked App. Ex. D.  Department Counsel had no \nobjection to consideration of the documents (Gov. Ex. 5, Memorandum, dated February \n17, 2009), and the document is admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on February 19, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate with some college credit serving \nas a customer service representative for a defense contractor.  She married on \nNovember 2, 1996 when she was 18 years old.  She and her husband worked various \njobs for about a year before his father turned over the family business to him.  Her \nparents provided them with a house that had only a small mortgage.  Applicant and her \nformer husband took out a second small mortgage to assist with household and \nbusiness expenses.  Applicant gave birth to their only child in February 1998.  Both \nApplicant and her husband worked in the business but Applicant mainly followed her \nhusband's directions on what needed to be done in the business.  She signed whatever \ndocuments her former husband asked her to sign.  Applicant had a child and started \nworking from home.  Unbeknownst to Applicant, her husband was abusing drugs and \nalcohol, using the business assets to pay for his drugs and alcohol.  He also mortgaged \ntheir house again with a higher mortgage.  She was not aware of this mortgage until she \nreceived a notice of foreclosure in the mail.  Applicant's husband took care of all of the \nfamily financial transactions (Tr. 16-17, 23-27; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public \nTrust Position, dated April 26, 2007).  \n \n \nApplicant separated from her husband in June 2000.  A divorce was granted on \nOctober 9, 2001, on the grounds of the husband's habitual drunkenness.  Applicant was \ngranted custody of the child and her husband received visitation privileges.  Her \nhusband was to assume responsibility for most of the debts from the house and the \nmortgage.  Each assumed responsibility for the debts they incurred in their own name.  \nApplicant's husband was ordered to pay child support to include arrears.  Applicant was \nresponsible for one vehicle.  Her husband filed for bankruptcy shortly after she filed for \ndivorce and his debts were discharged.  Applicant did not participate in the bankruptcy \nand did not know about it until informed later by her attorney.  The car Applicant was \nprovided in the divorce was included in the husband's bankruptcy petition.  She was told \nby her husband to return the car to the bank holding the loan on the car.  She returned \nthe car as directed (Tr. 17-19; See Answer to SOR, Divorce Decree, dated October 23, \n2001; Gov. Ex. 2, Answer to Interrogatories, dated August 21, 2008).   \n \n \nAfter the divorce, Applicant moved to be near her parents and was provided a \nhouse they owned.  She worked hard not to accrue debt.  She did not purchase items \non time so she did not see any reason to check her credit history or credit report.  \nApplicant married her second husband in May 2006.  Her second husband is disabled \n\n3 \n \nfrom a motorcycle accident and does not work but draws disability.  Applicant had a \nchild with her second husband, so she now has two children.  She worked at various \njobs until she found steady employment in April 2007 with the defense contractor (Tr. \n23-27). \n \n \nApplicant is a high producer for her employer.  Her performance is rated above \naverage (App. Ex. A, Letter, dated January 7, 2009).  Her productivity results are \nconsistently almost more than 200% of the employer's goal (App. Ex. B, Associate \nProductivity Report, Various dates).  She has numerous awards for outstanding \nperformance and exceeding standards (App. Ex. C, Award certificates, various months).  \nApplicant's manager notes she is a dedicated professional employee with exceptional \ncustomer service skills.  She can be counted on to work hard and accurately.  She is a \npleasure to work with. Ten fellow workers and family members wrote letters of reference \nstating that she is a smart, dedicated, hard worker who is trustworthy and reliable (App. \nEx. A, Letters, various dates).   \n \n \nApplicant is paid hourly at the rate of $10.05 by her employer.  She does not \nreceive overtime.  Her monthly net salary is $1,389.46.  She receives $432 in monthly \nchild support.  Her husband receives $558 monthly in disability.  The family's combined \nmonthly income is $2,379.  Their monthly recurring expenses are approximately $1,600 \nleaving a monthly net remainder in discretionary or disposable funds of approximately \n$600 (Tr. 39-48). \n \n \nA credit report (Gov. Ex. 4, dated May 9, 2007) shows the following ten \ndelinquent debts listed for Applicant: a credit card debt charged off for $3,838 (SOR \n1.a); a utility debt in collection for $167 (SOR 1.b); a charged off department store \naccount for $166 (SOR 1.c); an account charged off for $68 (SOR 1.d); a credit card in \ncollection for $2,765 (SOR 1.e); a medical debt in collection for $130 (SOR 1.f); a cell \nphone debt in collection for $1,077 (SOR 1.g); a collection account for a storage \ncompany for $359 (SOR 1.h); a credit card account in collection for $5,836 (SOR 1.i); \nand a charged off account for a car loan for $8,567 (SOR 1.j).  \n \n \nApplicant is unaware of a number of the delinquent debts.  She did not become \naware of the debts until she received the SOR.  She believes the debts were incurred \nby her former husband either without her knowledge or creditors are pursuing her for \nthe debts since her former husband's bankruptcy action discharged the debts for him \nleaving her as the only account holder (Tr. 17, 25-27).   \n \n \nSOR delinquent debt 1.a is for a credit card.  Applicant believes she was placed \non the credit card by her husband as a co-signer.  She did not have a credit card with \nthe creditor in her own name.  She cannot recall what the card was used for, the \nbalance, or why it was not paid.  She believes her former husband was the principle \nuser of the card and he incurred the debts.  She has not made any payments towards \nthis account.  She does not believe the debt is her debt (Tr. 28-29).   \n \n \nSOR delinquent debt 1.b is a utility debt for the house she and her former \nhusband lived in.  After they separated, her husband moved out and she and her son \n\n4 \n \nlived in the house until it was foreclosed.  Her husband was to pay the expenses from \nthe house, and the utility service was in his name.  She does not remember a bill from \nthe utility company.  She has not made any payments on this bill since she believes it is \nnot her debt but her former husband's debt (Tr. 29-30).    \n \n \nSOR Delinquent SOR 1.c is for a department store account.  Applicant had an \naccount with the department store.  When she separated from her former husband, she \ndestroyed her credit cards.  At the time, her department store account was at zero \nbalance.  She does not know who used the credit card or incurred the debt, but it is not \nher debt (Tr. 30-31).   \n \n \nSOR delinquent debts 1.d and 1.f are medical debts in collection.  Applicant has \nno knowledge of these debts.  She always had medical insurance or Medicaid. She \nnever received correspondence from the creditors or the collection agencies (Tr. 32-34).   \n \n \nSOR delinquent debts 1.e and 1.i are for credit card debts in collection.  \nApplicant never had an account with either of the credit card companies.  She never \nreceived any information from the creditors or collection companies on these delinquent \ndebts.  She believes the debts arose when her former husband opened and used the \ncredit cards without her knowledge for his purposes (Tr. 35-37). \n \n \nSOR delinquent debt 1.g is for a cell phone bill.  Applicant admits this debt and \nacknowledges that she incurred a debt of about $500 on her cell phone.  She asked the \ncell phone company to convert her plan to a different payment plan so she would not \nincur as much expense.  The company refused to change the plan so Applicant \nreturned her phone and cancelled the plan and refused to pay the bill.  The bill \ncontinued to accrue expenses and is still unpaid (Tr. 34-36).  After the hearing, \nApplicant contacted the phone company and was informed the debt was now for \n$1,077.33 and had been sold to a collection agency.  The company was unable to \nassist her since the account had been sold.  Applicant tried to contact the collection \nagency but was unsuccessful.  She did learn that there are numerous complaints \nagainst the collection agency because people cannot reach them to settle or dispute \ndebts.  She intends to contact the credit reporting agency to register her dispute \nconcerning the debt and have the debt removed from her credit report (App. Ex. D, \nLetter with attachments, dated February 16, 2009). \n \n \nSOR delinquent debt 1.h is a debt for space at a storage facility.  When Applicant \nvacated the house she shared with her former husband, she moved to a smaller house \nowned by her parents.  She placed furniture and other items in storage paying $60 per \nmonth.  She paid the storage fee for a short time, but was unable to maintain the \nmonthly payments because of low paying and sporadic employment.  She defaulted a \nfew months on the payments and the storage company auctioned Applicant's items in \nthe facility to pay the storage delinquent fees.  Applicant claims that the auctioned items \nsold were worth substantially more than the debt owed on the storage facility.  Since \nshe believes the storage company was reimbursed for the delinquent fees from the \nauctioned contents, she refuses to pay the debt (Tr. 37-38). \n \n\n5 \n \n \nSOR delinquent debt 1.j is for a car that was repossessed by the lender.  \nApplicant received the car as part of the divorce degree.  She was making payments on \nthe car, but Applicant's former husband included the car debt in his bankruptcy.  As part \nof his bankruptcy, the car had to be returned to the creditor.  He informed Applicant she \nhad to return the car to the bank which she did.  Approximately 18 months later, \nApplicant tied to cash a check at her bank which was the same bank that held the note \non the repossessed car.  She was informed that her bank account had been drafted for \nover $2,000 to pay at least part of the remaining debt on the car.  Even though her \nformer husband was cleared of the debt under the bankruptcy, Applicant was still \nresponsible for the debt.  With the bankruptcy, the sale of the car, and the funds taken \nfrom her account, Applicant does not believe she has a debt for the car.  She is not \nmaking any further payments on the car debt (Tr. 37-39).   \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n6 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a security concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from a car, medical debts, credit cards, and \ntelephone bills, as established by a credit report and Applicant\u2019s statements and \ntestimony, are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 \n19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial obligations\".   \n \n \nI have considered a number of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \n(FC MC).  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) \"the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" applies in part.  \nWhile the debts were incurred some time ago, they are still unpaid and thus considered \ncurrent.  There are a number of different accounts and debts, so delinquent debt was \n\n7 \n \nincurred frequently.  Most of the delinquent debts were incurred by Applicant's husband \nto pay for his abuse of illegal drugs and alcohol.  Her former husband was released \nfrom the debts by bankruptcy, but Applicant as a cosigner is still liable for the debts.  \nShe has tried to pay her cell phone debt but cannot locate contact information for the \ncollection agency.  Applicant believes two debts were satisfied by sale of items or \npayment of the debt.  The debts were incurred under the unusual circumstances of her \ndivorce and her former husband's incurring the debts for his alcohol and drug abuse.  \nThese circumstances are not likely to recur.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\" applies.  All of Applicant's debts are \ndirectly related to the actions of her former husband.  Applicant and her former husband \nhad a potentially comfortable lifestyle before he turned to drug and alcohol abuse.  \nBecause of his actions, they lost this comfortable lifestyle and incurred delinquent debt.  \nApplicant was unaware of her husband's problems or actions that caused financial \nproblems.  After learning of the issues, Applicant divorced her former husband.  The \ndivorce decree settled property issues, and her former husband had responsibility for \nmost of the debts incurred in the marriage.  She had responsibility for only the debts \nincurred by her in her name.  However, Applicant's former husband filed for bankruptcy \nwithout her knowledge and his part of the debts were discharged.  The creditors then \nsought to collect on the debts from Applicant.  The actions leading to the debts were \ncaused by her former husband without Applicant's knowledge.  His actions were beyond \nher control.  Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances, by divorcing her \nformer husband as soon as she learned of the problems, finding steady employment, \nnot incurring additional delinquent debts, and living within her means. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(a) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\" does not apply.  Applicant presented no information concerning financial \ncounseling.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) 'the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" applies in part.  Applicant had no \nknowledge of seven of the debts which she believes were incurred by her former \nhusband without her knowledge until she received the SOR.  She has not paid any of \nthese debts since she believes she is not responsible for them.  She tried to pay a cell \nphone debt but has not been able to obtain contact and payment information.  Two \nother debts should have been satisfied by auction of furniture and repossession and \npayment on a car.  Applicant presented sufficient information to show she is either not \nresponsible for the debts or made as good an effort as she could under her \ncircumstances to resolve her past due obligations.  Even though she is steadily \nemployed, her employment does not provide sufficient income to pay the delinquent \ndebts incurred by her former husband to fuel his drug and alcohol abuse.  She merely \nhas sufficient income to meet her present financial requirements.  While she has \noutstanding delinquent debts that may legally and technically be her responsibility, she \n\n8 \n \ndoes not have the financial means to address them.  She has tried to resolve the one \ndebt she is responsible for but has been unable to do so because of the collection \nagency lack of contact information.  She reasonably believes two debts have been \nsatisfied by sale or auction of items.  She has made a reasonable effort under the \ncircumstances to resolve her debts.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has presented sufficient \ninformation to show the majority of the listed debts were not caused by her actions but \nby the actions of her former husband, an alcohol and drug abuser.  She has tried to \ncontact a collection agency for one debt to no avail.  She does not believe she owes a \ndebt on a repossessed car and a storage fee because the debts should have been \nsatisfied by sale of furniture and sale of the car coupled with another payment.  \nApplicant presented information to establish that she is an excellent and productive \nemployee.  Her employer has constantly rewarded her for her work ethic and \nperformance.  Her supervisors, friends, and family have attested to her efforts and her \nreputation for reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe circumstances concerning how Applicant incurred the delinquent debts are \nan important consideration in determining Applicant's suitability for a position of public \ntrust.  She incurred the debts through the actions of her former husband in accruing \ndebt to pay for his drugs and alcohol abuse.  Applicant was left with the debts after a \ndivorce and the discharge of her husband's debts by bankruptcy.  After learning of her \nformer husband's drug and alcohol abuse, she took control of her life, divorced him, \nmoved closer to her parents for support, found steady employment, and did not use \ncredit cards.  She demonstrated she is responsibly managing her present finances \nunder the circumstances.  The management of present finances indicates she will be \n\n9 \n \nconcerned, responsible, and not careless concerning sensitive information.  Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) signed on January 17, 2008. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nJuly 15, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn August 12, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG).2 In her Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on September 11, 2008, \nApplicant denied all the allegations.3 She also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 20, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me February 26, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April \n9, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 12, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered six exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted. Applicant testified and offered six \nexhibits, which were admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F. I held the record \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant did not submit further \ndocumentation. DOHA received the transcript on May 18, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement \nof Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 68 years old, holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science. She is \ndivorced and has no children. Applicant was a career civil servant, working as a foreign \nservice officer from 1969 to 1992. She held a high-level security clearance during that \ntime. From 1992 to approximately 2003, she was self-employed.

The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006.  \n \n3 Applicant's Answer included five attachments, which will be identified as Answer document: 1 \u2013 \nApplicant letter dated September 11, 2008; 2 - Applicant letter dated April 10, 2008; 3 \u2013 Personal \nFinancial Statement dated April 11, 2008; 4 \u2013 Letters to credit reporting agencies dated June 10, 2008; 5 \n\u2013 Secure facility visit request dated March 28, 2006. \n\n \n \n3\nconsultant. She was nominated for a mentorship award because of her consistent help \nand support to junior staff at her employment (GE 2; AE C; Tr. 36-37). \n \nBetween 1992 and 2003, Applicant was a small-business owner. She established \nher businesses using online services, without the aid of an attorney. She operated three \nbusinesses: Business A dealt with food aid and food security; Business B worked on \nissues of human rights and internally displaced persons; and Business C was an effort \nat entrepreneurship and involved with network marketing. The legal form of each \nbusiness changed over time. Applicant testified that Business A was initially established \nas a small Subchapter S corporation. Her attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) \nadvised her that the business was not producing sufficient money and she should \nchange it to a limited liability corporation (LLC), which she did. Ultimately, it was again \nchanged in form to a sole proprietorship (Tr. 81-82; 86). Businesses B and C were \ninitially small Subchapter S corporations, and later sole proprietorships (Tr. 82-83; 86). \nThe record is silent as to when Applicant changed the legal form of each company. \n \nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, Applicant lost clients, her businesses \nfailed, and in December 2001, she ceased operation. For about one and one-half years \nafter the failure, she was unable to obtain work as a consultant, had little income, and \nrelied on her federal pension (Tr. 76; 106). She did not have the funds to pay the debts \nof her businesses. When she consulted with her attorney in 2002, he advised her not to \nfile for bankruptcy (Tr. 74). He also advised her not to pay the debts, because the \ncreditors eventually would write them off (Tr. 46; 77). Her understanding was that this \n\u201cwould happen automatically\u201d (Tr. 76). \n \nThe attorney wrote to Applicant's creditors advising that she did not have the \nfunds to pay the debts or to establish payment plans. He also contacted the creditors \nverbally. The attorney then wrote to Applicant, informing her of his actions. She could \nnot provide a copy of his letter. The attorney also did not provide Applicant with \ndocumentation about his contacts. Applicant did not pay the business debts. At about \nthe same time, she became ill, and she turned her attention elsewhere: \u201cAnd so no, I \nput the whole matter behind me at that point and never thought about it again to tell you \nthe truth.\u201d (Tr. 74\u201379; 84).  \n \nIn March 2002, Applicant discovered that the debts of her businesses were listed \non her credit bureau report as her personal debts, under her social security number, \ninstead of under her business tax identification number (GE 3; AE A; Tr. 52). She had \nunderstood that she was not personally liable for these business debts (Tr. 43; 83). \nBetween 2002 and 2005, she wrote to the credit reporting agencies approximately once \nper year asking that the debts be removed. She did not provide evidence of these \ncontacts. The credit reports were not corrected and Applicant did not follow up (Tr. 94). \nShe also testified that she was \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cbored with it.\u201d (Tr. 52-53). In about 2005, she \nbecame concerned about the debts when she realized she would be completing a \nsecurity clearance application for a position with a federal contractor (Tr. 80). In April \n\n \n \n4\n2008, after she received financial interrogatories from DOHA, she wrote to the three \ncredit reporting agencies (AE D). She sent the same letters to the American Fair Credit \nAssociation and the Bureau of Consumer Protection of the Federal Trade Commission \nasking them to correct her credit bureau reports (AE F). She contacted the same \norganizations again in May 2009 (AE D).  \n \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling or professional legal help in relation \nto the debts, nor worked with creditors or collection agencies who have contacted her. \n \nMR. JAKSETIC:  Have any of the creditors or any collection agency \nacting on behalf of the creditors asked you to make payment on \nany of the debts in the last two years? \n \nAPPLICANT:  Since I haven't talked to any of them, I don't know.  \nAnd have people sent letters suggesting they would cut $5,000 or \n$10,000 off of this or that, yes.  But I -- I didn't respond to those. \n \nMR. JAKSETIC:  Okay.  To the best of your recollection, when was \nthe last time you spoke with any creditor that's covered by the SOR \ndebts or any collection agency acting on behalf of a creditor? \n \nAPPLICANT:  2002. \n \nMR. JAKSETIC:  And you have received correspondence \nsuggesting that you pay less than the full amount? \n \nAPPLICANT:  Yes. \n \nMR. JAKSETIC:  And you have not followed up on those? \n \nAPPLICANT:  That is correct. On a couple I did send my copies of \nmy statements that the information was incorrect and blah, blah, \nblah, but \u2013 \n \nMR. JAKSETIC:  But basically you have not pursued any \ndiscussion about settling the debts, correct? \n \n \n \nAPPLICANT:  That is correct. (Tr. 56-57). \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant noted that she was a victim of identity theft in 2001. \nAlthough she originally stated at the hearing that all the SOR allegations stem from her \nbusiness debts (Tr. 43; 73), she later testified that she does not recognize allegation 1.f. \nbecause it relates to a type of credit card that she has never had. She believes that the \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \ndebt stems from the theft of her identity. That allegation is the only one that is \nconnected with identity theft. (Tr. 89-91).  \n \nApplicant testified that her Personal Financial Statement of April 2008 is \nessentially accurate as to her current income and expenses.4 Her net monthly income \nas a consultant is $7,650, for a net annual income of approximately $91,800.5 She also \nreceives a federal pension of approximately $45,000 per year, which is about $32,500 \nafter deductions. Her net income from both sources is $10,400 per month or \napproximately $125,000 annually. With monthly expenses of $3,770, she has \napproximately $6,330 remaining each month. Applicant listed no debts in her personal \nfinancial statement because she pays cash for her purchases and no longer uses credit \ncards (Tr. 92). She did not list payments on any delinquent debts. She occasionally \nprovides approximately $400 per month to a niece who is physically ill (GE 3;Tr. 62-72).  \n \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges 10 debts, totaling approximately $22,400. \nThree debts range from $110 to $216; one debt is $597. The remaining debts range \nfrom $1,120 to $9,063. The debts became delinquent between 2001 and 2003 (GE 4, 5 \nand 6). Applicant has not incurred new debts, has no credit cards, and has no \noutstanding long-term loans (GE 6; AE A, F; Tr. 92). \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under a \nGuideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant.  However, \nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access \nto classified information.  In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \n4 The single change Applicant noted is that she no longer has the $10,000 in investments, which she lost \nin the stock market (Tr. 72). \n \n5 It is unclear from the record whether Applicant\u2019s position as a consultant is full-time. She \nmentioned working three to six months at a time (Tr. 34) but described her employment income \nas annual (Tr 69).  \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest7 for an Applicant to have access to \nclassified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible \ninformation on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security \nclearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a \nsecurity clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.8 A person who \nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the \ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as her or her own. The \n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe facts presented support application of AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Initially, \nin 2001, Applicant was unable to satisfy the financial obligations that remained after her \n \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7\nsmall businesses lost clients following the events of September 11, 2001. Although her \nfinancial situation has improved, she is now unwilling to pay the debts because she \nbelieves that they were written off, or that she is not personally responsible for them \nbecause they are debts of her businesses. AG \u00b619(c) also applies because Applicant\u2019s \ndebts, which started becoming delinquent around 2002, still appear in her latest credit \nbureau report, and remained unpaid as of the date of the hearing.  \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. The following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b620(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue; \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose when her independent businesses failed. The failure \nstemmed from unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur. However, her debts \nfrom the business ventures remain, they amount to more than $22,000, and they are \nrecent, as they currently remain unpaid. That they were written off by the creditors \ndoes not, as Applicant seems to believe, absolve her of responsibility for them. \nMoreover, the fact that she has done little about them, other than occasional letters, \nreflects poorly on her judgment. AG \u00b620(a) does not apply.  \n \nThe key element in mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) is that the factors that caused \nthe financial problems were beyond an applicant\u2019s control. Certainly, the events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, that led to Applicant's business failure, were unforeseeable and \nbeyond her control. However, to be applicable, this mitigator requires also that the \nperson act responsibly. Applicant did not respond to queries from creditors over the \nyears and has not spoken to any since 2002. In addition, she did not work to resolve \n\n \n \n8\nthe disputes about her debts. Even though she has a substantial income, she did not \nretain legal help to assist her to parse out the legal form of each of her business \nentities between 1993 and 2001, or to determine which debts accrued during those \npoints in time, and which, if any, became Applicant\u2019s responsibility when the \nbusinesses failed. Consequently, Applicant could not provide documentation to support \nher claims to the credit reporting agencies, or this agency, that she did not owe the \ndebts she disputed. Applicant did not act responsibly, and mitigating condition AG \n\u00b620(b) cannot be applied. \n \nAG \u00b620(e) is relevant. Applicant disputes that she owes these debts because (1) \nthey were \u201cwritten off\u201d by arrangement between her attorney and the creditors; and/or \n(2) they are the debts of her defunct businesses and not her personal debts. Applicant \ntestified that her attorney arranged with the creditors to have her debts written off, \napparently believing that this meant they were no longer her responsibility. She \nprovided no evidence supporting her claim of arrangements made with creditors.  \n \nApplicant also claims that she is not responsible for the debts because she is \nshielded from liability by the legal form of her businesses. Each of the three businesses \nexisted in various legal forms over time, including as corporations and as sole \nproprietorships. However, Applicant failed to provide any evidence to show the point in \ntime or the extent to which Applicant may have been protected by the corporate shield \nagainst liability. The lack of documentary evidence to support her dispute prevents \napplication of AG 20 \u00b620(e). I resolve Guideline F against Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \n\n \n \n9\nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nAt the time her debts started to become delinquent, Applicant was a mature and \nexperienced adult. Her actions in regard to her debts raise questions as to her good \njudgment. Since 2002, she has taken minimal actions to resolve the situation. When \ncontacted by creditors, she did not respond. She sent several letters to the credit \nagencies over the years, but became bored and tired of the issue. She might have \nsome protection because the debts stemmed from her businesses. However, despite \nan income that would allow her to retain legal assistance, she has not done so, and the \nquestion of whether or not she is liable for the business debts remains unanswered. \nApplicant's conduct indicates a negligent attitude and poor judgment in regard to her \nfinances.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 The SOR lists two delinquent debts (excluding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which was withdrawn) (Tr. 15-16; GE 8). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a involved a credit card account, D, which was charged off in February 2002 in the amount of $7,805. In September 2004, D obtained a judgment for $10,097. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b related to a bank account, M, charged off in December 2001 in the amount of $9,142. Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b asserting the debts were not lawful (GE 9). He did provide documentation and comments indicating he was familiar with these two accounts and once owed debts to these two creditors. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 50-years-old (Tr. 24).3 He has a certificate for high school completion, and attended college in business administration from 1986 to 1989, earning an associates degree (Tr. 6-7, 24).

One debt \nwas withdrawn as a concern. Another debt was successfully disputed. Applicant failed \nto mitigate financial considerations because he did not provide a reasonable \nexplanation for his failure to resolve one delinquent debt. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 16, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed \nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                           \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn November 5, 2008, Applicant signed his SOR response, and Applicant \nrequested a hearing (GE 9). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on \nDecember 8, 2008, and on December 16, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the \nhearing held on January 12, 2009, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 19),1 and Applicant offered 12 exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A-L) (Tr. \n22-23). Applicant objected to GE 3, a credit report, because it contained false \ninformation (Tr. 19-20). Applicant contended the report should show one debt was not \nApplicant\u2019s, another debt was disputed, and a third debt was a duplication of the \ndisputed debt (Tr. 20). I admitted GE 3 with the stipulation that I understood that one \ndebt was favorably resolved for Applicant, and the other two debts were disputed (Tr. \n21). There were no other objections, and I admitted GEs 1-6 and AEs A-L (Tr. 21-23). \nAdditionally, I admitted the Hearing Notice (GE 7), the SOR (GE 8), and his SOR \nresponse (GE 9). I received the transcript on January 26, 2009.   \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nThe SOR lists two delinquent debts (excluding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which was \nwithdrawn) (Tr. 15-16; GE 8). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a involved a credit card account, D, \nwhich was charged off in February 2002 in the amount of $7,805. In September 2004, D \nobtained a judgment for $10,097. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b related to a bank account, M, \ncharged off in December 2001 in the amount of $9,142. Applicant denied the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b asserting the debts were not lawful (GE 9). He did provide \ndocumentation and comments indicating he was familiar with these two accounts and \nonce owed debts to these two creditors. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.    \n \nApplicant is 50-years-old (Tr. 24).3 He has a certificate for high school \ncompletion, and attended college in business administration from 1986 to 1989, earning \nan associates degree (Tr. 6-7, 24). He has never held a security clearance (Tr. 7). From \nJanuary 2004 to present (except for one month of unemployment in April 2004), he has \nbeen a contractor-truck driver (Tr. 25). He was also unemployed from June to October \n1999, and August 2000 to December 2001, and February 2003 to July 2003. He \nattended tractor-trailer school from July to November 2003. He married his current \n \n1GE 2, Applicant\u2019s responses to DOHA Interrogatories, was missing two pages (Tr. 11, 15, 21). \nAfter the hearing, Department Counsel provided the two missing pages, which I admitted and marked as \nGE 2, pages 4B and 4C. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n3GE 1 (2006 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \nspouse in 1978. His three children were born in 1978, 1980 and 1982. He has never \nserved in the military. His security application did not disclose a police record, or a \nfelony conviction. There is no indication of illegal drug abuse or mental disability. He has \nnever left employment under adverse circumstances. When he completed his 2006 SF \n86, he disclosed his dispute of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He argued in his SF 86 \nthat these two SOR debts were void because of Section 14-a of New York statutes, and \nthe creditors failed to respond to Applicant\u2019s certified letters.  \n \nGeneral Financial Circumstances  \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse do not receive a salary and instead they are \nreimbursed by a corporation for their expenses while traveling (Tr. 33, 50; GE 2 at 3). \nApplicant, his spouse and his son are the officers in the corporation (Tr. 61). He lives in \nhis parent\u2019s home on their farm in New York (Tr. 6, 35, 48; GE 2 at 4). He receives mail \nat his parent\u2019s New York address, but he lives in his corporation\u2019s truck (Tr. 49). The \ntruck has a 22-foot box, and can carry up to 20,000 pounds (Tr. 58). The truck is worth \napproximately $50,000 and is debt free (Tr. 59). He does not have any assets (GE 2 at \n4). The corporation owns his telephone (Tr. 35). The corporation pays for his food and \nclothing when he is on the road, and he is on the road almost continuously (Tr. 35). His \nson lives in his parent\u2019s home and his son pays the electric and cable bill (Tr. 36). \nApplicant does not have any credit card payments (Tr. 36). His only payment is $120 \nper month for a student loan (Tr. 36). His approach is to avoid all debts and live within \nhis means (Tr. 57). When the corporation becomes profitable, Applicant will share in the \nprofits (Tr. 34). The corporate officers have invested the corporate revenue into the \ncorporation and not used the funds for salaries (Tr. 51). The corporation now owns the \ntruck that Applicant drives (Tr. 34). In 2008, Applicant\u2019s income was $6,000 to 8,000 (Tr. \n35). Applicant expects the corporation to be more profitable in the future (Tr. 37).  \n  \n \nApplicant does not make enough money to pay federal taxes (Tr. 42-43). The \ncorporation has a Nevada address for the business, which is an office suite (Tr. 42, 49). \nThe corporation has a phone number in Nevada and a registered agent (Tr. 49). \nNevada does not have a state income tax (Tr. 42). The corporation does file and pay \ntaxes (Tr. 43, 50). He has not filed a federal income tax return for three years (Tr. 43).  \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s assets were used up litigating the custody of his granddaughter \nwith the Department of Social Services (Tr. 60). Applicant estimated $200,000 to \n$250,000 was spent in the litigation (Tr. 60). \n \nDebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a (to creditor \u201cD\u201d) \n \nApplicant admits that he had an account with D and borrowed money from D (Tr. \n27). He asserts the debt to D is void because the creditor charged an excessive interest \nrate and relies upon New York Consolidated Law Service (NY CLS) Section 5-511 (Tr. \n29-30; GE 9 at 3). Section 5-511 provides that a contract seeking repayment of a loan is \nvoid, unless the loan is by a \u201csavings bank, a savings and loan association or a federal \nsavings and loan association,\u201d in such cases the interest will be forfeited (GE 9 at 4). \nApplicant further contends that the creditor committed a misdemeanor by filing a \n\n \n4 \n \n                                           \ndocument with the court stating, \u201cthe account had been stated and taken without \nobjection\u201d knowing that Applicant has sent a letter by certified mail disputing the debt \n(Tr. 29, 39; GE 9 at 3). Finally, the affidavit of service of the sheriff was applied with a \nrubber stamp, which he argued constituted forgery because the sheriff never actually \nsaw the affidavit (Tr. 39; GE 9 at 3, 7; AE G, H).4 D\u2019s subsequent use of the forged \npublic record constituted an additional felony (GE 9 at 3). Applicant did not assert he \nwas not served, instead he contended the service was not done properly because the \nnotice was not attached to the door of his residence, as required under New York law \n(Tr. 53).  \n \nFinally, he asserted that D was not a member of the Federal Reserve, and D is \nnot a national bank (Tr. 37-38). When Applicant opened his account with D, D was \nowned by a New York brokerage firm (Tr. 38). As such, D is not exempt from \ncompliance with the laws of New York state (Tr. 38).   \n \nApplicant provided a statement from D, dated December 11, 2001, indicating: (1) \ncurrent balance owed of $7,636; (2) credit limit of $7,500; (3) no payment made the \nprevious month; (4) purchases using the card are charged an interest rate of 16.99%; \n(5) cash advances are charged an interest rate 20.99%; and (6) the address of the \ncreditor is in Delaware (Tr. 28; GE 9 at 7-8). He provided a letter from the attorney \nrepresenting D, dated February 11, 2002, listing: a balance due of $7,805 (AE F). \nApplicant responded with a certified letter, dated March 11, 2002, asking for a variety of \ndocuments to substantiate the debt (AE G). The March 11, 2002, letter denies \npossessing proof of existence of a contract relationship between the collection agency \nand Applicant (AE G). Applicant disputes the debt because the creditor was not \nresponsive to his concerns about the excessive or usurious interest rates being charged \n(Tr. 27).  \n \nThe original creditor, D, as plaintiff filed a lawsuit and included a document, dated \nSeptember 12, 2003, indicating in the Second Cause of Action, paragraph 6, \u201cOn or \nabout 02/11/2002, an account in the sum of $7,805.19 was stated by Plaintiff to \nDefendant(s) who received and accepted same without objection. Defendant(s) \npromised to pay said stated sum, but no part thereof has been paid\u201d (GE H). The \nlawsuit indicates that D is a Delaware State Bank. Applicant attended some hearings \nconcerning this debt (GE 2 at 4; GE 6 at 2). In an order dated August 31, 2004, the \ncourt specifically rejected Applicant\u2019s contention that he was not served, and stated, \n\u201cAccordingly, an order may enter granting plaintiff summary judgment on its claim \nagainst defendant, and dismissing defendant\u2019s counterclaim.\u201d (GE 6 at 8-9). On \nSeptember 20, 2004, the court issued a judgment against Applicant for $10,097 (GE 5).         \n \nApplicant has not filed any documents with the court disputing the debt because \nhe does not have the time or money to hire an attorney (Tr. 26, 29). Applicant planned \n \n4A handwritten signature of a deputy sheriff, dated November 6, 2003, appears above the \nstamped signature of the sheriff (GE 9 at 9). The affidavit of service states Applicant was notified by \nsubstituted service by affixing it to the door of Applicant\u2019s residence, and by mailing a copy to his \nresidence.  It also lists three attempts to achieve personal service. The signature of the deputy sheriff was \nnotarized, and the notary\u2019s signature does not appear to be a stamped signature.   \n\n \n5 \n \nto pay off his student loan and then accumulate about $10,000 to address the issue (Tr. \n29, 36). He had consulted some attorneys and they wanted a substantial fee in advance \nbefore they would assist him (Tr. 56). He did not want to reward the illegal activity of D \nby paying the debt (Tr. 46). He considered it a matter of integrity not to pay the debt (Tr. \n46, 56-57). He was not going to pay the debt until after he had hired an attorney to \naddress the issue (Tr. 55).  Ultimately, if he lost his case he said he would pay the debt \n(Tr. 55).  \n \nDebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b (to creditor \u201cM\u201d) \n \nApplicant admitted he opened a credit card account with M in approximately \n1998 (Tr. 30). From time-to-time he probably made some late payments on his debt to \nM (Tr. 33). In around December 2001, he chose not to pay his debt to M because M \nwas charging an excessive interest rate (Tr. 31, 40). He informed M using the telephone \nof his concerns about the interest rate he was being charged (Tr. 31). He thought M did \nnot pursue the debt because M recognized it was not in their best interests (Tr. 44). M \nmay have exposure under New York state laws for improper banking practices (Tr. 44). \n \nApplicant provided a statement from M, dated January 21, 2002, indicating: (1) \ncurrent balance of $9,142; (2) account holder since 1999; (3) no payment made the \nprevious month; (4) interest rate charged is 22.98%; and the address of the creditor is in \nDelaware (GE 9 at 13). M is a large national bank. On September 5, 2002, M \ntransferred the debt in the amount of $11,042 to a Texas collection agency (GE 9 at 23). \nOn February 5, 2002, the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a in the amount of $9,142 was transferred \nto a New York collection agency (GE 9 at 27). On July 23, 2003, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a transferred the debt in the amount of $9,112 to a creditor located in Florida for \ncollection (GE 9 at 18, 19). On December 4, 2003, this account in the amount of $9,112 \nwas transferred to a collection agency in California (Tr. 41; GE 9 at 14).  \n \nOn March 11, 2002, November 22, 2002, August 15, 2003 and January 5, 2004, \nApplicant sent letters by certified mail to the new creditors in New York, New Jersey, \nFlorida and California asking for a variety of documents from the creditor to prove the \nestablishment and ownership of the debt (Tr. 41; GE 9 at 15-17, 20-22, 24-26, 28-30). \nHe denied having a contract with New York, New Jersey, Florida and California \ncollection agencies. Id. He disputed the debt. Id. At Applicant\u2019s Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) interview on October 16, 2007, Applicant denied having a credit \ncard or account from M (GE 2 at 4, 7). He also said on May 19, 2008, in response to an \ninterrogatory about a debt to M stated, \u201cI have not received any notice of any claim \nalleged or otherwise from them. I have no other actual knowledge regarding the alleged \ndebt.\u201d (GE 2 at 7). However, he attached a bill from creditor M to his response (GE 2 at \n18). M did not reply to Applicant\u2019s letter, instead the account was transferred to another \ncreditor for collection (Tr. 41). The creditor acknowledges the account is disputed (Tr. \n41). The creditor\u2019s failure to contradict or oppose Applicant\u2019s claims is an implicit \nconcession that he is correct (Tr. 44-45). Finally, the failure to enforce the debt to M, \nhas resulted in a statute of limitations defense to the debt (Tr. 45). \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant has not hired an attorney or filed any documents with a court disputing \nthe debt to M (Tr. 32). He may accumulate funds and then hire an attorney to litigate the \nvalidity of the debt (Tr. 36-37). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n7 \n \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n   \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude relevant security concern are under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his credit report, his 2006 security clearance application, his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories and his SOR response. After withdrawal of SOR \u00b6 \n1.c, Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged two delinquent debts totaling about $19,000. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised financial \n\n \n8 \n \nconsiderations security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any \nappropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions. \nHis financial problems are somewhat isolated because he currently has one large, \nestablished delinquent debt totaling about $10,000, which is supported by a judgment in \n2004 for $10,000. The ongoing nature of this delinquent debt is \u201ca continuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nMoreover, I am not convinced this debt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d Since September 2004, a valid judgment against Applicant has \nexisted and he has not acted to resolve this debt. Although he has been paying some of \nhis debts, such as his student loan, and generally pays all bills with cash, he has failed \nto make any payments on this $10,000 judgment for more than four years.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s intermittent unemployment contributed to \nhis financial problems. Litigation over the custody of his grandchild also contributed to \nhis financial problems. As such, some of his financial problems are due to forces \nbeyond his control. However, he did not provide sufficient information to establish that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. He did not demonstrate sufficient efforts \n\n \n9 \n \ns.  \n                                           \nto address his sole enforceable delinquent debt for $10,000.5 He also receives some \ncredit for informing his creditors, D and M, that he was not going to pay these two debts, \nand for keeping his creditors informed of the status of the debts.      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies because Applicant received financial counseling, and \nclearly understands financial matters. However, there are no indications that \u201cthat the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d because there has been no progress \ninvolving resolution of his delinquent debt. There is insufficient information to establish \nthat Applicant showed good faith6 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts \nbecause he did not establish that his failure to pay his delinquent debts was reasonable \nand necessary under the circumstance\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b because Applicant disputed his \nresponsibility for the debt to M, and the three subsequent holders of the debts. He \ndenied borrowing money or receiving a credit card from the three subsequent holders of \nthe debts and quite reasonably asked for proof of the debt. However, no proof was \nforthcoming. The record does not have sufficient evidence to prove by a preponderance \nof evidence that his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is valid for any particular creditor. Applicant also \nraised the issue of the 6-year statute of limitations under New York law for enforcement \nof the debt (based on contract). See N. Y. Civil Practice Law and Rules, Article 2, \nSection 213.7 The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is mitigated.  \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n7The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of \napplication of the statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they \nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant raised the applicability of New York usury law to negate the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. National banks are not subject to state laws prescribing usurious interest, \ninstead they are governed by Federal statutes and New York usury law is not a \ndefense. See National City Bank v. Levine, 155 Misc 132, 277 NYS 664 (1933), see \ngenerally Kimball v. National Bank of North America, N.A., 468 F.Supp 1069 (E.D. NY \n1979), aff\u2019d without op, 614 F.2d 1288 (2d Cir. 1979). Federal law permits national \nbanks and state-chartered FDIC-insured depository institutions to charge the highest \nrate allowed by the laws of the state where the institution is chartered, even if such rate \nexceeds the usury laws in the state where the borrower is located. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 85, \n1831d. Applicant was clearly aware of the issue of where a bank is chartered as he \nprovided lists of national banks, federal branches and agencies, credit card banks, and \ntrust banks (AE B-E). The bank in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a Delaware bank, not a New York bank, \nand thus New York usury laws are not applicable.   \n \nApplicant raised the issue of whether exceeding the usury cap under New York \nusury law voided the debt. CLS Gen Oblig \u00a7 5-513 provides that once a borrower starts \nto repay a usurious loan, the borrower can recover from lender only the amount of \nmoney borrower paid that was more than legal interest. See Dollar Dry Dock Sav. Bank \nv. Bellino, 206 App. Div. 2d 499, 615 NYS 2d 70 (1994).  Under this case, the whole \ndebt may not be void.    \n \nAssuming the initial agreement was not usurious, an obligation valid when \ncreated, is not rendered unenforceable by any subsequent usurious agreements \nbetween the parties, and it is only subsequent usurious agreements that are deemed \nvoid. Dicter v. Viking Office Products, Inc., 119 App. Div. 2d 794, 501 NYS 2d 420 \n(1986). For example, in an action to invalidate a note as usurious, the plaintiff was not \nentitled to summary judgment on the grounds she was required to pay interest at the \nrate of 24% per year during a 3-month extension period. The argument that the new \nrate exceeded the maximum rate of 16% allowed under CLS Bank \u00a7 14-a failed \nbecause the defense of usury does not apply where interest exceeds the statutory \nmaximum only after default or maturity. See Hicki v. Choice Capital Corp., 264 A.D.2d \n710, 694 NYS 2d 750 (1999). Applicant did not provide a copy of his original contract, \nwhich may have permitted the creditor to transfer or assign the debt. The original \ncontract may have had a Delaware address. If Applicant was late on a payment, the \ncreditor may have been permitted to exceed 16% interest. Applicant did not establish \n \nto human affairs.  The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations \nis the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, \nstatutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of \ntime, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred claims.  Moreover, \nlimitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations \nare, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The reduction in the magnitude and number of debts that \ncreditors can legally enforce because of the application of the statute of limitations reduces the potential \nvulnerability to improper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is \u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d \nis also reduced. However, it does not negate the debtor\u2019s past conduct, which failed to take more \naggressive actions to resolve the financial jeopardy. \n\n \n11 \n \nwhether or not the original interest rate was usurious, whether he ever had a default (a \nlate payment may result in a default), or the interest rate may have otherwise changed \nover the period of the loan.   \n         \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to his delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He failed \nto resolve or pay or offer to pay the creditor holding this judgment. He failed to make \npartial payments on this debt after the 2004 judgment was adjudicated against him. He \ndid not provide good cause for his failure to pay or at least to set up a payment plan, \nand make some payments despite having an opportunity to do so. Based on my \nevaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude financial considerations are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I hereby incorporate all of my comments \nunder the preceding discussions of the pertinent adjudicative guidelines into this section.  \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. His dedication to his work and his country is a very positive indication \nof his good character and trustworthiness. He is loyal to his country. Applicant\u2019s record \nof good employment and law-abiding character weighs in his favor. There is no \nevidence of any security violation, or criminal activity. Some of his financial problems \narose from his periodic unemployment, and the expensive custody litigation involving \nhis grandchild. His corporation is paying his expenses, but is not paying him additional \nfunds that he could use to address this debt. He said his pay from the corporation in \n2008 was only $8,000, which raises the concern that in 2008 he lacked the ability to \naddress this debt. There is no allegation that any non-SOR debts are delinquent. These \nfactors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines is not sufficient to warrant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s \ndecision not to file a federal income tax return the last three years raises some concern \nabout his financial well being and compliance with tax law. Willful failure to file an \nincome tax return may violate 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. A taxpayer's failure to file may be willful \neven though he believed he had no taxable income or insufficient taxable income to be \nrequired to file return. See United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (D. Wisc. 1969). \nHowever, violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 is not alleged in the SOR, and all potential \ndefenses were not explored at his hearing. I decline to infer anything negative against \nApplicant concerning his failure to file income tax returns for the last three years. \nSimilarly, assuming he did not file an individual New York state income tax return, I \ndecline to draw any adverse inference from his failure to file or pay such taxes. \nApplicant\u2019s sole remaining financial considerations security concern is his $10,000 \njudgment, which was adjudicated in September 2004. This $10,000 debt is substantial. \nHe has been continuously employed for four years, and his intermittent unemployment \ndoes not account for the failure to resolve or make any offers to make partial payments \nto resolve his sole, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor\u2019s failure \nto pursue garnishment or further enforcement action does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s lack \nof financial responsibility. Applicant has been aware of the security significance of this \ndelinquent SOR debt since he received the SOR in October 2008, and his efforts to \nresolve his delinquent debt are inadequate in that he should have attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments with the creditor or paid the creditor, and did not do so. \nFurther, he insists he will not pay the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a until after he has \naccumulated sufficient funds for litigating the validity of this debt, when he has already \nlost in court, resulting in a judgment for $10,000.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concern. I take this position based on the law, as set \nforth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of \nthe whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent \nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. \nFor the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant (Withdrawn) \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 34-year-old married woman with one child, age nine, and one stepchild, age 16. She has an associate\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering technology. Currently, she works for a defense contractor as a marine designer. Applicant owes creditors approximately 14,000 in delinquent debt. Her financial problems coincided with her 1997 wedding. She and her husband borrowed money from two creditors to finance the wedding reception, and purchase furniture for their new home (Exhibit 5 at 3). Shortly after the wedding, Applicant lost her job (Tr. 13). Both the wedding loan and the furniture loan, as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1f and 1.j, grew delinquent. Applicant was underemployed for several months, working a number of part-time jobs. By 1999, she had obtained a full-time job (Tr. 14). Later that year, she became pregnant. The pregnancy was difficult, requiring bed rest for the last month before her child\u2019s birth, and periodic hospitalizations. The child was born with serious health problems that required extensive medical treatment and hospitalization for both the child and Applicant (Exhibit 5 at 3). Approximately eight months elapsed before the medical problems of Applicant\u2019s child stabilized. Applicant was unable to work during this time, and lost her job.

Clearance is denied.\nOn October 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 13, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 12, 2009. On February 17, 2009, a Notice of\nHearing was issued originally scheduling the case for March 2, 2009. The hearing was\ncontinued because of inclement weather, and rescheduled for April 6, 2009. It was then\nMay 11, 2009\n\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.l are duplicates.\n1\n2\nheld as scheduled. At the hearing, I received six government exhibits, six Applicant\nexhibits, and the testimony of Applicant and her husband. The transcript was received\non April 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old married woman with one child, age nine, and one\nstepchild, age 16. She has an associate\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering\ntechnology. Currently, she works for a defense contractor as a marine designer.\nApplicant owes creditors approximately 14,000 in delinquent debt. Her financial\nproblems coincided with her 1997 wedding. She and her husband borrowed money\nfrom two creditors to finance the wedding reception, and purchase furniture for their new\nhome (Exhibit 5 at 3).  Shortly after the wedding, Applicant lost her job (Tr. 13). Both the\nwedding loan and the furniture loan, as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1f and 1.j, grew delinquent.\nApplicant was underemployed for several months, working a number of part-time\njobs. By 1999, she had obtained a full-time job (Tr. 14). Later that year, she became\npregnant. The pregnancy was difficult, requiring bed rest for the last month before her\nchild\u2019s birth, and periodic hospitalizations. The child was born with serious health\nproblems that required extensive medical treatment and hospitalization for both the child\nand Applicant (Exhibit 5 at 3).\nApproximately eight months elapsed before the medical problems of Applicant\u2019s\nchild stabilized. Applicant was unable to work during this time, and lost her job. Between\n2000 and 2002, she lacked health insurance (Exhibit 5 at 3). Her struggle to pay her\nmedical bills exacerbated her financial problems. By 2002, more debts grew delinquent\nincluding bills for her 1999 hospitalizations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e), and another credit card\nbill (SOR 1.c).1\nDuring this time, Applicant also fell behind on her car note. In 2003, her\nautomobile was repossessed, (Exhibit 4 at 15). In March 2003, a judgment for the\ndeficiency was entered against her in the amount of $4,572 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nIn 2004, after approximately three years of working for a temporary employment\nagency, Applicant began working for her current employer. After successfully\ncompleting an apprenticeship, she became a salaried employer in 2006 (Tr. 15).\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s income increased, she was unable to make any progress in\nsatisfying the SOR delinquencies. Shortly after her current employer hired her,\nApplicant\u2019s daughter had two surgeries to repair a cleft palate, and remove a nasal\ndeformity (Exhibit 5 at 2). Although Applicant had health insurance by this time, it did not\ncover all of the bills (Id.). Consequently, several more medical bills grew delinquent\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g -1.i).\n\n3\nAlso, in 2005, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law and his family moved into her home\n(Exhibit 5 at 3). For approximately seven months while her husband was unemployed,\nshe was supporting both her family and her brother-in-law\u2019s family solely on her income\n(Id.).\nIn May 2008, Applicant created a debt payment plan to satisfy a debt not listed\non the SOR (Exhibit E). Between May and November of 2008, she made monthly\npayments ranging between $29 and $80 (Id.). She did not complete the payment\nschedule, and continues to owe approximately $650.\nIn June 2008, Applicant wrote letters proposing payment plans to each of the\ncreditors listed in the SOR (Exhibit 4 at 11-15). In November 2008, she met with a\nfinancial counselor (Tr. 42). After the meeting, Applicant developed a payment plan\nwhich consolidated the individual plans set forth in her earlier correspondence to the\nSOR creditors (Exhibit D). Under the plan, she was to have satisfied all of the\ndelinquencies by June 2009. \nApplicant made one payment, consistent with the plan, satisfying a judgment\nowed to a local municipality (Exhibit F). She made no additional payments. She\nattributes her inability to execute the payment plan to an unexpectedly large increase in\nher utility bill (Tr. 42). \nApplicant maintains a budget (Tr. 40). She has approximately $585 of monthly\nafter-expense income. Currently, her mortgage payments are approximately two months\nbehind (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant satisfied SOR \u00b6 1(a) in June 2006. I conclude it no longer\nrepresents a security concern. The remaining delinquencies, however, trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by a series of family medical problems,\nand several episodes of underemployment. Once these problems stabilized, Applicant\nexperienced more setbacks including the relocation of her brother-in-law\u2019s family to her\nhome, and a rapid, unexpected increase in her utility bills. She responded by writing\ncreditors, consulting with a financial counselor, and developing payment plans. AG \u00b6\u00b6\n20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nAlthough Applicant deserves credit for confronting her delinquencies, her efforts,\nthus far, have been unsuccessful. Also, her mortgage payments have recently fallen\nbehind. Consequently, I cannot conclude that AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n5\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were caused by an extraordinary series of\nmisfortunes. She has attempted to get them under control by crafting a budget and\ndeveloping payment plans. Moreover, she deserves credit for obtaining her current job,\nand successfully completing its internship program.\nApplicant was unable, however, to adhere to her payment plans. Absent a\ndemonstrated track record of financial reform, future promises to pay debts have limited\nprobative value. Consequently, her financial problems remain a security concern\nregardless of the emotionally compelling circumstances surrounding their accrual. \nUpon considering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions together with the\nwhole person concept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial\nConsiderations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 23, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\n\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions was error and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was\nerror.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a psychologist.  He\nserved with the U.S. Army, retiring in the late 1990s.  After his retirement he worked for three\ndifferent companies.  He worked for three because he was not certain as to how long any one\ncontract would last.  Applicant was not able to manage the administrative requirements of his\nposition as a psychologist, especially preparing paperwork for submission to Medicare for payment.\nHe determined that the submissions he made contained \u201cbilling errors,\u201d (Decision at 3) i.e., claims\nfor services not rendered.  Beginning in the early 2000s, he experienced numerous health problems,\nincluding bladder and eye infections; a stroke, and a degenerative spine and joint disorder.

The court\nsentenced Applicant to five months confinement, followed by three years supervised release to\nprobation; restitution of $63,332.12 to Medicare; and a special assessment fine of $100.    \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of his job performance, as evidenced\nby the testimony of several witnesses at his hearing as well as by written letters of reference.\nHowever, his supporting evidence also states that Applicant is disorganized and does not always\nkeep adequate records.  He is also susceptible to stress.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s brief contends that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision did not consider\nsignificant contrary record evidence.  The Board will address this contention in the discussion below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n\nGovernment Exhibit 5, Criminal Docket, states that Applicant was prosecuted for Health Care Fraud, a\n1\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. 1347.  This statute reads as follows: \u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully executes, or attempts to\nexecute, a scheme or artifice (1) to defraud any health care benefit program; or (2) to obtain, by means of false of\nfraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or\ncontrol of, any health care benefit program, in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items\nor services, shall be fined . . . or imprisoned[.]\u201d See also Government Exhibit 3, Plea Agreement: \u201c[Applicant] admits\nthat he is in fact guilty of the offense charged in the indictment and acknowledges that he has been advised and does fully\nunderstand the nature of the charges to which the plea is offered[.]\u201d  \n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn holding in Applicant\u2019s favor, the Judge relied upon the length of time which had elapsed\nbetween the last criminal conduct and the close of the record; stress that Applicant experienced in\nperforming three jobs; and his excellent work record, to include psychological counseling for\nfamilies of deceased service members.  While these were matters the Judge was bound to consider,\nDepartment Counsel argues persuasively that the favorable decision is undermined by contrary\nrecord evidence.  For example, although Applicant pled guilty to defrauding the Federal\nGovernment, thereby admitting each element of the offense,  including its knowing and willful\n1\nnature, his presentation at the hearing included repeated denials that his conduct was deceitful.\n\nSee Tr. at 98: \u201cBecause I was so busy I allowed things to get very disjointed.  I still have to take responsibility\n2\nfor that; I put that in motion.  I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m not guilty of that, because I am.  I didn\u2019t have the criminal intent\u201d; Tr.\nat 107: \u201c. . . I just want you to understand this, that was the hardest thing I ever had to do, go into a court and say\nsomething that, basically . . . was saying I had the intent, which I never had intent to do.\u201d  Compare with Applicant\u2019s\nReply Brief, submitted after the close of the record in response to the Government\u2019s Appeal Brief.  Although generally\ndenying intent, the Brief does state that \u201cmy systemic, though occasional submission for services that I had clearly not\nprovided resulted in unforgivable acts in which I was reimbursed beyond what I was entitled to.  As a result, I violated\na sacred trust with my Government that I served practically all my life.\u201d  See also Applicants Exhibits A2,C1, C3, D,\nD2, and D9, which each offer an \u201cadministrative burden\u201d defense to the criminal allegations.      \nSee, e.g., Decision at 3: \u201cApplicant was unable to manage the administrative requirements (paperwork) of [his]\n3\nemployers, primarily the Medicare paperwork for the nursing homes . . . He tried to correct mistakes he discovered, but\nthe paperwork overwhelmed him . . . He first determined there were billing errors . . . but never asked for help or advice.\u201d\nThe Judge analogized Applicant\u2019s confusion regarding paperwork to pressure or coercion.  Decision at 7.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E2.32(b), which mitigates Criminal Conduct security concerns when \u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into\ncommitting the act . . .\u201d \nGovernment Exhibit 2, Interrogatories, includes a summary of Applicant\u2019s subject interview.  \u201cInvestigators\n4\n. . . found that sometimes a patient was billed but on the date billed [the] were not there or were already deceased.\u201d  See\nalso Tr. at 109: \u201cI had billing errors that went in for people that . . . were deceased.\u201d  \nRather, he attributed the behavior that led to his conviction to poor record keeping, stress, etc.2\nAlthough the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s case raised Guideline J security concerns, he does appear\nto have relied on this explanation in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.   The Judge does not\n3\nexplain why he finds this to be plausible, given record evidence that Applicant submitted Medicare\nclaims for, inter alia, providing psychological services to persons who, at the time of the alleged\ntreatment, were deceased.  Applicant\u2019s denial of a criminal mens rea could be interpreted by a\n4\nreasonable person as merely self serving.  When considered in light of other record evidence that (1)\nApplicant submitted false claims repeatedly over a four-year period; (2) he obtained over $63,000\nfrom Medicare as result of these claims; (3) he was still on probation at the close of the record; and\n(4) he had not finished making restitution at the close of the record, this denial significantly\nundermines the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation.  \nEven if Applicant had completed his sentence, his denial of criminal intent would\nsignificantly undercut his claims of rehabilitation.  It is inconsistent to contend that one has\ndemonstrated positive behavioral changes from a previous pattern of deceit while at the same time\ndenying that deceit ever occurred.  Moreover, the record does not demonstrate a connection between,\non one hand, the stress Applicant claimed to have experienced as result of illness and overwork and,\non the other, the misconduct for which he was convicted.  As a matter of common sense, repeated\nsubmissions of false claims for payment, committed over a four-year period, are unlikely to have\nresulted from inattention or confusion.  In addition, there is a paucity of record evidence in support\nof Applicant\u2019s claim that his alleged stressors would have diminished or impaired his capacity for\nspecific intent.  The record does not support a conclusion that these stressors amounted to pressure\nor coercion resulting in less culpability for the commission of a series of knowing and willful acts.\nThe record, viewed as a whole, does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of\npersuasion under the Egan standard.  The Judge\u2019s decision, viewed in its entirety, is contrary to the\nweight of the record evidence and is not sustainable.    \n\nOrder   \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Blank, Esq. Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on November 8,\n2004. On August 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under criminal conduct\n(Guideline H). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted his notarized response to the SOR on August 30, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2008, and the hearing was held on\nNovember 20, 2008. At the hearing, five exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. Five witnesses and\nApplicant testified. Applicant also submitted seven exhibits (AE A through AE G) in\nevidence without objection. AE A through AE F contain numerous character statements.\nFebruary 23, 2009\n\n2\nAE G contains a performance evaluation from March to October 1993, and an award for\nmeritorious, military service from February 1987 to February 1997. DOHA received a\ncopy of the transcript on December 8, 2008. After a thorough review of the pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains one allegation under the criminal conduct guideline. Applicant\nadmitted SOR 1.a. with an explanation. His explanation is that he was serving too many\nemployers and he neglected some of his responsibilities. \nApplicant, 54 years old, has been married to his wife for 31 years. He has three\nchildren. According to his security clearance form (GE 1), from September 1973 to\nJanuary 1977, Applicant was in the United States Army (USA) Active Reserves. In\nJanuary 1977, he went on active duty in the USA. He reached the rank of lieutenant\ncolonel when he was honorably discharged in February 1997. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s educational background, after receiving his Bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in 1976, and a graduate degree in management, he enrolled in a university in\nSeptember 1988 and graduated in June 1992 with a Ph.D. in Psychology (AE A3, vitae).\nIn 1992, Applicant was in the USA assigned to provide psychological\nassessments to soldiers who wanted to enter the special operations section of the USA.\nThe five witnesses that testified, and the numerous character statements in AE B\nthrough AE F, describe Applicant\u2019s favorable professional impact on supervisors and\nother officers within the military chain of command. The exhibits also contain\nobservations from present and former coworkers and supervisors in Applicant\u2019s civilian\nemployment, and also individuals who received counseling from Applicant over the\nyears. \nIn February 1997, Applicant was honorably discharged from his counseling\nposition in the USA. By September 2001, he was working as an independent contractor\n(as a psychologist) for three different companies. In 1997, Applicant began working for a\nlife care company performing services at nursing homes in state X. Applicant provided\nthe counseling services to senior citizens and billed company who billed the federal\nMedicare or Medicaid program (GE 2). \nIn 1998, Applicant was hired by witness C, president of a company primarily\ntasked with conducting the same psychological assessments he had been making in the\nmilitary. Shortly after September 11, 2001, Applicant started working for his third\nemployer, a disability determination service for state X (Tr. 94). Applicant explained that\nas an independent contractor, he contracted with the three employers because he never\nknew how long the contracts would last (AE A).\n\n3\nApplicant was unable to manage the administrative requirements (paperwork) of\nthree employers, primarily the Medicare paperwork for the nursing homes (Tr. 96-99).\nHe tried to correct mistakes he discovered, but the paperwork overwhelmed him (GE 2;\nTr. 97). He first determined there were billing errors, i.e. for services not rendered, in\nDecember 2001 (Tr. 113), but never asked for help or advice (Tr. 114). The\nadministrative problems took a toll on Applicant\u2019s health as well. He incurred a very\nserious bladder and eye condition in 2000, leading to surgery in November 2002, and\ntime off from work for a period of time beginning in December 2002 (GE 2). He had a\nstroke in February 2006, and he currently suffers from a degenerative spine and joint\ncondition disorder (AE A1). \nHe testified that as a result of the federal investigation into the billing errors\nbetween 2000 and February 2004 (Tr. 99, 112), he was indicted and pled guilty to\nfelony health care fraud (SOR 1.a.). Though he claimed it was never his intent to falsify\nclaims (Tr. 108), he admitted that he made false statements and was guilty of fraud\nagainst the federal government (Tr. 110; GE 2). Applicant estimated he made 62 billing\nerrors to Medicare, and should have sought a settlement much earlier in the criminal\nproceedings, but did not want to plead to a felony offense (AE A1).\nGE 5 (federal criminal docket of health fraud case from indictment to disposition)\nreflects that Applicant was indicted for health care fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347) on\nDecember 9, 2005. On August 28, 2006, a superceding indictment was filed adding 46\ncounts to the existing indictment. On January 16, 2007, Applicant entered a plea to the\noriginal indictment. The remaining charges in the superceding indictment appear to\nhave been dismissed (Id.). On April 17, 2007, Applicant was sentenced to 5 months\nfederal custody; followed by three years supervised release to probation, including five\nmonths home detention; restitution totaling $63,332.14 to Medicare; and, a special\nassessment fine of $100.00. Applicant satisfied all conditions except the remaining fine\nbalance, and the remaining period of probation. \nFive witnesses testified in Applicant\u2019s behalf. Witness A, who has become the\nchief of special operations for 28,000 USA troops in state Y, has known Applicant since\n1992 when Applicant was conducting psychological assessments for two USA units.\nWitness A also provided a character statement (AE D1). According to witness A,\nconducting assessments essentially means predicting whether an applicant will succeed\nin special operations in the USA (Tr. 24). Witness A has watched Applicant over the\nyears keep in contact with the family of fallen soldiers. He described a volunteer\nprogram Applicant began sometime after a major conflict in northern Africa in October\n1993 aimed at helping the grieving wives of fallen soldiers (Tr. 26-27). Applicant is still\nspending time with the program and those families, and subsequent participants of the\nprogram (AE A, AE B). See also, AE F containing the character statements of witness E\n(AE F2) and her son (AE F1). Witness E\u2019s testimony is addressed below. \nThough witness A has no first hand knowledge of Applicant\u2019s health care fraud,\nhe acknowledged that Applicant was prone to immerse himself so deeply in a project\nthat he would forget about other tasks (Tr. 29). Witness A recommends that Applicant\u2019s\n\n4\nsecurity clearance be restored. In describing the importance of experience in the special\noperation services, he stated:\nBecause in our business, in the Special Operations business, we have an\nequation that we like to use, it\u2019s capability is a function of training and\nexperience. Experience has an exponent, and the more experience that\nyou have in our community that in and of itself cannot be replaced easily.\nWe have a saying that Special Operations forces cannot be created\novernight or after an emergency occurs (Tr. 31).\nLater in witness A\u2019s testimony, he described Applicant\u2019s importance to the overall\nmission of psychological assessments. He stated:\nApplicant has all of [the experience and productivity]. He has a\ntremendous amount of experience. He can come in and do more in one\nday than a brand new psychologist can do in a month. He has that\nunderstanding, so he is absolutely invaluable to us to continue with us in\nthat capacity. \nThat\u2019s why  - - I\u2019m here more because I want to see our organization\nenhanced by the tremendous experience that he brings to it. I am also\nhere because I am a friend of his. But if I had to balance the equation, I\nam doing it for my organization, because I know what he brings to use and\nhow important he is to it (Tr. 32).\nWitness B, currently working as an administrator for witness C\u2019s company\n(psychological assessments) who also employs Applicant, has known him since\napproximately 1996 when Applicant was conducting assessments for the USA. Witness\nB indicated that Applicant is a good psychologist (Tr. 45) who has always been\ndisorganized administratively (Tr. 44). \nWitness C, the president of Applicant\u2019s employer (psychological assessments),\nworked with Applicant in the 1990s conducting assessments. In 1998, Applicant joined\nwitness C\u2019s company and still is employed there. Witness C sees in Applicant a very\nthorough psychologist who is among the best (Tr. 56), but who has a weakness in\norganization (Tr. 57). When asked whether Applicant has modified his responsibilities\nsince the criminal conviction, witness C said he had no personal knowledge (Tr. 68-69)\nsince without a security clearance, Applicant has not been able to work for him. They\ndid talk about the need to reduce work, and witness C believes Applicant understands\n(Id.). Unlike his employment situation between 2000 and 2004, Applicant currently\nworks for one employer (Tr. 116-118), a juvenile facility for troubled teenagers, and is\nnot in a position where he has to answer to several bosses at the same time (AE A).\nWitness C provided a statement concerning Applicant (AE D6). He does not\nbelieve Applicant is dishonest. Rather, witness C believes that Applicant\u2019s significant\ninvolvement in his work and volunteer services, e.g., counseling services for families of\n\n5\nfallen soldiers, counseling for law enforcement and community organizations,\nculminated in a stress-filled situation he could not manage (Id.). \nApplicant and witness D, a former coworker, met in 1990. They worked together\non psychological assessments from 2004 until disposition of the criminal case in April\n2007. Witness D considers Applicant to be very competent because he made the right\ncalls (Tr. 73) on psychological ratings of applicants who wanted special operation\nassignments. Though witness D has no personal knowledge of the criminal fraud case,\nApplicant\u2019s tendency toward brevity in keeping records has enabled witness D to\nunderstand why Applicant would not keep adequate records (Tr. 75-76). \nWitness E\u2019s husband was killed in a Middle Eastern conflict in 1991. Applicant\nhas provided grief counseling for her since 1992. She lives in the same town in state X\nas Applicant. Witness E and her son (who has also received counseling for the last 10\nyears) also wrote character statements appearing at AE F1 and AE F2. The reason why\nshe came to the hearing was to help Applicant regain his clearance. She believes he is\nan excellent counselor because his training and experience make his counseling more\neffective for the families of fallen and current soldiers who are assigned to special\noperations (Tr. 85-87). In pages 90 through 93 of the transcript, witness E testified\neloquently that the military needs more counselors like Applicant who possess a better\nmethodology to improve healing during the grieving process for families of fallen\nsoldiers. \nCharacter Evidence\nAE A3, Applicant\u2019s vitae, indicates he received 28 awards and certificates while\nin the military. See also, AE G. \nThe character statements, identifying professional and/or social contact with\nApplicant from a short time up to 25 years, uniformly praise Applicant\u2019s work as an\nassessor for special operations, but are aware of his lack of administrative organization.\nFor example, the first character statements in AE B and AE B1 confirm Applicant\u2019s\nqualifications in his work and commitment to the families of fallen soldiers, but noted his\nmismanagement was aggravated by his ballooning caseload. A chaplain, who worked\nwith Applicant from 2004 to 2007 on several psychological acceptance boards, believes\nApplicant to be one of the most compassionate persons in developing lifelong\nrelationships with families of soldiers who passed away in 1993 (AE D3). \nApplicant has a long-standing commitment to the military as demonstrated by his\nongoing dedication to the families of fallen victims. He has continued to serve the\nfamilies on a voluntary basis because there always will be a need to counsel the\nfamilies through their grief (AE A). Applicant continues to volunteer his psychological\nservices for law enforcement in his area, and has organized and sponsored 14 musical\nconcerts for children, besides being a motivational speaker in the juvenile court system\n(GE 2, AE F11, F 16). He also provided several valuable voluntary services to the\nnursing homes such as entertainment, transportation, and athletic activities (AE A, AE\n\n6\nF7). Applicant\u2019s psychology licenses for state X (where he lives and works) were\nreinstated in November 2007, along with his liability insurance (GE 2; Tr. 118). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. If residual\ndoubts remain concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation, those doubts will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n7\nAnalysis\nCriminal conduct (CC)\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nCC disqualifying condition (DC) 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) applies in Applicant\u2019s case. As a result of an investigation regarding\nApplicant\u2019s billing errors to Medicare, he pled guilty to health care fraud in January 2007\nbecause he was guilty. CC DC 31.d. (individual is currently on parole or probation) also\napplies as Applicant is still on probation.\nThree of the five mitigating conditions (MC) do apply in this case. CC mitigating\ncondition (MC) 32.a. (so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) clearly applies to\nthis case. Applicant\u2019s fraudulent activity ended in February 2004, (along with his\nemployment at the life care agency and disability agency) more than four years ago.\nApplicant no longer is employed in circumstances that contributed to his fraudulent\nactivity. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. \nCC MC 32.b. (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in his life) provides some mitigation and\nextenuation as Applicant could not manage the administrative paperwork. The stress\nand pressure no longer exists as his work in the juvenile facility does not require\nhandling the same kind of paperwork that he was handling with Medicare. \nCC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity development) provides substantial mitigation based on the persuasive\ncharacter evidence from past and present coworkers who are intimately familiar with\nApplicant\u2019s unswerving reputation for honesty, and who also know that he has trouble\nwith administrative tasks. The passage of more than four years weighs in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. \nApplicant\u2019s remorse is genuine. He has admitted that he made false statements\nand committed fraud. In confessing his guilt to the criminal fraud offense, I am satisfied\nthat Applicant is contrite. His good employment record and community involvement, i.e.\nhis continuing contributions throughout the criminal case to the families of fallen\ncomrades, constitutes convincing evidence that enables Applicant to overcome the fact\nthat he violated the law for about four years, and he will be on probation until April 2011.\nAccordingly, the CC guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n8\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was approximately 46 years old in 2000 when he began billing the\ngovernment (Medicare) for services not rendered. He did not end the criminal activity\nuntil February 2004. Though he showed some reticence during the hearing in accepting\nthe full scope of his illegal conduct, he admitted he committed fraud against the\ngovernment. Having listened closely to his testimony and watched him listen as his\nwitnesses testified about his virtues as well as his weaknesses, I firmly believe he\nunderstands he cannot handle the administrative tasks necessary for the Medicare\nclaims. I believe he also understands that working \nfor three employers\ncontemporaneously was creating stress that was too difficult to manage. The totality of\nthe circumstances informs me that Applicant has learned a painful lesson that has also\nresulted in serious health problems. After weighing the unfavorable information relating\nto \nthe \nfraudulent \nactivity \nagainst \nApplicant\u2019s \nlong \nhistory \nof \noutstanding\naccomplishments over the years in his professional career, both in the military and in\nprivate practice, I conclude the chances for recurrence of his criminal conduct are\nnonexistent. Accordingly, the CC guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal conduct, Guideline J):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response dated September 11, 2008, Applicant denied the Guideline H\nallegations, noting his disagreement with the wording of the allegations in terms of the\ndates and frequency of drug use. With regard to Guideline F, he admitted to 8 of the 14\nallegations raised. Applicant also requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative\nJudge. I was assigned the case on December 15, 2008. Department Counsel and\nJune 16, 2009\n\n Tr. 14-36.\n1\n At times, the transcript misidentifies the number of documents offered by Department Counsel and accepted\n2\ninto the record, see, e.g., pages 2 and 17. The proper number is six, as shown at page 14. \n Ex. R (Cover letter to submission package) contains a table of contents for documents designated as \u201ca\u201d\n3\nthrough \u201ck,\u201d but does not include any documents identified as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d. It does, however, include an additional\ndocument that has been accepted as Exhibit YY. There is no break in the facsimile transmission pagination\nto indicate an electronic transmission failure. Contrast Department Counsel\u2019s Memorandum for Administrative\nJudge Regarding Post Hearing Submissions, dated Feb. 19, 2009.\n The child\u2019s mother did not want to marry, wished to remain a single mother, and made no request for child\n4\nsupport. On his own initiative, Applicant \u201cwent and filed for child support against\u201d himself in order to provide\nassistance for their son. Tr. 113-114.\n Tr. 103. Applicant\u2019s mother once gave him a singular pill of one of her prescribed medications for anxiety\n5\nor tension (Xanax, a benzodiazepine). Tr. 114-115.\n2\nApplicant proposed a February 4, 2009, hearing, and a Notice of Hearing was issued to\nthat effect on January 16, 2009.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. An amended Answer to the SOR, dated\nJanuary 22, 2009, was received during the hearing. That Answer denied all allegations\nunder Guideline F. After a series of objections regarding potential evidentiary\nsubmissions,  testimony was given by Applicant and five witnesses for Applicant. The\n1\nwitnesses consisted of Applicant\u2019s wife, his employer, and three character witnesses.\nAccepted into the record as evidence were six documents from Department Counsel,\ndesignated as exhibits (Exs.) 1-6.  Applicant\u2019s proffer of 17 documents was accepted as\n2\nExs. A-Q. Applicant was given leave to supplement the record after the close of the\nhearing. A post-hearing package of submissions, dated February 19, 2009, was\nforwarded to Department Counsel. On March 2, 2009, I received a copy of that\nsubmission and a statement from Department Counsel that she had no objection to its\ncontents. Those documents were accepted into the record as Exs. R-BB and the record\nwas closed.  In the interim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on February 23, 2009.\n3\nBased upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old photo optic technician earning approximately $52,000\na year. He has worked for the same defense contractor for approximately two years. He\nearned an associate of arts degree in May 1999. Applicant has been married for a little\nover one year and the couple has an infant child. He also has a six-year-old child from a\nprevious relationship for whom he pays regular child support.4\nApplicant was born into a military family in which illegal drugs were not tolerated.5\nBeing home-schooled, he was not exposed to drugs in high school.

After three years, he decided to freelance in a capacity that permitted him\n6\nto work on sets at the request of productions shooting in his town. He soon moved to a\nmajor metropolitan city to do the same type of work. It was a \u201cglamorous lifestyle\u201d where\nhe met \u201cmovie stars and music stars, sports legends, political figures. . . .\u201d  When he\n7\nfirst encountered drugs on the set, he was appalled. He soon realized it \u201cwas always\naround.\u201d  Eventually, he developed relationships with many of his transient co-workers.\n8\nHe started to use cocaine in 2002 along with those peers, particularly on the longer\nshoots offering significant overtime pay. He would sometimes contribute $10 to a kitty\non the set for its purchase.  During this time, other drugs were tried with these peers. \n9\nIn 2006, Applicant met the woman he subsequently would marry in 2008. They\ndated for about six months before she took the relationship seriously.  She was\n10\nconcerned, however, with his lifestyle: \u201cHe worked when he got a job, so it was here\nand there. And he kind of lived the, I guess, a partyers [sic] lifestyle, drugs on the set.\u201d11\nShe began to recognize certain signs indicating when he had used drugs, noting he\nwould become \u201cvery detached, emotionally. He was sloppy. He didn\u2019t care about \u2013 \u2013\nmuch about his looks, about his household. Just kind of unfocused. Very into himself.\u201d12\nShe also learned to link the presence of certain phone numbers and associates with his\ndrug use. She noticed that his periods of drug use coincided with low finances.  She\n13\ndid not wish to continue in a deepening relationship with a drug abuser. She spoke with\nhim about his drug use, which she considered to be \u201cunnecessary.\u201d  They \u201chad very\n14\nserious conversations about him stopping and not ever starting the use of drugs ever\nagain and about what his future was.\u201d  He told her he would quit drugs, but he had a\n15\none-time relapse a few months later. Not wanting to jeopardize his relationship or to\nreturn to a drug-related lifestyle, he made the commitment to stop using drugs in\naround late February or early March 2007.  He left the city and returned to their\n16\nhometown. Since then, Applicant married his girlfriend, fathered the couple\u2019s daughter,\n\n Tr. 100.\n17\n Ex. B (Applicant\u2019s Notarized Affidavit, dated Jan. 22, 2009); Tr. 19; content affirmed elsewhere in testimony,\n18\ne.g., Tr. 100. Applicant\u2019s counsel stated that the format for this affidavit was taken from the DOHA website.\nTr. 19. It appears to be intended to create a document meeting the requirements of Guideline H mitigating\ncondition 2, AG \u00b6 26(b).\n Tr. 59, 53-54. 48, 43-46, 41-42.\n19\n Tr. 57.\n20\n Tr. 59.\n21\n Tr. 62-63.\n22\n Tr. 59-60.\n23\n Tr. 63.\n24\n Id.\n25\n Tr. 64.\n26\n Tr. 54; see also Tr. 42-43.\n27\n4\ndedicated himself to his current work, and became an active member of his wife\u2019s\nchurch. He also started coaching for the local Little League, where he currently serves\non the board of directors.\nApplicant admits his past drug use, but notes \u201cI have definitely left that lifestyle\nand left that environment.\u201d  Through testimony, he affirmed a notarized affidavit\n17\nsummarizing his past drug use and actions to quit drugs, and expressing his intent\nnever to return to drug abuse.  To the best of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s knowledge, as well as\n18\nthat of his boss and work peers, he has not used drugs since making the decision to\nquit abusing drugs.  Drug free, she describes Applicant as a \u201cwonderful husband\u201d and\n19\nthe \u201cbest father.\u201d  She will \u201cabsolutely not\u201d tolerate his return to drugs.  She is aware\n20\n21\nof the signs of his drug use and is proactive on noting any potential signs.  She\n22\nvehemently testified that should she see any sign of potential drug use by her husband,\nshe \u201cwould be furious and irate with him. [She] would probably pack up [their] daughter\nand leave him.\u201d  Since quitting drugs, his circle of friends has changed \u201cdramatically.\u201d\n23\n24\nHe no longer associates with his former photography and drug using connections.25\nTheir current circle of friends include contacts from Applicant\u2019s current place of\nemployment, local Little League staff, and friends of Applicant\u2019s wife: \u201cHe likes all my\nfriends, and I choose good people to hang out with and associate with.\u201d  \n26\nAt work, Applicant\u2019s supervisor has noticed no sign of drug use by Applicant,\nnoting a person in Applicant\u2019s position could not exercise the requisite expertise and\naccuracy to execute Applicant\u2019s job functions.

She noted that Applicant has \u201cchanged his\nlifestyle significantly and has been clean for the past two years. He displays emotional\nmaturity and behaves responsibly. He has shown he is committed to family values and\nsocial responsibility.\u201d  She concluded that Applicant \u201chas demonstrated that he has\n29\novercome his past issues with substance abuse,\u201d noting he is a \u201cproductive, reliable,\nand responsible person and will continue to serve the community in an even greater\ncapacity if given the opportunity.\u201d  Drug test reports executed on October 20, 2008,\n30\nJanuary 19, 2009, and February 3, 2009, reflect certifications by a medical doctor as\nhaving \u201cnegative\u201d results for amphetamines, cannabinoids (including marijuana),\ncocaine (including crack cocaine), opiates (including heroin), and phencyclidine.31\nApplicant\u2019s employer maintains a Drug Free Workplace policy and Applicant is subject\nto a random drug testing policy.  It reserves the right to conduct drug/alcohol screening\n32\n\u201cfollowing supervisory or employee observation of suspected drug or alcohol use; any\nother event that could be reasonably construed to involve drug/alcohol abuse. . . .\u201d  \n33\nApplicant admits he has tried or used cocaine, crack, heroin, and marijuana in\nthe past. The record reflects inconsistencies, however, with regard to the time and\nfrequency of his drug use. Applicant disclosed his past drug use in his security\napplication. He was then interviewed on the matter on October 5, 2007, which was the\nsource for the SOR allegations. Applicant\u2019s subsequent responses disclosed more\nspecific responses, resulting in inconsistencies in the record between the interview\nnotes, Applicant\u2019s initial SOR response, and his amended response with regard to\ncocaine use. Applicant credibly testified in terms of dates and frequency roughly\nequivalent with the information contained in the amended response.34\n\n In amending his Answer, Applicant wrote that the SOR sources are based on \u201cpartial quote[s] from an\n35\nOctober 5 , 2007, interview with government officials\u201d which contain \u201cmaterial\u201d omissions.\nth\n Contrast Tr. 74-76.\n36\n No frequency is given with regard to crack, heroin, or marijuana use. Consequently, there is no material\n37\ninconsistency with regard to the frequency with which Applicant abused these drugs.\n Consistent with his original SOR Response, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing was that he only used\n38\nmarijuana through 2005.\n6\nSOR\nSOR Response\nAmended SOR\nResponse35\nCOCAINE - used \u201cup to\nfive times per month, from\nabout 2002 to at least\nMarch 2007\u201d36\n\u201cused cocaine approxi-\nmately 1 to 2 times per\nmonth, but not every\nmonth, from 2002 to 2005,\napproximately 2 to 5 times\nper month from 2005 to\u201d\nMarch 2007\nused cocaine from about\n2002 \u201cand continued to do\nso once a month or every\nother month until 2005\nwhen his cocaine use\nincreased to 2-5 times\neach month until 03/2007\u201d\nCRACK - used \u201cfrom 2005\nto at least 2006\u201d37\n\u201cused crack approximately\n3 or 4 times in the Fall of\n2005, a couple of times\n(approximately two)\nbetween 2005 and 2006\nand discontinued use\nthereafter\u201d\n\u201csmoked crack between 3\nand 4 times in the fall of\n2005 and again a couple\nof times between 2005\nand 2006\u201d\nHEROIN - \u201cin at least the\nspring and summer of\n2005\u201d\n\u201cused heroin two or three\ntimes in the Spring and\nSummer of 2005, and\ndiscontinued use\nthereafter\u201d\nused \u201cheroin as an\nexperiment [2 or 3 times]\nin the spring and summer\nof 2005\u201d\nMARIJUANA - \u201cfrom 2002\nto at least 2007\u201d\nused marijuana \u201ca total of\nthree times between 2002\nand 2005 and\ndiscontinued thereafter\u201d\nused \u201cmarijuana a total of\n3 times between 2002 and\n2007\u201d38\nAll these dates are approximate, based not on a record, but on personal estimates. \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant admitted having had delinquent\naccounts in the past or at the time of his application. Stating that his answer was based\non estimates, he enumerated five accounts of which he then had knowledge. This\nincluded a possible IRS balance from an estimated time frame of April 2003, although\nhe stated \u201cit is my intention to find out how much I might owe and pay it off.\u201d (Emphasis\n\n See, e.g., Tr. 87.\n39\n In closing, Department Counsel conceded that the Government\u2019s \u201cprimary concern\u201d is Guideline H. Tr. 124.\n40\n At hearing, Applicant testified this obligation belonged to a former roommate and the matter was being\n41\nexamined. Ex. P (Debt status, dated Feb. 4, 2009). After hearing, Applicant wrote that he was submitting as\nenclosure a) a document showing the $379 balance was settled for $126. As noted, supra, the submission\ncontained no such document. However, in Ex. 5 (Credit report, dated Aug. 16, 2007), the entry notes that the\naccount was reported and has a date of last activity shown as September 2002, less than seven years ago.\nThe record and the Applicant have demonstrated that none of the subsequent credit reports from 2008 or\n2009 reference either that collection agent or underlying creditor. Consequently, its deletion can be assumed\nto be the result of satisfaction or removal for error, not because the entry was stale.\n Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission indicates that enclosure b) shows satisfaction of this obligation, but\n42\nthere is no corresponding document noting either that amount or the referenced collection agent. Applicant\u2019s\nEx. Q (Credit report, dated Feb. 4, 2009), however, reflects it remains on his credit report as unpaid.\n A receipt showing a zero balance for account number containing \u201352066 corresponds to its entry in  Ex. 5\n43\n(Credit report, dated Aug. 16, 2007) for an account including that same numerical sequence. \n Ex. T reflects a collection effort for $5,536 with a current balance of zero.\n44\n7\nin the original). He was unaware of some of the delinquent accounts on his credit\nreport.39\nAt issue in the SOR are the following 14 delinquent debts, as depicted as entries\nin credit reports dated August 16, 2007, and June 23, 2008. They include balances for\nimmediate medical care, most of which were initially attributed directly to Applicant\nbefore his employer processed his paperwork for company health insurance coverage.\nMost of the remainder of the debts were originally incurred when Applicant was\nfreelancing, between 2002 and 2006. Of those debts, seven are now paid in full\n(approximately $9,150), two have been paid or otherwise deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit\nreport within seven years (approximately $2,600), the status of two accounts remains\nunknown (approximately $700), two debts were deleted as error (approximately $575)\nand an IRS liability was not substantiated.  The accounts at issue are as follows:\n40\nCREDITOR/SOR\nALLEGATION #\nSTATUS\nSOURCE\n1.a - Telecommunication\ncollection ($379)\nDeleted from credit report\nEx. P, Ex.

He testified he had disputed this account. Applicant\u2019s 2009 credit report,\nEx. Q, and the Government\u2019s 2008 credit report, Ex. 3, no longer reflect the entry as derogatory information.\n Ex. U shows telecommunication account including account numbers \u201370075 with a zero balance.\n46\n This account was not noted in the Government\u2019s Ex. 5 (Credit report, dated Aug. 16, 2007) or Ex. 3 (Credit\n47\nreport, dated Jan. 29, 2009, nor does it appear in Applicant\u2019s Ex. Q (Credit report, dated Feb. 4, 2009. It only\nappears in the intervening Government Ex. 4 (Credit report, dated Jun. 23, 2008) for an account with a date\nof last activity in 2007. That credit report also notes that Applicant disputed this entry. Inasmuch as seven\nyears have not passed, it may be assumed that its deletion from subsequent credit reports proffered by both\nthe Government and Applicant indicates its satisfaction or deletion as error.\n This debt is first reflected in Applicant\u2019s June 2008 credit report, Ex. 4, where it is noted as having been\n48\nlisted in January 2008. It does not appear in his 2007 credit report, nor does it appear in any of the subsequent\ncredit reports. Consequently, it can be concluded the account has been paid or deleted as error. \n After hearing, Applicant submitted Ex. AA (Collection statement, undated) indicating payment for this exact\n49\nbalance was made to this collection agent for account including the numerical sequence of \u201315431 at some\ntime in 2007. The credit report entry reflects that same amount and account number sequence.\n Ex. BB (Collection statement, dated Oct. 21, 2008) notes that account containing the number sequence\n50\n\u201353906 now has a zero balance. That is the same account noted in the June 2008 credit report (Ex. 4).\n This obligation was not noted in any of the credit reports submitted by either party.\n51\n Based on Applicant\u2019s security clearance estimate that he \u201cmight\u201d owe a balance to the IRS from an\n52\nestimated time period of April 2003, the SOR alleges an IRS indebtedness incurred in 2003. Applicant notes\nhe has made inquiries as to whether he has a balance owed. He wrote \u201cThe IRS does not have me on record\nas owing them money.\u201d He also notes it is not in his credit reports. He testified that after investigation, he does\nnot now believe he owes any taxes. Tr. 94, 123.

After paying rent,\n53\nutilities, cable, internet, car insurance, phone service, his wife\u2019s student loan, and a\n10% tithe to his church, he has a remainder of approximately $621 per month to save\nor spend on other expenses. He is now timely on his payment of bills.  While providing\n54\nfor his family, their needs are not extravagant. The majority of their social time is spent\nwith friends from their church or the Little League, or entertaining office associates and\nfriends at home. At work, he is considered a valuable asset and has received\nrecognition for his performance and work ethic.  He is particularly noted for his\n55\nprecision with intricate and delicate optic materials.  He has been recognized for taking\n56\nover one of his company\u2019s operations and nearly doubling its success rate in a very\nshort period.57\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n58\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n59\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n59\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n60\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n61\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n62\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n63\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I agree the following adjudicative\nguidelines are the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement. The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse\nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions\nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs,\nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants,\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 24.\n64\n AG \u00b6 18.\n65\n11\nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug\nabuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction.  \n64\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or an inability to\nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of\nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.65\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGUIDELINE H\nApplicant admits he used various illegal drugs with varying frequency between\n2002 and February 2007. He also once took a Xanax for anxiety or tension, which was\ngiven to him by his mother. Occasionally, Applicant also contributed to the purchase of\ndrugs on the set of his assignments while freelancing in a major city. Consequently,\nboth Drug Involvement (DI) Disqualifying Conditions (DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse)\nand AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution) apply. With disqualifying conditions thus established, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns.\nApplicant left a regimented upbringing and eventually found himself in a big city\nworking in what seemed to be a unique and glamorous environment. Drug use he\ninitially found surprising and antithetical to the work soon seemed as commonplace as\nthe celebrities he routinely encountered. He succumbed to its use as he became closer\nto his drug using associates and their cosmopolitan culture, as well as the possibility of\ndouble pay for overtime. Since that time, he has sworn off drugs, moved back to his\nhometown, married a strong willed woman who is adamantly against drug use and his\nformer lifestyle/profession, changed his circle of friends, became a father, and\nrefocused himself on his work and hometown community involvement. Additionally,\nalthough the extent of her examination is unknown, he was given a highly favorable\nassessment by a licensed counselor. Such assessment is due some degree of\nconsideration. Applicant\u2019s conduct and the unique environment in which he used drugs\nstands in large contrast to the passionate resolve and strong character he now displays\nin his more recent situation. Given his return home, his family\u2019s and professional peers\u2019\ninfluence and support, and Applicant\u2019s personal resolve, there is no reason to believe\nhe would give up his refocused life and revert to drug use. Under such facts, DI\n\n12\nMitigating Condition (MC) AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\napplies. \nCocaine was Applicant\u2019s drug of choice, with lesser use of crack, marijuana, and\nsome experimentation with heroin. Consequently, DI MC AG \u00b6 26(c) (abuse of\nprescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs\nwere prescribed, and abuse has since ended) does not apply. Similarly, although\nApplicant was given a favorable analysis by a licensed counselor, he did not undergo a\nprescribed drug treatment program. DI MC AG \u00b6 26(d) (satisfactory completion of a\nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and\naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional) does not apply.\nWith his former girlfriend\u2019s help, Applicant realized how far he had deviated from\nhis initial goals and upbringing while living what appeared to be a sophisticated lifestyle.\nWanting to return to his original professional goals and to not lose his girlfriend, he quit\ndrugs and the freelance life in his former milieu, ceased contact with those who use\ndrugs, moved back home from the city, found a professional niche that was both\nchallenging and enjoyable, wooed and won his bride, completely changed his circle of\nfriends, became a \u201cwonderful husband\u201d and \u201cthe best father,\u201d joined a church, and\nbecome civically involved. He has thrived in this new environment and demonstrated a\ncomplete turnaround in his lifestyle. While this nearly two and one half year period may\nbe argued to be recent, recency is not an explicit bar to mitigation under this guideline.\nUnder facts and circumstances unique to this particular case, Applicant\u2019s period of\nabstinence is an appropriate period given the personal transformation and showing of\nresolve he has demonstrated in that time. This conclusion is shared by a licensed\ncounselor as well as his wife and peers. All of these facts bolster the fact he has\ncertified and repeatedly stated his firm intent not to return to drugs in the future. Such\nfacts raise sections (1), (2), and (3) of DI MC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a documented intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence). \nWith the aid of counsel, Applicant signed a statement reflecting he is aware of\nDepartment of Defense drug policies and understands future drug use could result in\nthe loss of a security clearance and his current employment. In it, he also stated that he\nhas no intention of ever resuming illegal drug use. This notarized statement of intent not\nto resume drug use was obviously executed as an attempt to invoke section (4) of DI\nMC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation). While technically it lacks an automatic revocation clause, its basis on a\nDOHA example to meet this mitigating condition gives sufficient basis to conclude this\ncondition is met in part, with its technical deficiency duly noted. \nSince giving up drugs in February 2007, Applicant has dramatically turned his life\naround from freelancing bachelor with a drug habit to a family man and settled\n\n Such character traits strike to the core of the concerns underlying Guideline H. See AG \u00b6 24. \n66\n13\nprofessional who is spiritually and civically active. His professional success and obvious\ndevotion to his family, combined with the persuasive testimony of both his peers and his\nwife, do not reflect a man likely to return to drugs. Indeed, in light of the facts and\ntestimony, the Applicant at present is one possessing the requisite reliability,\ntrustworthiness, maturity, judgment, and willingness to comply with laws and rules\nexpected of any individual seeking a security clearance.  Guideline H security concerns\n66\nare mitigated.\nGUIDELINE F\nApplicant was aware of some, but not all, of the derogatory information\ncontained in his credit reports when he executed his security clearance application.\nWhile many of the enumerated accounts in the SOR were previously paid or entered in\nerror, several entries reflected genuinely delinquent accounts. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. With such conditions raised, the burden is placed on Applicant to overcome the\ncase against him and mitigate security concerns. \nNearly half of the accounts at issue were for immediate medical care occurring\nbefore Applicant\u2019s current employer had processed his medical insurance application.\nEvidence was provided showing all but a $67 balance of that debt has been addressed.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.\nThe accounts at issue were mainly created between 2002 and 2007. Since that\ntime, Applicant has given up drugs and left his former lifestyle, factors his wife suggests\nused to impact his finances. Today, he lives within budget. More than one delinquent\naccount, however, remains to be either paid or further investigated. While Applicant has\nacted responsibly since learning of these accounts, Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not\napply.\nOf those delinquent debts cited in the SOR, seven are now paid in full, two have\nbeen paid or otherwise deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report within seven years, the\ncurrent status of two accounts remains unknown, two debts were deleted as error, and\nthe alleged IRS debt was credibly explained as based on error. Applicant is still\npursuing information on his two unknown and unresolved debts, involving a\nmanageable amount of, at most, about $700. Given these facts, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the\n\n See, e.g., Tr. 124.\n67\n Applicant also consumed a Xanax given to him by his mother from her personal prescription. \n68\n14\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) applies. \nApplicant disclosed what he thought were all of his delinquent accounts,\nincluding one which ultimately proved to be nonexistent. He successfully disputed some\naccounts and paid others. Only two accounts, representing no more than $700, remain\nat issue. He is continuing to pursue their resolution. Otherwise, Applicant is living drug-\nfree, has stable employment, and is providing for his family within his means. Given\nApplicant\u2019s testimony and evidence with regard to the resolution of the accounts at\nissue, I conclude financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a credible and focused young man who has the\nsupport of his equally credible witnesses. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s demeanor and testimony\nwas particularly credible, often critical and always candid. With regard to Guideline F,\nApplicant has made significant strides in addressing his delinquent debt, is committed\nto stying solvent and saving for his family\u2019s future, and is now living within his means.\nHe has also removed himself from the temptations of his former milieu. Applicant\nprovided persuasive evidence that his financial situation is now under control and that\nhe is currently able to save for future contingencies. Remaining are concerns regarding\nGuideline H.  \n67\nSpeaking against Applicant are his selection of drugs and both the length and\nfrequency of his drug use. In particular, cocaine, crack, and heroin are notoriously\n\u201chardcore\u201d drugs.  As noted by Department Counsel, they are particularly addictive.\n68\nDespite his seemingly regular use of cocaine over a five year period and his more\n\n15\nsporadic use of other drugs during a shorter time span, however, there is no indication\nthat he developed an addiction so nagging as to prevent him from quitting drugs\nsuccessfully for nearly two and a half years, turning his life completely around, and\nsuccessfully engaging in highly intricate work. But for his past drug use, today\u2019s\nApplicant appears to be a model father, employee, and rising community leader.   \nMany more facts speak for Applicant. When persuaded by his girlfriend to give\nup  his freelancing lifestyle in a big city, he did so. His sole relapse was shortly after he\nmoved home, on his one visit back to his old environment before ultimately giving up\ndrugs for good in February or March of 2007. While that occasion triggered a relapse, it\nwas also a learning experience. He has demonstrated that his nearly two and a half\nyears of abstinence was an appropriate period inasmuch as he has accomplished\nconsiderably more than most similarly situated individuals. He has matured and\ndemonstrated his ability to remain drug-free and thrive. Eschewing contact with his old\nassociates, residence, and lifestyle, he has built a new career and family life in his\nhometown community. Unlike the situation with the mother of his first child, his wife is\nas committed to their marriage, their family, and their current lifestyle, as he is. As a\ncouple, they are mutually supportive. Similarly, his employer is highly supportive of\nApplicant, a valued and devoted employee capable of delicate and precise work. He\nhas become involved in a local church and is active in his community. He is lauded for\nhis professionalism on the job and for his community leadership working with children.\nHe is surrounded by a positive and supportive network of family, associates, and\nfriends, for which he appears properly appreciative. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony revealed a man highly content with his current life and who\nis thoroughly resolved about staying drug-free. There is no indication that he would\nsacrifice his current life, work, or lifestyle, nor is there any indication he would ever\nconsider returning to drugs or his former milieu. In light of such facts, and given his\ndemonstrated growth and abstinence, no residual doubts remain. With drug\ninvolvement security concerns mitigated, clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n16\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 31, 2008. The\nSOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the\nMay 8, 2009 \n\n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n2\nherein. \n2\naction. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based\non a history of financial problems.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on February 17, 2009,\nand he elected a decision without a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided\nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn March 16, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant and received by him on April 21,\n2\n2009. He replied to the FORM within the allowed 30-day period, and his reply consists\nof a one-page letter and a one-page attachment bearing the photocopies of two checks.\nDepartment counsel raised no objections, and so those matters are admitted as Exhibit\nA. The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes six creditors the total\nsum of approximately $14,471 in delinquent debt. His Answer to the SOR was mixed.\nHe admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, and he included documentation\nto show he had paid the debts in 1.a and 1.f. Also, he stated that he was making $100\nmonthly payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\nand 1.c. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old network engineer. He has worked for his current\nemployer since 2006. He completed a security-clearance application in October 2007\n(Exhibit 4). This document shows he was self-employed in telecommunications from\nabout August 2003 to December 2006, he worked as a technician for a communications\ncompany from February 1999 to August 2003, and he listed no period of\nunemployment. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1997 (Exhibit 6), and his second\nmarriage ended in divorce in 2004 (Exhibit 4).\nApplicant has a well-established history of financial problems dating back to his\nfirst marriage. Applicant incurred substantial debt as a result of the divorce. He filed for\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy in about October 1998 and he received a discharge in about\nFebruary 1999 (Exhibits 8 and 9). He estimates that he had about $20,000 in liabilities\n(Exhibit 6). \nThe SOR does not allege the bankruptcy but it does allege six delinquent debts,\neach of which is discussed below. The debts alleged in the SOR are established by the\ninformation in multiple credit reports (Exhibits 7, 8, and 9). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n3\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $63 collection account based on a returned check. It was paid\nin full in February 2009 (Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $159 collection account based on a telephone account. In his\nresponse to the FORM, Applicant denied this allegation and claimed that he had a\ncurrent account with the same telephone company (Exhibit A). He did not, however,\nprovide any documentation (for example, an account statement) to support his claim.\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $911 collection account based on an account with a bank. In\nhis response to the FORM, Applicant denied this allegation and claimed that he has a\ncurrent account with the same bank (Exhibit A). He did not, however, provide any\ndocumentation to support his claim.\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a $8,242 debt based on a repossession. In his response to the\nFORM, Applicant stated that he tried to contact the creditor and they said the account\nwas sold or written off (Exhibit A). In his December 2007 background interview,\nApplicant explained the debt stemmed from the repossession of his 1999 Dodge truck\npurchased in about December 2004 with a monthly payment of $550 (Exhibit 6). He fell\nbehind on the payment schedule and the truck was repossessed. He stated that he had\nnot been contacted regarding a balance owed and said he would contact them in an\neffort to arrange a repayment plan. He did not provide any documentation on this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $4,078 charged-off debt based on a bank loan. Reading the\nthree credit reports and his interview together, this debt stems from a personal loan of\nabout $12,000 Applicant obtained from a bank to buy two snowmobiles and a trailer\n(Exhibits 6\u20139). In time, he fell behind on the payment schedule and the bank took\ncollection action against Applicant via a lawsuit on the debt. The bank obtained a\njudgment against Applicant in the amount of $7,696 in September 2007.  He is paying\nthe judgment off with $100 monthly payments, and as of April 2008, the balance was\n$7,530 (Exhibit 5\u2013Attachment B). He did not provide any current documentation (from\n2009) on this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $1,018 state tax lien that was filed against Applicant in about\nAugust 2005. It was paid in full in February 2009 (Exhibit A). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\n\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n18\n6\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and the most pertinent here is MC 4,\nwhich concerns initiating a good-faith effort to repay.  \nIn summary, Applicant resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f, he disputes,\nwithout documentation, the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, and he has not resolved the debts in\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, which total approximately $15,000 stemming from a repossession of a\ntruck and a judgment taken on a bank loan. Given these circumstances, Applicant does\nnot receive credit under MC 4 because his efforts are not sufficient. The vast majority of\nthe debt remains unresolved and Applicant did not provide sufficient information to\nsupport his claims that he disputes two of the debts. \nAlso, MC 2 received due consideration based on Applicant\u2019s two divorces. But it\ndoes not apply because Applicant did not present sufficient evidence showing that he\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate a\nperson\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the person\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n18\nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole and giving it due consideration\nunder the whole-person concept, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s well-established history of financial problems, to include his\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, and further conclude that it is simply too soon to tell if Applicant\nwill be able to put his financial house in good order. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not\nsufficient to overcome the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden\n\n7\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.    \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 10, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On October 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \n \n1  Item 4. \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nApril 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant\u2019s undated Response to SOR allegations was received by DOHA, on \nDecember 29, 2008, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 26, \n2009, was provided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 The case was assigned to me \non March 23, 2009. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \n \nIn the Government\u2019s FORM and pursuant to Items 10 and 17 of the Additional \nProcedural Guidance of the Directive, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nby adding: \n \n \n1.t. You are indebted to CNAC/TX on an account that is delinquent in the \napproximate amount of $6,781. As of July 10, 2008, this debt had not been paid. \n \n \n1.u. You are indebted to MAC on an account that is in collection in the \napproximate amount of $4,545. As of July 10, 2008, this debt had not been paid. \n \n \n1.v. You are indebted to Military A on an account that is charged off in the \napproximate amount of $3,627. As of July 10, 2008, this debt had not been paid. \n \n \n1.w. You are indebted to Pioneer Milit on an account that is charged off in the \napproximate amount of $7,700. As of July 10, 2008, this debt has not been paid. \n \n \nApplicant did not respond to Department Counsel\u2019s amendment and FORM and \ndid not admit or deny the additional allegations as requested. I view Applicant\u2019s failure \nto respond as a waiver and grant Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR.  \n \n \n \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3 The DOHA transmittal letter is dated January 26, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on February 2, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had \n30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.h., 1.j., 1.o., and \n1.p. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.b., 1.e. \u2013 1.g., 1.i., 1.k. \u2013 1.m., and 1.q. \u2013 1.s. He did not \nanswer \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.n. Additionally, he did not answer the allegations included in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.t. \u2013 1.w. in the Motion to Amend SOR, supra. His admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old defense contractor employee, who has worked for his \ncompany since February 2007.4 The only information the FORM contains regarding his \neducational background is that he attended a graduate school of theology from \nSeptember 2002 to June 2005. He was married in September 1992 and separated in \nJuly 2001. He refers to \u201cgoing through a divorce\u201d in his Answer, but does not mention a \nfinal divorce date.5 He served in the U.S. Army from September 1992 to December \n2004 and was discharged as an E-5. He held a security clearance at the secret level \nwhile in the Army. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial problems and \nincluded the review of his September 2007 and April 2008 credit reports.6 Additionally, it \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s two July 2008 Responses to DOHA interrogatories.7  \n \nApplicant has delinquent SOR debts approximating $60,700. In addition to the \nadmissions contained in his Answer to the SOR, the debts are independently supported \nby Applicant\u2019s eQIP, and his November 2007 and August 2008 credit reports.8 As noted \nabove, Applicant\u2019s Answer denied he owes the debts listed supra; however, he has \nprovided no credible evidence to prove or support his assertions.  \n \nThe DOHA interrogatories asked Applicant (in part) to explain and/or document \nthe status of delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.w. Applicant either did not \nprovide a response or indicated the debt was an \u201cerror.\u201d He concluded: \n \nWhile being interviewed by your Agent, I found out my credit history is \nvery incorrect. I have hired an attorney to investigate and correct the \nabove credit inquiries. There are many duplicate entries on my credit \nreport. Most are not valid entries. I have included phone numbers to [credit \n \n4 Item 4 (e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n5 Item 3. \n \n6 Items 5 and 6. \n \n7 Items 7 and 8. \n \n8 Items 7 and 8. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nrepair company]. The company I hired to fix my credit. Also, I\u2019m still in \nprocess of a divorce.9 \n \nApplicant did not provide any documentation to substantiate his claim. \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM failed to address any of his delinquent debts. He \nfailed to provide any information as to how he acquired the debts, why they became \ndelinquent, what efforts he took, if any, to resolve his debts, and what measures he has \ntaken to avoid similar financial problems in the future. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d10 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \n \n9 Item 7. \n \n10 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).11 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response.  \n \n \n11 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has submitted no documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the debts alleged in SOR, that he has attempted to contact \nthose or other creditors to settle or resolve the debts alleged in the SOR, or that he is \nreceiving counseling or has ever received financial counseling to assist him with his \nfinancial difficulties.  \n \nApplicant also has not produced convincing evidence showing that he acted \nresponsibly or prudently in managing his financial affairs over several years, and it is \nclear from the record evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not recent, are \nnot isolated, and appear likely to be a continuing concern in the future.  \n \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Considering the record as a whole, and absent any mitigating evidence from the \nApplicant, I conclude his SOR debts, totaling about $60,700 are still valid, delinquent \ndebts, and that Applicant is responsible for them.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,12 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to establish \nthe applicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Based on his security \nclearance application, Applicant has held his present job as a contractor since February \n2007.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nhe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control \nof his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. He has not carried his \nburden of proving his financial responsibility. His overall financial behavior casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment as a Government contract employee weighs in \nhis favor.  Aside from his delinquent debt (which is a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a \nlaw-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt that has been ongoing. Applicant has submitted \n \n12  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nno documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \ndebts, that he has attempted to contact those or other creditors to settle or resolve \ndebts alleged in the SOR, or that he is receiving or has ever received financial \ncounseling to assist him with his financial difficulties. Applicant has not produced \nconvincing evidence showing that he has acted responsibly or prudently in managing \nhis financial affairs over several years, and it is clear from the record that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are not recent isolated, and appear likely to be a continuing concern \nin the future. Accordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns caused by \nthe financial considerations in his case. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.w.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all of the allegations under Guideline F. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 33-years-old and has been a warehouse technician for a defense contractor for about two years. He is not married but has a child. He and the child's mother had joint custody but he now has shared custody and pays child support of $350 per month. He is current on his child support payments (Tr. 23-24). He was working towards a degree in psychology (Tr. 31-32; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated June 15, 2007). He does not have an extravagant life style. He rents an old family house from his father and drives a 15-year-old car. Applicant's monthly net income is $1,276 with monthly recurring expenses of $1,150, including his child support payments. He has approximately $100 in discretionary funds each month (Tr. 28-31; App. Ex. D, Statement of Earnings, dated October 12, 2008; App. Ex. G, Statement of Earnings, dated March 1, 2009).

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) on June 15, \n2007.  On November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 3, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 9, 2009.  He admitted all \ntwenty-five allegations of delinquent debt under Guideline F.  He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nFebruary 10, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on February 24, 2009, for a hearing on March 20, 2009.  I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered five exhibits, marked \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ngovernment exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received without objection.  \nApplicant submitted four documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through D, \nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The record \nwas left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted \nsix additional documents marked App. Ex. E through J.  The government did not object \nto the admission of the documents (See Gov. Ex. 6, Department Counsel Letter, dated \nDecember 9, 2008).  The documents were admitted into the record.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 30, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted all of the allegations under \nGuideline F.  He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nApplicant is 33-years-old and has been a warehouse technician for a defense \ncontractor for about two years.  He is not married but has a child.  He and the child's \nmother had joint custody but he now has shared custody and pays child support of $350 \nper month.  He is current on his child support payments (Tr. 23-24).  He was working \ntowards a degree in psychology (Tr. 31-32; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated June 15, 2007).  \nHe does not have an extravagant life style.  He rents an old family house from his father \nand drives a 15-year-old car.  Applicant's monthly net income is $1,276 with monthly \nrecurring expenses of $1,150, including his child support payments.  He has \napproximately $100 in discretionary funds each month (Tr. 28-31; App. Ex. D, \nStatement of Earnings, dated October 12, 2008; App. Ex. G, Statement of Earnings, \ndated March 1, 2009).   \n \nCredit reports show that Applicant had the following delinquent debts; medical \ncollection accounts for $254 (SOR 1.a), $842 (SOR 1.b), $16 (SOR 1.c), $20(SOR 1.d), \n$14 (SOR 1.e), $20 (SOR 1.f), $20 (SOR 1.g), $36 (SOR 1.h), $434 (SOR 1.i), $38 \n(SOR 1.j), $675 (SOR 1.k), $150 (SOR 1.l), $873 (SOR 1.m), $2,568 (SOR 1.n), $2,568 \n(SOR 1.t, duplicate of SOR 1.n), $842 (SOR 1.u), $434 (SOR 1.v), $9,238 (SOR 1.w), \n$1,219 (SOR 1.x), and $2,277 (SOR 1.y); a credit card debt in collection for $901 (SOR \n1.o); a cable company debt in collection for $101 (SOR 1.p); a credit card in collection \nfor $1,605 (SOR 1.q); a credit card in collection for $640 (SOR 1.r), and a department \nstore credit account in collection for $1,145 (SOR 1.s; Tr. 34-37; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit \nreport, date November 4, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated June 16, 2007).  \nApplicant acknowledged all of the debt (Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated \nMay 21, 2008; Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to Interrogatories, dated August 13, 2008; Gov. Ex. \n4, Credit report, dated November 4, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report dated June 16, \n2007).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant had a position for over seven years with a defense contractor that \nprovided medical benefits.  A condition of employment with the contractor was the ability \nto work overtime and on weekends when required.  Applicant was able to work overtime \nwhen required through much of his employment with the company.  The company \nusually provided a few days notice of required overtime work.  Applicant lived with his \ngirlfriend and she worked nights and weekends.  In early 2002, Applicant and his \ngirlfriend had a baby.  In November 2002, Applicant was told late on a Friday afternoon \nthat he was required to work overtime on that Saturday and Sunday from about 3 pm \nuntil 2 am.  His girlfriend was already scheduled to work and could not take care of the \nchild.  His son had been sick for about a week and even had been taken to the hospital.  \nApplicant did not have anyone available to provide child care for the infant.  Since he \nwas unable to work the overtime, Applicant was terminated (Tr. 19-21).   \n \nAfter being terminated, Applicant was unable to find steady employment that also \nprovided benefits.  From November 2002 until February 2004, Applicant was \nunemployed or worked as a security guard which did not have health benefits.  In \nFebruary 2004, Applicant had congestive heart failure and received extensive medical \ntreatment and hospitalization.  The medical debts listed as delinquent debts in the SOR \nare a result of this medical issue and treatment (Tr. 21-23; See Response to SOR, \nDoctor's Letter, dated February 20, 2004). \n \nAfter being released from the hospital, Applicant was unable to work for about \ntwo years and only drew unemployment insurance.  In January 2006, he found work as \na security officer.  He worked as a security officer without benefits until February 2007. \nwhen he stared working for his present employer who provides health benefits (Tr. 22-\n23; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated June 15, 2007).  He is rated by his employer as an \nexcellent worker who exceeds or meets expectations (App. Ex. F, Performance review, \ndated February 26, 2007).  His present supervisor stated that Applicant is one of his \nmost trusted and dependable employees.  His work ethic is a model for others and he is \nwilling to assist others at work.  He is a great and valuable employee because of his \nhigh integrity (App. Ex. I, Letter, undated). \n \nApplicant attempted to get a debt consolidation loan from his bank to pay his \ndelinquent debts but was rejected (Tr. 14-15, App. Ex. A, Loan request, dated March \n14, 2009).  He also consulted an attorney to consider filing a bankruptcy petition.  After \nreviewing his financial situation with the attorney, Applicant decided against bankruptcy.  \nHe discussed his finances with his father who may assist him in paying some of his \ndebts (Tr. 15-17, App. Ex. B, Letter, dated December 22, 2008; App. Ex. B, Statement \nof Finances, undated). \n \nApplicant has approximately $9,000 in student loans that are not delinquent \nbecause they are in forbearance for financial hardship.  He submitted a request to the \ncreditor for a new payment plan (Tr. 24-26; App. Ex. H, Application for Repayment, \ndated January 26, 2009).  Of the 25 delinquent debts, 20 were medical debts from his \ncongestive heart failure treatment in 2004.  He made two small payments on the \nmedical debts from the hospital (App. Ex. J, Receipt, dated April 7, 2009; App. Ex. K \n\n \n4 \n \n \nReceipt, dated April 7, 2009).  The other five debts are for a telephone bill (SOR 1.o); a \ncable bill (SOR 1.p); a credit card used to purchase books when he was in school (SOR \n1.q); a credit card (SOR 1.r); and a store credit card (SOR 1.s).  Applicant has not been \nable to make payments on these accounts.  He does not have sufficient disposable \nincome to permit more debt payment.  He has the information concerning the debts and \nwill be attempting to make payments soon (Tr. 35-36).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching  \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed on the credit \nreports are a security concern.  He was unable to pay his debts because of his medical \ncondition and employment in low paying jobs with no benefits.  This raises Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  He \nhas a history of not meeting financial obligations because of an inability to satisfy debt. \n \n \nApplicant raised mitigating circumstances for his debts by his testimony.  I \nconsidered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and it  has some application.  Only \ntwo of the debts were paid recently and the remaining debts are unpaid.  Since debts \nare not being paid, there are current debts.  Most of the debts are medical debts but \nthere are also credit card, store credit, cable, and telephone debts, so Applicant has \nnumerous delinquent debts.  The majority of his debt was incurred as a result of losing \nhis job, being unemployed or employed in a lower paying job without health insurance, \nand having a severe medical problem.  His medical problem and lack of good \nemployment affected his ability to pay his debts.  Applicant is now solidly employed in \nthe civilian workforce.  His financial problems should not recur.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.  Applicant did not have financial \nproblems until he was terminated by his former employer when he could not work \novertime because of child care issues. He lost his health insurance and only worked low \npaying jobs without benefits.  He had congestive heart failure which required extensive \nand expensive medical care.  Without health insurance, he could not pay his medical \ndebts.  He was unemployed for almost two years before finding low paying jobs without \nbenefits.  His medical problems and lack of good employment prevented him from \npaying his other delinquent debts.  He is now employed with good pay and benefits.  He \nhas contacted creditors and is working with them to establish payment plans.  He made \nsmall payments on some of his debts.  He acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol) does not apply.  Applicant has not received any formal financial counseling.  He \ndid consult an attorney concerning bankruptcy.  He also talked to his father and sought \nassistance from him to pay some of his debts.  This is not considered financial \ncounseling.  However, he has taken the best actions he could under the circumstances \nto resolve his financial problems and his present finances are under control.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) partially applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.  Applicant has only limited ability to pay the debts, but he has shown a strong \ndesire to pay his debts, and is making some effort to pay them.  Applicant paid two of \nthe debts recently.  He has not incurred additional delinquent debts.  Applicant acted \nresponsibly towards his debts, and established that he is taking good-faith efforts to try \nto resolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns for his financial situation \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's debts were \ncaused when he was terminated from steady employment with benefits when he was \nunable to work overtime.  He worked low paying jobs and he did not have health \ninsurance.  He had congestive heart failure incurring large medical bills.  He was unable \nto pay his debts because of the congestive heart failure and periods of unemployment \nand underemployment.  He recently paid two of the debts.  Applicant lives within his \nmeans and meets his present personal financial obligations.  His actions do not indicate \npoor self control, lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  \nHe is not financially overextended, and his finances do not create a security concern.  \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.y:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn October 28, 2005, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 15, 2008. He requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn February 12, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \n \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on February 20, 2009.  \nApplicant filed a response to the FORM on March 10, 2009, within the 30 day time \nallowed that would have expired on March 20, 2009.  The Department Counsel had no \nobjection to the additional documents Applicant submitted being added to the FORM \npackage. I received the case assignment on April 8, 2009. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Japan. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Item 14. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \n \nDepartment Counsel also requests I take administrative notice of the Equifax \nTraining Brochure, which explains how to read Equifax credit reports (Item 12).    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 15, 2008, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old, and married to his second wife since July 2002.  His \nwife is a Japanese national.  Applicant lives with his wife and his two children in Japan, \nwhere he works for a defense contractor.  He did not present information regarding \nwhen he moved to Japan or why he did so. Applicant\u2019s first wife is a German national, \nfrom whom he is divorced. He married his first wife in 1987 and divorced in 1989.  \nApplicant\u2019s children were born in 1993 and 1996 in the United States.  Applicant \nfathered two children by a girlfriend whom he never married.   He was ordered to pay \n$606 monthly for child support from 1995 onward.  According to Applicant\u2019s subject \ninterview in September 2007, his child support obligation stopped in September 2007, \nand he no longer owes any child support money. Applicant has custody of his two \nchildren now, and they live in Japan with him.  Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents live in Japan \nand are citizens of that country. (Items 3 and 5) \n \n \nApplicant has 10 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  The total amount of money \nowed is $52,882.  He resolved all but $1,049 of the minor debts through payment in full \nor installment payment agreements, albeit recently. Applicant asserted he could not pay \nthese debts previously because of his lower salaries and child support obligations. His \npay stubs from 2001 through 2003, samples of which he submitted, showed Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n \nearned about $30,000 annually (Item 3).  Applicant did not present any documentary \nevidence of his current salary. The current status of each debt is as follows: \n \n \n \n1. A medical debt for $45 (Subparagraph 1.a).  This debt dates from \nSeptember 2005. Applicant claims this debt should have been paid by the person who \nassaulted him in 2000. The assault occurred when Applicant returned the two children \nto their mother after a visit, and he was attacked by the former girlfriend\u2019s new \nboyfriend.  The police were summoned and the attacking boyfriend was arrested.  \nAccording to Applicant, the perpetrator was found guilty of assault and battery, and he \nwas ordered to pay Applicant\u2019s medical bills. He did not explain anything about the \nassault and its effect on his earning capacity. Applicant paid it on February 24, 2009, in \nthe amount of $88.72.  He submitted a letter from the creditor verifying the payment.  \n(Answer, FORM Response, Items 3, 6-11) \n \n \n \n2. A medical debt for $489 (Subparagraph 1.b).  This debt became \ndelinquent in November 2005. Applicant claims this debt should be paid by the person \nwho assaulted him in 2000.  It remains unpaid, although Applicant recently paid another \nmedical bill resulting from the same assault. (FORM Response, Items 3, 6-11) \n \n \n \n3. A medical bill for $98 resulting from the same assault in 2000 \n(Subparagraph 1.c). This debt became delinquent in November 2004. Applicant now \nasserts he disputes this debt because it is listed as an \u201cUnknown Creditor Named\u201d on \ncredit reports included in the FORM as Items 6 and 8.  The debt has existed since \nNovember 2004.  Item 7 does not list a name for the collection agency. The SOR does \nnot list the debt as owed to an unknown creditor.  Applicant\u2019s answer to the DOHA \nInterrogatories of September 25, 2008, lists this debt as arising from the 2000 assault.  \nIt remains unpaid. (FORM Response, Items 3, 6-11) \n \n \n \n4. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $462 to the state taxing authority \non a speeding ticket issued in the state where he lived previously in the United States \n(Subparagraph 1.d), $2,535 to the same state taxing authority for state income tax owed \nfrom an undisclosed tax year, possibly 1994 (Subparagraph 1.i), and $4,743 also to the \nsame state taxing authority in state income tax for another tax year which was \nundisclosed in the file documents, possibly 1996, according to the personal subject \ninterview included in Item 10 (Subparagraph 1.j).  Applicant has not submitted proof the \ndecade-old speeding ticket was paid.  Tax liens were filed against Applicant by the state \nauthority in November 2006 for some previous years\u2019 tax liabilities.  Those taxes have \nnow been paid, and the liens released.  Applicant sent copies of the lien releases, \nrecorded in January 2009.  Applicant claims he failed to file his state income tax forms \nwith the form used to show his income was earned outside the continental United \nStates, mistakenly thinking the filing of only the federal tax form would be sufficient to \nabsolve him of any state tax liability under the law.  Applicant did not submit any \nevidence that he worked outside the United States in 1995 or 1996, nor when he started \nworking outside the United States, to be able to avail himself of this provision of the U.S. \nTax Code. (FORM Response, Items 3-11) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n5. Applicant has a $50 debt to a video company (Subparagraph 1.e) \ndating from May 2004.  Applicant paid this debt on March 3, 2009.  He sent a copy of \nthe letter from the creditor as evidence the debt was paid. (FORM Response, Items 3-\n11) \n \n \n \n6. Applicant owes $169 to a collector for a telephone bill (Subparagraph \n1.f) dating from 2002.  Applicant paid this debt on February 25, 2009, and included a \nletter from the collector evidencing this payment in full. (FORM Response, Items 3-11) \n \n \n \n7. Applicant owes the U.S. Department of Education about $44,000 total \nfor two student loans (Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h) according to the February 2009 \ncredit report.  These loans were opened in 1991, and were delinquent by September \n2005.  Applicant obtained an Associate\u2019s of Arts degree in 1993. He did not repay the \nloans because he never made more than $10 per hour, and could not repay them. \nApplicant reports in the FORM Response that on January 28, 2009, he contracted with \na debt collection service to repay his student loans.  Applicant did not include a copy of \nthe agreement with the company.  He did include a copy of his bank statement showing \none $365 payment to the Department of Education on January 28, 2009.  His FORM \nResponse is dated March 7, 2009, and did not provide evidence of any payments after \nJanuary 28, 2009. (FORM Response, Items 3-11) \n \n \nApplicant borrowed $30,899 in July 2006 from a credit union to purchase a car.  \nApplicant made this purchase while owing the state income taxes and his student loans.  \nApplicant did not provide information on the make or model of car he purchased. The \nbalance owed in February 2009 is $19,757. On the March 2007 credit report the \nbalance is listed as $28,466. Applicant makes regular payments on this loan.  He also \nowes $12,075 as of February 2009, to the same credit union on a credit card.  An \nunsecured loan balance owed to the same credit union in February 2009 by Applicant is \n$7,421.  His child support obligation from May 2002 is listed as $3,656 on the February \n2009 credit report, and $6,992 on the March 2007 credit report.  Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe SOR includes a credit union account statement from December 2008. That \nstatement shows no money in Applicant\u2019s money market savings account, and money in \nhis checking account. The statement lists Applicant\u2019s car loan, credit card debt, and his \nsignature loan balances, for a total owed to that credit union of $40,358.70.  The credit \nreport of July 2008 shows Applicant\u2019s \u201cgrand total\u201d of debt as $90,808.  The February \n2009 credit report shows the total amount owed as $91,779. (Items 3-11) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a \u201cgreen\u201d immigration card.  She is currently a citizen and \nresident of Japan.  Her parents are currently citizens of and residents of Japan. \n(Answer, Item 5)  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Japan.  It is a \nconstitutional monarchy with an elected national legislature, a prime minister as the \nhead of government, and a hereditary emperor as the chief of state.  Japan is located in \nthe northern Pacific Ocean area on a series of islands.  For several centuries, Japan \nclosed itself off to the world.  In the middle and last part of the 19th Century, Japan \n\n \n5 \n \n \nopened its borders to commerce with the world, particularly the United States and \nWestern Europe.  It was never colonized by any nation.  In 1905, it defeated the \nRussian Empire in a naval war in the Pacific after it built a modern navy.  In World War I \nit fought on the side of the United States and the Allied Powers to defeat Germany and \nits allies.  In World War II it attacked the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in a \nsneak attack, sinking several battleships and other Navy vessels, destroying aircraft, \nand killing about 3,000 Americans.  That attack launched World War II in the Pacific.  In \nAugust 1945 the United States and its allies defeated Japan, which surrendered \nunconditionally.  Since then Japan has renounced war as an instrument of national \npolicy, and formed a self-defense force for its own protection.  Japan has developed a \nhealthy democratic government.  It is a large trading partner with the United States and \nthe world.  Now, Japan is considered an ally of the United States. \n \nJapan has economic and foreign policy issues which are the subject of its \ngovernment\u2019s attention.  Its economy has stagnated growth for the past decade.  Japan \nand China have residual issues from World War II when they were opponents. The two \nKoreas have various issues resulting from Japan\u2019s occupation of the Korean Peninsula \nfrom 1910 to 1945, and more recent issues with North Korea regarding the kidnapping \nfrom Japan of Japanese women.  Japan also has internal discussions regarding \npossible amendments to its U.S. written 1946 Constitution.  These discussions pertain \nto Constitutional provisions controlling its Self-Defense Forces and engagement in \ncollective security arrangements.  The amendments would allow Japan to expand its \nmilitary forces and allow participation in collective security organizations. \n \nThe U.S. Government lists Japan as one of the top 12 countries which engage in \nindustrial espionage.  It is also one of the top five nations requesting access to DoD and \nindustrial facilities in the United States.  Japanese automobile manufacturers also have \na large presence in the United States, having decreased the market share of U.S. \nmanufacturers and forcing them to shrink their work forces as the U.S. manufacturers \nrestructure themselves for the 21st Century marketplace. (Item 14) \n \nThe credit report training brochure explains the various contractions and \nabbreviations on the Equifax credit report forms.  The February 11, 2009, credit report \nshows Applicant owes $91,779 as the grand total for his two education loans, a car \nloan, two credit cards, child support arrearages from the time his former wife had \ncustody of their two children, and a personal loan.  Applicant makes payments on all \nloans. The SOR referred to $12,000 of other debt which Applicant has resolved.  The \nJuly 24, 2008, credit report compared to the later report shows a decrease in balances \non the various loans owed by Applicant, except the student loans which he is now \nresolving. Applicant did not disclose his income, except to declare his current \nemployment pays him more than past jobs did. (Items 3, 9, 11 and 12) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt between 1996 \nand 2005 and was unable or unwilling to pay those obligations until recently.  He paid \nonly the small obligations after the SOR was issued. He failed to pay his delinquent \ndebts while incurring another $40,358.70 in debt after he moved to Japan. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose in 1996 with the income tax liabilities for which liens were filed by \nthe state government where he lived. He continued to incur debt, which he did not \nrepay, including the $44,000 in student loans that became due in 2005.  He took no \naction to resolve these debts until 2009. The evidence does not raise this potentially \nmitigating condition because the situation is current, and Applicant, who has the burden \nof proof, has shown he added more debt to his balance sheet.  His current debt load is \nhigh, and without copies of his income statements and a current budget it is difficult to \nconclude his financial situation will not recur. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@  Applicant did not \npresent facts to show this mitigating condition has any applicability.  His divorce was in \n1989.  No unemployment periods and income information were presented. He did not \nmeet his burden of proof regarding this mitigating condition. I find this potentially \nmitigating condition is not a factor for consideration in this case.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not present any evidence of \ncounseling, except to state his education loans were to be handled by a debt \nmanagement company that he engaged in early 2009.  He did not submit the contract \nwith that company, nor did he provide any information about any counseling as a \ncomponent of that company\u2019s work for him.  This mitigating condition is not applicable. \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nresolved seven of the delinquent debts, either by payment or installment payment \nagreements. He failed to resolve three of the minor debts, totaling $1,049 \n(Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d).  These debts are minor in comparison to his total \ndebt load, and can be resolved quickly by payment.  However, he did not resolve his \nlarge student loan debt while at the same time borrowing over $40,000 for a car, credit \ncard purchases, and on a personal loan.  While he is making regular payments on these \ndebts, he ignored his preceding delinquent debts. I conclude this potentially mitigating \ncondition does not apply to Applicant\u2019s irresponsible actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e) contemplates for applicability that \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  Applicant did not submit any evidence that he \nhas a legitimate basis for disputing any of the unresolved or unpaid debts.  While he \nclaims one debt is listed on the latest credit report as being owed to an unnamed \ncreditor, he acknowledged in his interrogatories that it was a medical debt resulting from \ntreatment he received after an assault in 2000.  Applicant needs to be more diligent in \nidentifying this creditor through the credit reporting agencies, and paying this debt.  This \nmitigating condition is not applicable. \n \nThe final mitigating condition, AG \u00b6 20 (f), requiring \u201cthe affluence resulted from a \nlegal source of income,\u201d is not applicable because Applicant has not shown any \naffluence.  \n \nThe burden of proof and persuasion is on Applicant to show any or all of the \nmitigating conditions should apply.  Applicant failed to submit persuasive explanations \nof financial activities from 1996 to the present.  He did not explain why or when he \nmoved to Japan, or what his current salary is or has been since he moved there. He did \nnot submit any evidence explaining why he did not repay his delinquent debts before \n2009 while buying a new car for over $30,000 in 2006, and at the same time running up \na credit card bill of more than $12,000, which will take some years to repay. Both debts \nare owed to the same credit union. Clearly, Applicant has not made full disclosure about \nhis finances, the events of the past decade which caused his current situation, and has \nfailed in his burden because these gaps in his presentation are too massive to persuade \n\n \n9 \n \n \nme otherwise.  He ignored his delinquent debts until the SOR was issued. That is not \nthe action of a trustworthy and reliable person exercising good financial judgment.   \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates \nthat the individual's access to protected information may involve \nunacceptable risk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign \nnational; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, \nassociate, or employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign \ncountry are acting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible \nfuture exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and, \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \n \nThree of these disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6 7 (a), (d), and (e), have applicability \non these facts.  Applicant lives with his wife, a Japanese national with a \u201cgreen\u201d card.  \nThis relationship could create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion because Applicant may want to bring his wife to the \nUnited States at some time in the future.  Her parents live in Japan, and the same \nconcerns for his wife apply to her parents.  Furthermore, Applicant has a greater interest \nin keeping his job in Japan now and in the future.  Threatened with expulsion on some \nground by a governmental authority, Applicant might be coerced to violate security \nregulations.  This disqualifying condition applies. \n \nApplicant shares living quarters with his wife, and the same security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 7 (a) would apply under this disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7 (d).  This \ndisqualifying condition applies.  \n \nApplicant has a well-paying job in Japan.  He wants to keep it, and remain \nresiding with his wife in Japan.  Under AG \u00b6 7 (e), he has a \u201csubstantial financial in a \nforeign country.\u201d  Desiring to retain this job and its income, Applicant could be coerced \nor manipulated into violating security regulations.  This disqualifying condition applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \n\n \n11 \n \n \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government \nbusiness or are approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \nThe two potentially mitigating conditions are AG \u00b6 8 (a) and (b).  The nature of \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife and her parents, and living in Japan, make it \nunlikely that he will have to choose between the interests of a foreign group, his wife, \nthe Japanese Government, and the interests of the U.S. Government.  The marital \nunion does not create a relationship at conflict with the U.S. Government\u2019s interests by \nits nature.  Japan is a country friendly to the United States.  Applicant is in Japan, and \nits industrial information gathering activities are more likely to occur within the United \nStates as opposed to accosting Applicant at his job.  Applicant did not present any \nevidence that he owned real property anywhere in the world, but I consider that a minor \nconcern in this case.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 8 (b), Applicant has no conflict of interest because of his loyalties to \nthe United States. He has no loyalty to any foreign group or entity, except his wife.  \nApplicant\u2019s children were born in the United States, and he has a duty to protect them.  \nFinally, all of Applicant\u2019s ties are to the United States, including his banking accounts \nare with a United States financial institution. Applicant grew up in the United States and \nobtained his Associate\u2019s degree there. \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n12 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult and was \nso when his debts accumulated.  He ignored his delinquent debt from 1996 to 2005.  \nWhile Applicant pays his car and personal loans, and his credit card bills regularly, he \naccumulated over $40,000 in new debt while leaving his older debt unpaid or resolved. \nThere is likelihood for coercion or manipulation because of Applicant\u2019s substantial \ndebts.  He has not acted responsibly, and his continued borrowing of money has not \nshown he has been rehabilitated from his past spending habits.  Furthermore, the lack \nof information Applicant provided to provide a persuasive presentation that he is worthy \nof a security clearance is of concern.  He has not told the entire truth about his finances \nand activities over the past 13 years. He showed a recurring pattern of questionable \njudgment and financial irresponsibility (AG \u00b6 2 (d)).  Any doubt concerning a security \nclearance applicant \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security\u201d (AG \u00b6 2 (b)).  \nThere is that doubt here, in large part because there is no evidence that Applicant has a \ntrack record of managing his debts or a demonstrated ability to repay his loans. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \nHe did mitigate the foreign influence security concerns.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.
