Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBrett J. O\u2019Brien, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April\n10, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On July 24, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government failed to prove the\nsole SOR allegation and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in his early 60s, is a naturalized citizen.  He has advanced educational\ndegrees.  From 2000 to 2016, he worked for Federal contractors.   Specifically, the Judge found:\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment with\na federal contractor for gross negligence in September 2016, after his employer\u2019s\ninternal investigation determined that he intentionally and knowingly manipulated\nprogram performance test data.  Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his\nemployment for gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally\nor knowingly manipulated the data.\n* * *\nApplicant also admitted to his program manager that he intentionally\nsubstituted data from another test into his test data.  To substitute the data, Applicant\nhad to manually overwrite the test data results.  A folder with data was erased from\ncontractor\u2019s . . . network.  The overwriting and erasing of the data was established\nthrough the computer logs.  When questioned by a second coworker about the data\nsubstitution, Applicant stated that he wanted to \u201ccome clean\u201d and asked the coworker\nto pray for him.\n* * *\nThe Department of Air Force Office of Special Investigations submitted a\nreport of investigation (ROI) in September 2017.  The report titled Applicant for\nfraud offenses (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game).\nDuring his September 2017 background interview with a government\ninvestigator, Applicant stated that he had not disclosed his termination to any\nmember of his family or friends.  He lied to his spouse about his termination and told\n2\n\nher that he had retired early.  When asked why, he stated that his native country\u2019s\nculture does not allow the head of a household to be disgraced in the eyes of his\nfamily.  He reiterated that if this become an issue he would retire.  [Decision at 2-3.]\nApplicant did not disclose his termination to his current employer because the employer\nidentified him as a valuable asset and spent a large sum on his relocation.  He also indicated that,\nfollowing his 2017 background interview, \u201che had a chat with his wife about his termination and she\nis now aware of it.\u201d  Decision at 4.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cApplicant intentionally and knowingly manipulated program performance test data, resulting\nin his termination from his employment with a federal contractor for gross negligence in September\n2016.\u201d  Decision at 5.  Applicant admits the termination was for gross negligence, but denies\nintentional manipulation of the data.  His emails and memoranda establish he may have inadvertently\ndeleted his working directory before the data was captured and \u201cthen knowingly entered the wrong\nnumbers to produce anomalies later discovered . . . .\u201d  Id.  He expressed immense shame for his\nactions.  \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was serious.  He did not disclose his misconduct until the mistakes were\ndiscovered.  His conduct shows he cannot be trusted to disclose problems to his employer, and it\ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.   He has not fully admitted his\nmisconduct and continues to perpetuate false statements.  He has not taken steps to reduce his\nvulnerability to exploitation.  He has knowingly failed to disclose his prior misconduct to his current\nemployer and his \u201cchat with his wife\u201d is insufficient to establish that she or his family know about\nhis misconduct.  None of the mitigating conditions are established. \nDiscussion\nStandard of Proof\nApplicant contends the Judge \u201crelied on numerous factual and legal errors in coming to the\nconclusion that [Applicant] should be denied a security clearance.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 3.  He argues,\nfor example, that the Judge applied the wrong standard of proof standard by asserting:\nDepartment Counsel has to prove by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which is a burden of\nproof higher than \u201cprobable cause\u201d but less than a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d\nstandard.  Department Counsel failed to meet this burden by alleging conclusions that\nwould not have sufficed for a judge or magistrate to issue a search warrant and\n[these] unsupportable conclusions were adopted by the Administrative Judge. \n[Appeal Brief at 9.]\nWe do not agree with Applicant\u2019s reliance on the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard.  On appeal, we\nreview a Judge\u2019s challenged findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial\n3\n\nevidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  We review a Judge\u2019s challenged\nconclusions to determine whether they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.  A Judge\u2019s conclusions are often subjective in nature and are sustainable if they constitute\nreasonable inferences drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nJun. 25, 2019).  See also, ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) (setting forth the\nstandard applied to determine whether a Judge\u2019s conclusions are erroneous).\nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard to evaluate a Judge\u2019s findings or\nconclusions is misplaced.  Applicant cites no authority that supports his argument.  As we have\npreviously stated, substantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999).  See also Universal\nCamera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951).  We dismiss\nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard because it has no application in reviewing the\nsufficiency of a Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions in security clearance adjudications. \n \nReport of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)\nApplicant claims that there are evidentiary issues with the AFOSI report of investigation that\nwas admitted into evidence.  In this regard, it first merits noting that Applicant was provided a copy\nof Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) and was given an opportunity to submit\nobjections to the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits, which were listed as \u201cItems\u201d in the FORM.  In\nresponding to the FORM, Applicant submitted no objections to those proposed exhibits, including\nthe AFOSI investigation.  The Judge properly admitted the FORM exhibits into evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-20031 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2004) (an appealing party must take timely,\nreasonable steps to raise objections or other procedural matters below to preserve them for appeal). \nGiven these circumstances, we conclude the issues that Applicant is raising about the AFOSI\ninvestigation do not go to its admissibility, an issue that he forfeited by failing to raise an objection\nto it below, but rather go to the weight the investigative report should be given.  \nIn challenging the sufficiency of the AFOSI investigation, Applicant contends it \u201cwas very\nrudimentary and merely adopted [the employer\u2019s] investigation without re-analyzing or re-\ninterviewing potential witnesses.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 6.  He further argues:\nA sophisticated and complicated situation cannot be resolved simply by interviewing\na few people and adopting another entity\u2019s investigation as its own.  Inspecting and\ndissecting the data is of the utmost importance.  It is also puzzling how a law\nenforcement officer with no engineering or scientific background can absorb and\nunderstand a situation like this and then judge an actual engineer\u2019s thought process,\ndiscretion, and actions against industry norms (again, without establishing the\nindustry norms in the investigation).  [Appeal Brief at 8.]  \n4\n\nIn this regard, we have previously stated that an employers\u2019s decisions and characterizations of\nevents are entitled to some deference.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26,\n2012).  Such deference extends to an employer\u2019s internal investigation and is particularly fitting\nwhen the conduct in question, as in this case, involves scientific and technical matters.  See also,\nDISCR Case No. 93-1234 at 4 (App. Bd. May 19, 1995)(a Judge did not err in admitting a corporate\ninquiry prepared for Defense Investigative Service (DIS)).  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s findings\nand conclusions that are consistent with the employer\u2019s stated reasons for terminating Applicant\u2019s\nemployment.  While Applicant initially challenged his employment termination, he did not succeed\nin overturning that decision.  He claimed that he gave up on challenging the termination because the\nlegal fees were too expensive and he moved to another state for a new job. \nApplicant also argues that the AFOSI investigative report contains multiple layers of hearsay. \nFor example, he points out that it contains or incorporates summaries of interviews, which is not\nuncommon in such investigative reports.  While the existence of multiple layers of hearsay in\nexhibits is a matter the Judge should appropriately consider in evaluating such evidence,\ninvestigative reports of this nature are routinely admitted and considered in security clearance\nadjudications.  See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 90-2069 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 1992)(DIS\nreport); ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2009)(Army Criminal Investigation\nDivision report); ISCR Case No. 11-05079 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012)(Naval Criminal\nInvestigative Service report); and ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017)(police\nreport).  Furthermore, the weight given to such evidence is a matter within the Judge\u2019s special\nprovince.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00857 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019)(citing Inwood\nLaboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 (1982) (\u201cDetermining the weight and\ncredibility of the evidence is the special province of the trier of fact.\u201d).  In this case, Applicant has\nfailed to establish that the Judge erred in his consideration of the AFOSI investigative report.  \nCharacterization of Applicant\u2019s Conduct\nApplicant asserts the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant \u201cintentionally manipulated\ndata and engaged in gross negligence\u201d while employed by a defense contractor.  Appeal Brief at 1.\n[Emphasis in Appeal Brief.]  This assertion lacks merit.  We first note the defense contractor\nsubmitted an adverse information report to the Defense Security Service in 2016 that stated,\n\u201c[Applicant\u2019s] employment with [the defense contractor] was terminated [on a dated in 2016] for\ngross negligence after an internal investigation determined that [Applicant] intentionally and\nknowingly manipulated . . . program performance test data.\u201d  FORM Item 5.  This reason for\nApplicant\u2019s termination was also repeated in a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) entry\n(Id.) and the AFOSI investigative report (FORM Item 6).  Applicant argues the reason presented for\nhis  termination, i.e., \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201cintentionally and knowingly\u201d engaging in manipulation\nof data, creates an inconsistency because those are different levels of culpability having distinct\n\u201cmens rea\u201d that were applied to the conduct at issue.  As quoted above, the Judge initially concluded\nthat Applicant intentionally and knowingly manipulated program performance test data but also\nnoted Applicant\u2019s misconduct resulted in the termination of his employment with a Federal\ncontractor for gross negligence.  This conclusion was consistent with the employer\u2019s stated reason\nfor Applicant\u2019s termination.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant apparently inadvertently\n5\n\ndeleted his working directory before data was captured and then knowingly entered the wrong\nnumbers to produce the anomalies that were later discovered.  This conclusion involves both\nnegligent and intentional conduct.  The Judge thereafter referred to Applicant\u2019s conduct as\n\u201cmisconduct and gross negligence.\u201d  Decision at 6.  We find no logical or legal inconsistency in the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions about Applicant\u2019s conduct.  The important point is that Applicant\u2019s conduct \u2013\nwhether characterized as \u201cgross negligence,\u201d \u201cintentional and knowing,\u201d or both \u2013 was sufficient to\nraise security concerns, such as questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and lack of\ncandor, under Guideline E.  Applicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error\nin concluding his conduct raised security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s Statements\n    \nApplicant contends that his admission to his former employer that his conduct constituted\ngross negligence was in error.  We note he made that same admission in responding to the SOR. \nFORM Item 3.  Applicant argues that English is not his native language, and he did not understand\nexactly what he was saying in using the term \u201cgross negligence.\u201d  We do not find this argument\npersuasive.  Applicant did not raise this issue below for the Judge to consider.  We note Applicant\nentered the United States 36 years ago, has earned a master\u2019s degree and doctorate degree from a\nprestigious U.S. university, and has worked for Federal contractors for about two decades.  FORM\nItem 4 and Decision at 2.  He has not established the Judge erred by failing to disregard or discount\nhis \u201cgross negligence\u201d admission.  This admission constitutes substantial evidence that the Judge\ncould rely in making findings of fact and in drawing conclusions.  Additionally, Applicant argues\nthat his conduct merely constituted simple negligence in record keeping that does not warrant the\ndenial of his security clearance.  We do not share Applicant\u2019s view that \u201csimple negligence  . . . is\nvery low on the spectrum of security concerns.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 13.  When it comes to protecting\nnational security information, simple negligence can be a matter of grave concern under some\ncircumstances. \nApplicant also argues the Judge erred in concluding that insufficient evidence existed to\nestablish that he disclosed his employment termination to his wife.  A Judge need not accept an\napplicant's statement or testimony at face value even if it is unrebutted.  Indeed, it would be arbitrary\nand capricious for a Judge to uncritically accept an individual\u2019s statement or testimony without\nconsidering whether it is plausible and consistent with other record evidence.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case\nNo. 05-03554 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2007).  \n     \nMitigation and Whole-Person Analysis\nApplicant asserts that the Judge erred in his analysis of the mitigating evidence and in his\nwhole-person assessment.  He argues, for example, that the Judge gave unfair weight to aggravating\nfactors and dismissed mitigating evidence; that the conduct in question was an isolated incident in\nan otherwise lengthy career; and that he disclosed his termination on his security clearance\napplication and was not required to disclose it to his new employer.  In essence, these arguments are\na challenge to the way in which the Judge weighed the evidence and are neither enough to rebut the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that\n6\n\nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01284 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2015).  \nConclusion\nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On December 14, 2018, after considering the\nrecord, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for CAC eligibility.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Instruction, Encl.\n4 \u00b6 6.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has worked for her current employer, a Defense contractor, since 2017.  Before\ntaking this job, she worked in the private sector from 1999 to 2017, when she was fired for\nmisconduct.  Applicant was fired because she disclosed to a family member information that Federal\nlaw requires be kept confidential.  Later, when completing a Form 306,1 she failed to disclose her\njob termination.  Applicant admitted this failure but attributed it to having paid insufficient attention\nto the question at hand because she was focused on other portions of the form.  The Judge found this\nexplanation to be implausible.\n \nThe Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s misconduct at work was recent and significant enough to\ncost her a job.  He concluded that Applicant had not mitigated the concerns arising from her job\ntermination.  He also stated that it was implausible that Applicant would not have remembered a\nsignificant life event such as having been fired for misconduct.  He concluded that it was more\nreasonable to believe that Applicant left her job termination off the Form 306 because she was afraid\nthat disclosure could cost her a job.  The Judge concluded that the false statement was recent and\nintentional.  He stated that he was not able to determine that future misconduct or false statements\nare unlikely to recur.  He concluded that granting Applicant CAC eligibility posed an unacceptable\nrisk as defined in the Instruction.\nDiscussion\nInstruction, Enclosure 4 \u00b6 6 provides that appeals to DOHA of CAC cases are accorded the\nestablished administrative procedures set out in DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 1991, as amended).  Accordingly, our prior decisions\ninterpreting the Directive in industrial security cases are relevant in evaluating appeals of CAC\ndecisions.  See, e.g., CAC Case No. 15-02333 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2016).  \n1Declaration for Federal Employment.\n2\n\nIn a CAC adjudication, \u201cthe overriding factor . . . is unacceptable risk.\u201d2  Instruction,\nEnclosure 4 \u00b6 1(b).  The Supplemental Adjudicative Standards, which apply in this case, are\ndesigned to ensure that the issuance of a CAC does not pose such a risk.  See, e.g., CAC Case No.\n16-03527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2018).  \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes information from outside the record, including documents that\npost-date the Judge\u2019s decision.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.

See, e.g., CAC Case No. 16-03527 at 3. Applicant cites to various aspects\nof the record that she believes support her effort to obtain a favorable adjudication.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJessica R. K. Dorman, Esq.\nLance R. Claery, Esq\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 16, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 18, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in admitting his\ncredit reports and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged that he had filed for bankruptcy twice, under Chapter 7 in 2015 and\nunder Chapter 13 in 2017.  The bankruptcy documents included in the case file show that he had\nseveral debts, and these debts are confirmed by the contents of his credit reports.  The reasons for\nthe financial problems that underlay his bankruptcy filings include Applicant having provided\nfinancial support for his father, who suffered from dementia.  He also helped pay for his younger\nsister\u2019s private school.  In assuming these financial responsibilities, Applicant took out a home\nequity line of credit, and he used credit cards as well.  During the course of his financial difficulties,\nApplicant took a trip to Europe for a vacation.\nAs stated above, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015, and most of his debts\nwere discharged in the middle of that year.  Some debts, however, were not discharged\u2013his\nautomobile loan, his student loans, and his mortgage.  Applicant received financial counseling and\ndebtor education during the course of his bankruptcy action.  After his bankruptcy discharge,\nApplicant was unemployed for three to four months, and he fell behind on his expenses. \nAccordingly, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in mid-2017.  Applicant testified that\nhe is making payments under this plan.  Applicant believes that his family took advantage of him\nover the years by permitting him to pay family expenses without providing any assistance of their\nown.  His credit history shows that he had financial difficulties even before he undertook to provide\nfinancial assistance to his father.  A 2009 credit report shows numerous collection and charge-off\naccounts.\nApplicant\u2019s three witnesses, all of whom have held security clearances at some point, attest\nto his good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  These witnesses recommend Applicant for\na security clearance.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge found Applicant to be a \u201ccompassionate and kind-hearted man\u201d who had made\nbad financial decisions in taking on responsibility for his father\u2019s expenses.  Decision at 5.  She\nstated that, instead of paying his own bills, he paid those of family members, with the result that he\n2\n\nhas filed for bankruptcy protection twice in the past few years.  Although he realizes that his other\nfamily members took advantage of him, Applicant, by his own admission, cannot guarantee that it\nwill not happen again.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties raise unresolved\nquestions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in admitting four credit reports over his objection. \nHe argues that the Government failed to provide evidence attesting to the authenticity of these\ndocuments.  We examine a Judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine if they are consistent with the\nDirective and if they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047\nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).  Credit reports are generally admissible as part of the Government\u2019s\ncase in chief.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015).   Also, ISCR Case\nNo. 07-08925 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2018) has an in-depth discussion of the admissibility of\ncredit reports in DOHA proceedings.  A credit report qualifies as a record compiled or created in the\nregular course of business and, therefore, is admissible without an authenticating witness.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.20.  There is nothing on the face of the challenged documents to suggest that they are other\nthan what they purport to be, and, contrary to Applicant\u2019s arguments, their meaning can reasonably\nbe ascertained.1  The Judge\u2019s decision to admit Applicant\u2019s credit reports was consistent with the\nDirective and was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis of his case for mitigation.  In support of his\nargument, he has attached to his brief information from outside the record.  We cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant contends that the Judge erred by considering\nevidence of non-alleged conduct, such as his relatively old debts and his European trip.  We do not\nfind this argument to be persuasive.  In the first place, debts that were included in Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcy actions are within the scope of the SOR, even if they were not independently alleged. \nMoreover, conduct not alleged or otherwise fairly embraced by the SOR may be relevant for other\npurposes: making a credibility determination; evaluating the applicant\u2019s case for extenuation or\nmitigation; evaluating the extent to which the applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation; and in\nperforming a whole-person analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3  (App. Bd. Aug. 16,\n2017).  The Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s older debts and his trip in the context of his case for\nmitigation, specifically in evaluating his claim that his problems resulted from his financial\nassistance to his father.  Insofar as this claim was a principle part of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation,\nwe find no error in the Judge\u2019s having considered this evidence.2\n1We also note that Federal Rules of Evidence 901(b) provides: \u201c[b]y way of illustration only, and not by way\nof limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:\n... (4) Distinctive characteristics and the like.  Appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive\ncharacteristics, taken in conjunction with the circumstances.\u201d\n2Applicant states that he was placed on notice only of the two bankruptcy actions.  Appeal Brief at 9.  However,\nas stated above, the Judge properly considered evidence of Applicant\u2019s debts, even though they were not specifically\nalleged.  Applicant was provided copies of the Government\u2019s evidence prior to the hearing.  Tr. at 16.  We find no reason\nto conclude that Applicant was subjected to unfair surprise in the evidence adduced at the hearing or that he was\n3\n\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s argument is, in effect, a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  However, an ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the record is not\nsufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  Given\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s two bankruptcy filings over a course of two years, the financial problems\nunderlying those filings, and a paucity of evidence to show that Applicant has put these problems\nbehind him, the Judge did not err in concluding that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of\npersuasion regarding mitigation.\nApplicant has identified no harmful error in the Decision.  The Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on\nthis record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent\nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 9, 2019, after\nthe hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nhis financial circumstances raised security concerns and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant filed his Federal and state income tax returns late for tax years 2008 through 2016. \nThough he admitted that he had done so, he relied on a rule whereby Federal taxpayers will not be\nsubjected to a penalty if they file within three years, provided that they are owed a refund.

Later in 2012, he told an investigator that he was concerned about the\nimpact of his filing delinquencies on his security clearance, that he had hired a tax consultant, and\nthat he expected to have his returns filed by mid-year.  At the hearing, he admitted that he had not\nhired someone to help him with his taxes.\nIn responding to DOHA interrogatories in 2014, Applicant provided tax transcripts that\nshowed that he filed his 2008, 2009, and 2010 Federal and state returns in 2012, his 2011 state return\nin 2013, and his 2011Federal return in 2014. In his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had failed\nto file his tax returns in a timely fashion for 2010 through 2015.  His subsequent interrogatory\nanswers included documentation that showed he had filed late for 2016 as well.  He explained these\nlate filings as having been the result of not completely understanding the impact of delinquent taxes\non his clearance eligibility.  He vowed that he was working with a tax preparation company to assist\nhim in complying with his tax obligations and signed a statement of intent never again to file his\nreturns late.  Applicant is financially secure.  In 2018, he completed an on-line credit counseling\ncourse, budget analysis, and financial plan.  He has monthly income of about $10,000 and expenses\nof about $9,800.  Colleagues described Applicant as skilled, honest, truthful, and forthright.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax problems established two Guideline F\ndisqualifying conditions: 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d  and 19(f), \u201cfailure\nto file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns . . . as required.\u201d1  In evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation, the Judge stated that, even if Applicant honestly believed that he\n1Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(c, f).\n2\n\nhad three years in which to file his returns, he had previously acknowledged that late filing could\nhave an impact on his clearance.  The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s conduct raised questions about\nhis judgment and reliability.\n  \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that his tax issues do not raise security concerns.  He states that he does\nnot have a history of financial problems and that he has not failed to file his returns as required.  On\nthis latter point, he reiterates his belief that he had three years in which to file his returns without\npenalty, insofar as he was entitled to refunds.  Noting that Federal law elsewhere sets April 15 as\nthe date for filing taxes, he contends that the law is confusing and that he acted through honest\nmisunderstanding.  He notes that he had previously been granted a clearance despite having\ndisclosed late tax filings.\nWe have addressed the \u201cthree-year rule\u201d before.  In ISCR Case No. 12-11357 at 4 (App. Bd.\nJun. 17, 2016), we noted that the cited rule requires that a Federal taxpayer file within three years\nin order to receive a refund.  This rule does not provide that taxpayers owed a refund can\nlegitimately file after the April 15 deadline without first obtaining an extension.  \u201cThe fact that the\nIRS may waive a late filing penalty does not constitute proof that tax returns were not filed late . .\n. The three-year statute of limitation is not a grant of a filing extension, but only a limitation on\nclaiming a refund.\u201d  See also ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015).  Applicant\u2019s\nargument that the law is complex and therefore capable of being misunderstood is not a reason to\nexcuse a multi-year failure to have complied with Federal and state tax laws, especially in light of\nhis 2012 realization that his late filings could imperil his clearance.2  The Directive presumes that\nthere is a nexus, or rational connection, between admitted or proved conduct under any of the\nGuidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) .  Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal are not enough to rebut the presumption\nof nexus.  The Judge did not err in concluding that Applicant\u2019s late tax filings raised the\ndisqualifying conditions cited above.  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief constitutes, in effect, a challenge to the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  Among other things, Applicant cites to his having been granted a clearance in 2012\ndespite admissions of late filings.  Prior decisions to grant or retain a clearance do not undermine\nthe legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s subsequent adverse decision.  The government is not estopped\nfrom making an adverse clearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.   See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03047 at 4 (App. Bd. May 29, 2018).  This is especially true when, as here,\nApplicant continued to file his returns late after having been placed on notice that doing so could\nimperil his access to classified information.  Applicant\u2019s arguments are not enough to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).\n2In any event, the rule that Applicant has cited applies by definition only to his Federal returns for years in\nwhich he was entitled to a refund.  It would not apply to his admittedly late 2008 Federal return or to his late state returns\nfor the years in question.     \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDaniel Meyer, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn March 20, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 12, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndesignation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process, \nwhether the Judge was biased against her, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has fourteen delinquent debts, totaling about $39,700.  These debts are for such\nthings as credit cards, charge accounts, medical expenses, and automobile loans.  Applicant\nattributed her problems to expenses incurred due to the death of her father-in-law; a move due to her\nhusband\u2019s military service; her son\u2019s illness; her husband\u2019s health problems as well as her own; and\nher own unemployment while tending to her son.  In addition to these things, Applicant took out a\nloan to pay for tickets to a theme park.\nApplicant testified that she worked with a debt repair firm but provided no documentation\nthat this firm actually resolved any of her debts, none of which Applicant has paid.  About two weeks\nbefore the hearing, she contacted two debt relief organizations.  She made a payment to one of them\na day before the hearing.  She plans to address her debts with her anticipated income tax refund and\na disability award that her husband expects.  Applicant\u2019s co-workers and close friends find her to be\ntrustworthy and diligent.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s problems were affected by circumstances beyond her\ncontrol, as outlined above.  However, he further concluded that she had not demonstrated responsible\naction in regard to her debts, citing to questionable expenditures for loans and purchases that could\nhave been directed toward resolving her financial difficulties.  The Judge noted a paucity of evidence\nconcerning the debt relief firm that Applicant hired, and he commented as well on her \u201clast minute\nmaneuvers\u201d in contacting other credit repair services, evidence that he found merited little weight. \n2\n\nDecision at 7.  He stated that, given the totality of the evidence, it is foreseeable that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems will continue indefinitely.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that she was denied due process.  For example, she argues the Judge did\nnot properly ascertain whether her decision to represent herself was knowing and intelligent.  She\nalso states that she did not understand the nature of the proceeding, leaving her unsure about the\nstandard that would be applied to her case.  Throughout her brief, Applicant describes the Judge\u2019s\nconduct of the hearing as confusing, meandering from topic to topic in such a way as to invite\nmisunderstanding and preclude effective self-representation.\n  We are not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s arguments, concluding that they do not accurately\ncharacterize the transcript.  At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant if she had\n\u201cgiven some thought to hiring an attorney,\u201d and she replied, \u201cI did, sir, But I cannot afford it, sir.\u201d \nTr. at 5.  This response demonstrates that Applicant was aware of her right to representation, which\nis set forth in the Directive, a copy of which she received along with the SOR.  The Judge then\nquestioned Applicant in some detail on her educational and work background, concluding from her\nanswers that she was qualified to represent herself.  Tr. at 5-11.  Applicant argues on appeal that the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion was based, in part, on discussions that occurred off the record and, therefore, are\nnot available to us for our appellate review.  We have examined the transcript and discovered no\nindication that off-the-record discussions on this matter took place.  We find nothing that supports\na conclusion that Applicant did not understand her right to representation.  Neither do we find\nanything that shows that her decision to appear pro se was other than knowing and intelligent.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01320 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018).   \nApplicant contends that she did not understand the nature of the proceedings, specifically,\nwhether her hearing was to determine access to public trust information or classified information. \nShe argues that, due to this confusion, she was not adequately apprised of the standard that would\napply in her case.\nIt is true that, at one point in the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant if she understood the\npurpose of the public trust hearing, and Applicant replied that it was in regard to her security\nclearance.  The Judge and Department Counsel consulted with one another and confirmed to\nApplicant that the hearing was, indeed, in regard to a position of trust, as clearly stated in the SOR. \nTr. at 10.  The Judge did not further explain the difference between a security clearance and a\nposition of trust.  However, even if this was an error, it was harmless.  Security Executive Agent\nDirective (SEAD) 4, effective June 8, 2017, contained in Enclosure 2 of the Directive, establishes\ncommon adjudicative criteria for persons seeking access to classified information or eligibility to\nhold a sensitive position.  Therefore, an applicant seeking, for example, a position of trust with a\nDoD contractor will find his or her case evaluated under the same standard and using the same\nguidelines and procedures as apply to security clearance cases.  See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App.\nBd. Aug. 13, 2018).  See also Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013), cert. denied.  In\nlight of this, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s apparent impression that she was seeking a security\n3\n\nclearance was not due to the guidance she received from DOHA or to the Judge\u2019s conduct of the\nhearing.  In any event, this confusion in and of itself likely exerted no meaningful effect on\nApplicant\u2019s ability to prepare for the hearing.\nTurning to the question of Applicant\u2019s actual understanding of the procedures utilized in her\nhearing, we note that the Judge advised her that if she had any questions to ask him and that if she\nrequired a break to gather her thoughts, etc., to let him know.  Tr. at 11.  He described the nature of\nthe hearing and its various parts, for example opening statement, the nature of Department Counsel\u2019s\nexhibits, and the closing argument.  Tr. at 12-13.  These explanations were sufficiently clear to\napprise a reasonable person as to what to expect during the course of the proceeding.  At the\nbeginning of her case in chief, Applicant stated that she had not brought exhibits to the hearing.  Tr.\nat 20.  The Judge subsequently took documents that Applicant had attached to her SOR response,\ndesignated them Applicant Exhibits, and admitted them into evidence as part of Applicant\u2019s\npresentation.  Decision at 2.  In addition, he gave Applicant two weeks after the hearing to submit\nadditional documentation, which she did.  Tr. at 49; Decision at 2.  \nApplicant contends that it was erroneous for the Judge to permit Department Counsel to cross\nexamine her at the beginning of her case in chief, characterizing this as \u201cthe strangest aspect of the\nentire proceeding.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 6.  In point of fact, the Judge asked Applicant if she wished to\naddress the SOR allegations by testifying on her own or by submitting to questioning by Department\nCounsel, and she chose the latter alternative.  Tr. at 20-21.  We find no error in this procedure, which\nis not unusual in DOHA hearings.  Applicant contends that Department Counsel took unfair\nadvantage of her during cross examination, posing questions that contained \u201cloaded language,\u201d\nfurther confusing Applicant and preventing her from meeting her burden of persuasion.  It is true that\na DOHA hearing is adversarial, and a Department Counsel\u2019s job is to present the Government\u2019s\nevidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  In this hearing, however, the Government\u2019s case had already been\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nquestions, which were generally open-ended rather than leading, explored the background of\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties, addressed each debt in some detail, and gave Applicant an\nopportunity to explain what she had done to resolve the debts and otherwise develop the record. \nMoreover, after Department Counsel finished, the Judge asked further questions in clarification of\nthe evidence.  Tr. at 40 et seq.  We find no reason to conclude that the Judge permitted Department\nCounsel to take unfair advantage of Applicant or preclude her from presenting her case effectively. \nAfter examining the record as a whole, we conclude that Applicant was not denied the due process\nafforded by the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017).  Having\nchosen to appear pro se, Applicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of her self-\nrepresentation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-08118 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2013). \nApplicant contends that the Judge exhibited \u201cbiased conduct\u201d at the hearing, resulting in a\ndecision that was arbitrary and capricious.  We find nothing in the record that would persuade a\nreasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite impartiality.  Applicant has not rebutted\nthe presumption that the Judge was unbiased.  See, e.g, ADP Case No. 07-00966 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug.\n24, 2009).  Applicant argues that the Judge erred by permitting a witness to observe the hearing\n4\n\nwithout asking her if she wanted the hearing to be open.  At one point, the Judge noted the presence\nof another person, whom Department Counsel advised was a new Department Counsel who wished\nto observe the proceedings for purposes of training.  She told the Judge that she had previously\nreceived permission from Applicant for this person to be present in the hearing room.  The Judge\nasked, \u201cIs that okay with you, [Applicant]?\u201d and Applicant replied \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sir.\u201d  Tr. at 18-19. \nAccordingly, the Judge did receive Applicant\u2019s permission for the presence of the new employee in\nthe hearing room.  In any event, while he did not specifically ask her if she wanted an open hearing,\na hearing is presumed open unless the applicant requests otherwise, which in this case did not\nhappen.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.12.  The presence of this employee did not impair any right that\nApplicant enjoyed under the Directive.\nApplicant\u2019s attorney reports difficulties in accessing the DOHA website and the current\nDirective.  The Board does not have control over the operation of the website.  We do report\ncomplaints when appropriate.  On this occasion we found the DOHA site generally functional with\nthe current Directive accessible at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/DIRECTIVE%202017.pdf.  Furthermore,\nas noted earlier, the Directive was received by Applicant with the SOR.\nWe resolve the remaining allegations of error adversely to Applicant.  We note Applicant\u2019s\nargument that the ultimate decision was based upon an incomplete record and, therefore, was \narbitrary and capricious.  However, Applicant does not identify any evidence that the Judge\u2019s\npurported errors prevented her from submitting.  The record supports a conclusion that the Judge\nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a\nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEdward O. Lear, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 4, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn May 7, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant submitted a Motion for Reconsideration that the Judge\ngranted.  On July 2, 2019, after receipt of additional evidence, the Judge again denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR listed 18 allegations of financial deficiencies.  These include that Applicant failed\nto file his state income tax return for 2014 prior to the statutory deadline; that he failed to pay his\nstate incomes taxes for 2011-2014 as required; that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns\nfor 2011-2016 prior to the statutory deadlines; that he owed delinquent income taxes to the Federal\nGovernment for 2011-2015 totaling about $39,700; and that he had ten other delinquent debt totaling\nabout $2,570.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation.  In the Decision on\nReconsideration, the Judge found in favor of Applicant on 15 SOR allegations and against him on\nthree delinquent debts totaling about $1,120.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions about the payment of certain\ndebts that were not presented to the Judge for consideration.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from\nconsidering new evidence on appeal.

[Emphasis in Appeal Brief.]\nApplicant\u2019s reliance on \u00b6 6.4, which applies to the temporary suspension of a previously adjudicated\n2\n\nsecurity clearance pending a final clearance decision, is misplaced.  Regarding this issue, we first\nnote that Applicant\u2019s security clearance was not suspended under \u00b6 6.4.  Second, the Judge\u2019s decision\nin this case is an integral part of and, depending on the circumstances, could constitute the final\nclearance decision.1  Third, the \u201cimminent threat to the national security\u201d standard is for use by an\nappropriate DoD official in reviewing a proposed security clearance suspension and not for use by\nJudges in adjudicating security clearance eligibility.

In doing so, he highlights, for example, the actions he has taken to\nresolve his financial problems.  His arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the Judge\nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  We note that the Judge\u2019s key conclusions \u2013 that\nApplicant has a long history of financial problems, that he has not resolved all of the alleged debts,\nand that he has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely \u2013 are sustainable on the\nrecord. \nAs we have previously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows\nthe parties and the Board to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or\nshe is reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018).  Based on our\nreview, the Judge\u2019s decision in this case creates some ambiguity.  As noted above, the Judge found\nin favor of Applicant on 15 SOR allegations and against him on three debts totaling about $1,120. \nIn general, a Judge\u2019s favorable finding on an SOR allegation tends to indicate that he or she\nconcluded the allegation no longer raises a security concern.  In this case, the Judge specifically\nconcluded that Applicant had a history of financial problems and failed to establish that those\nproblems are unlikely to recur.  The extent to which the Judge relied on the favorable SOR findings\nto reach those conclusions is unknown.2  While Applicant notes in his appeal brief that the Judge\nonly found against him on three allegations totaling less than $1,200, he did not specifically claim\nthose unfavorable findings standing alone were insufficient to raise security concerns.  As discussed\n1 See, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.36.  Because Applicant appealed the Judge\u2019s decision, our decision constitutes the final\nclearance decision.  \n2 Even if debts have been paid, removed, rendered uncollectable by operations of law, or are otherwise resolved,\na Judge may still consider the underlying circumstances of an applicant\u2019s financial difficulties in evaluating whether he\nor she has demonstrated good judgment and reliability.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00192 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,\n2018). \n3\n\nabove, we concluded the record when viewed as a whole does support the Judge\u2019s adverse\nconclusions.  Given these circumstances, we conclude that no benefit would be gained by remanding\nthe decision to the Judge to clarify the extent to which he may have relied on the favorable findings\nin rendering his adverse decision.\nApplicant has failed to demonstrate harmful error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision.\n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned; Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned; James E.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue in her appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in her 40s, has worked for Federal contractors since about 1997.  She was\nunemployed from about May to December 2007 and for brief periods in 2015 and 2017.  She has\nworked in her current position since early 2017.  She is married with a minor child, adult child, and\nadult stepchild.  She was first granted a security clearance in about 1996.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her Federal income tax returns for 2012-2016\nin a timely manner and that she owes about $6,200 in state income taxes for 2012 and 2013.  She\nadmitted both SOR allegations.  She attributed her tax filing deficiency to the unforeseen firing of\nher husband from his long-time job, which resulted in their annual income dropping from about\n$200,000 to $90,000.  She also assisted her stepson by paying his legal fees that arose from criminal\ncharges and by assisting him and his mother with their housing for a period.  Additionally, Applicant\nnoted she had health problems, her children experienced bullying and assaults, and one child had\nbehavioral issues.  She testified she notified Federal and state tax authorities about the circumstances\nimpeding her ability to address her tax issues and that she was overwhelmed by those circumstances. \n  \nApplicant did not prioritize her legal obligation to file her tax returns.  She believed that she\ndid not owe any taxes on the unfiled tax returns and thought she was only delaying the receipt of \ntax refunds.  She did not consider the impact the tax filing deficiencies would have on her security\nclearance.  In her security clearance application (SCA), she disclosed that she traveled overseas in\n2014 and 2015 for pleasure.  She filed her 2012-2017 Federal and state income tax returns in January\n2019.  She acknowledged that completing her 2017 SCA prompted her to file her tax returns.  \nApplicant testified that her 2012 and 2013 state tax returns were filed by the state after she\nfailed to file them.  She elected to pay the state tax delinquency of about $8,000 to $9,000 through\n2\n\na payment plan that began in December 2016.  In 2018, the state also filed her delinquent 2014 and\n2015 state tax returns and added the past-due state taxes for those years to her payment plan.  Subject\nto possible IRS adjustments, Applicant had no outstanding state tax liability by January 2019. \n \nApplicant was not late in filing her 2018 Federal and state income tax returns.  Her and her\nhusband\u2019s annual income was back to approximately $200,000.  They have about $6,200 in savings\nand about $140,000 of equity in their home.  She described her current financial situation as \u201cpretty\ngood.\u201d  Decision at 4.  They have no other delinquent debts.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified she is\ntrustworthy individual who exercises good judgment.  Another witness testified that she is a\ndedicated worker and reliable individual. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant is working to provide the IRS additional documentation to complete the filing of\nher 2014 Federal income tax return.  Her financial problems were not infrequent and did not happen\nso long ago or under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  Conditions beyond her control\ncontributed to her financial problems, but she did not take prompt action to resolve them.  The mere\nfiling of past-due tax returns or resolution of delinquent debts does not compel a favorable security\nclearance adjudication. Although certain mitigating conditions were established, Applicant\u2019s\nproblems continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nDiscussion    \nApplicant contends that the Judge gave insufficient weight to her mitigating evidence and\ndid not properly apply the whole-person concept.  In her brief, she reiterates the circumstances that\nthe Judge discussed for her financial problems and argues those circumstances were overwhelming\nand are unlikely to recur.   She also asserts, among other matters, that she made a valiant effort to\nresolve her financial problems, has learned from this experience, and has filed her delinquent returns. \nWe do not finding Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\nThe thrust of the Judge\u2019s decision is that Applicant did not act responsibly under the\ncircumstances to resolve her financial problems.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems covered multiple\nyears.  The state filed her missing state tax returns for certain years and initiated action to collect her\npast-due state taxes.  Additionally, Applicant acknowledged that completing her 2017 security\nclearance application spurred her on to resolve her tax filing deficiency.  The Judge noted that an\napplicant\u2019s resolution of his or her financial problems does not compel a favorable security clearance\nadjudication and that the timing of corrective action is an important factor to consider because\napplicants who wait until their security clearances are in jeopardy before resolving financial\nproblems may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018).        \nApplicant\u2019s arguments fail to show the Judge committed any harmful error.  The presence\nof some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\n3\n\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\n The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 29, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline K (Handling\nProtected Information), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 30, 2019,\nafter the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E.\nCurry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s\nadverse decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Finding of Fact and Analysis\nFrom the early 1990s to 2014, Applicant regularly masturbated in public, including in public\nparks, the sauna at a gym, and once on a military base near the post exchange.  Up to 2009, he would\nengage in that behavior about four or five times a week.  On a quarterly basis from about 2002 to\n2011, he sunbathed naked in a park and eventually began exercising there in the nude.   He also\nwalked around his home naked with the shutters open.   If his young female neighbor saw him, he\nhad an innocent explanation, i.e., that he was home.  He has not engaged in sexually aberrant\nbehavior since November 2014.  He recognizes this conduct was foolish and has no desire to engage\nin it again.  He has neither told his wife about this conduct nor obtained any therapy to address it. \nWhile working for another employer in about 2000, Applicant knowingly took home a\nclassified computer disk two or three times.  He placed the classified computer disk into his home\ncomputer to finish office work.  \u201cWhen asked at the hearing to explain why he never informed his\nemployer of the security violations, he answered, \u2018no harm, no foul.\u2019\u201d Decision at 3.  \nIn 2010, Applicant intentionally failed to divulge his security violations during a background\ninterview.  He failed to disclose that information because he was embarrassed and was afraid it\nwould jeopardize his chances for obtaining a security clearance.  He disclosed that information\nduring a 2014 interview. \nAlthough Applicant has not engaged in sexually aberrant behavior in nearly five years, he\nhas not informed his wife about that behavior or sought therapy.  His failure to disclose his security\nviolation for nearly 14 years and \u201chis nonchalant attitude about the significance of the security\nviolations renders any of the [Guideline K] mitigating conditions inapplicable.\u201d  Decision at 5.  His\nexplanations for failure to disclose derogatory information during background interviews do not\n\nmitigate the Guideline E security concerns.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant admitted each SOR allegation and has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s findings\nof fact on appeal.  In his brief, Applicant indicates that he does not agree with the Judge\u2019s decision\nand questions whether the Judge thoroughly considered the evidence presented at his hearing.  In his\narguments, he points to such matters as the passage of time since his last misconduct, that he\ndivulged his misconduct during a second polygraph and subsequent interviews, that his security\nviolation did not involve sensitive Government data, and that he has participated in numerous\nsecurity briefings since his security violations.

Applicant\nfurther contends, \u201cI find it sufficient to simply acknowledge my personal misconduct and security\nviolation, but not be required to provide details beyond what I acknowledge and that this\nacknowledgment not be considered in obtaining any future clearance or update to any clearance to\ninclude Polys.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2.  This contention is frivolous.  The Board is bound by the\nprocedures and guidelines set forth in the Directive.  Applicants do not set the rules or procedures\nfor security clearance investigations or adjudications.   \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

On\nApril 17, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October\n31, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nMichael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in admitting\nevidence; whether the Judge denied Applicant due process; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant works for a Defense contractor.  He also is employed by a U.S. agency.  It is in\nhis capacity as a contractor that he has applied for a clearance, although the circumstances that form\nthe basis of this adjudication arose during the course of his agency employment.  Applicant began\nworking for the U.S. government in early 2015.  He previously served in the U.S. military,\ndeploying three times to the Middle East.\nWhen Applicant met his current spouse, he was not aware that she was a foreign national\nresiding in the U.S.  Rather, he believed that she was a U.S. citizen.  When he discovered otherwise,\nhe disclosed his relationship to the appropriate authorities within the agency that employed him. \nApplicant\u2019s employer initiated removal against him, based upon his association with his now-wife. \nAlthough the agency characterized Applicant\u2019s conduct as \u201cvery serious\u201d and \u201cdirectly related\u201d to\nhis employment, it mitigated the removal to a suspension without pay.  It did so in view of\nApplicant\u2019s clean disciplinary record, good job performance, and his having successfully sought\npermanent resident alien status for his wife.\nIn addition to his wife, Applicant has ongoing contact with his wife\u2019s parents-in-law and\nbrother in law.  His mother-in-law, a Mexican citizen, resides in the U.S. as an undocumented alien. \nHis brother-in-law\u2019s status is unclear due to the Deferred Action for Child Arrival program.  His\nfather-in-law is also from Mexico.  Though he has an alien registration number, the father-in-law\nis pending deportation action through an immigration court.  Applicant\u2019s weekly contact with his\nin-laws is at family dinners.  In addition, his mother-in-law provides child care for Applicant and\nhis wife.  Applicant disclosed these circumstances in his security clearance application (SCA) and\nduring his background investigation.  Applicant\u2019s in-laws were not included in the adverse action\nthat his agency lodged against him.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s ongoing association with undocumented aliens, i.e.,\nhis mother-in-law and brother-in-law, raises a concern under Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 16(d),\nbecause that association poses \u201can obvious conflict of interest with his responsibilities\u201d  as a federal\n2\n\nemployee.  Decision at 8. Regarding Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, he stated that the nature of\nApplicant\u2019s agency duties might allow him potentially to gain access to information about his in-\nlaws status, especially regarding his father-in-law\u2019s potential deportation.  Applicant\u2019s\n\u201ccircumstances create the potential for an insider threat, which is a major concern of the federal\ngovernment\u2019s risk management program.\u201d  Id.  Though acknowledging Applicant\u2019s military service\nand his understandable loyalties to his family, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s association with illegal\naliens raised concerns that his evidence was not sufficient to mitigate.\nDiscussion\nEvidentiary Ruling  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by admitting Government Exhibit (GE) 4, a\ndocument whereby he informed his agency of his relationship with his now-wife.  He argues that\nthis document is not relevant because it references only Applicant\u2019s wife, who was not mentioned\nin the SOR.  Moreover, he notes that at the time he prepared the document, he was not married and,\ntherefore, had no in-laws to disclose.  We conclude that this exhibit was relevant to matters properly\nbefore the Judge, including but not limited to a consideration of the whole-person concept.  The\nchallenged evidentiary ruling was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).\nDue Process\nApplicant contends that the Judge denied him due process.  He notes first that the SCA which\nis the basis for Applicant\u2019s adjudication was prepared in regard to his duties as a Defense contractor. \nHowever, the SOR alleged circumstances pertaining to his agency employment.  He contends that\nthe Judge erroneously found his job with the agency to be \u201cmore important and relevant\u201d than his\nsecurity clearance eligibility with the contractor.  He argues that the Judge erred by focusing on a\nconflict of interest involving Applicant\u2019s agency job rather than addressing his job with a contractor. \nWe have considered this assignment of error in light of the record and conclude that the challenged\nanalysis does not call into question whether Applicant received due process, in that it addressed\nthings that were within the explicit scope of the SOR.  See footnote 1 below.  The Directive does\nnot prohibit security officials from considering conduct unrelated to an applicant\u2019s current\nemployment by a contractor when that conduct raises concerns about the applicant\u2019s ability to\nprotect classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04190 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2017), in\nwhich an applicant was denied a clearance due to conduct during a previous job rather than the one\nhe held at the time of his clearance application.      \n \nApplicant also argues that he was denied due process because he did not have sufficient time\nto prepare for the case.  He notes that the SOR originally alleged that he knowingly associated with\n3\n\nhis in-laws, who were engaged in criminal activity and illegally present in the U.S.  However, at the\nbeginning of the hearing, the Judge granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the allegation\nto delete reference to criminality.1  Tr. at 24.   Applicant\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that he\nhad not had time to prepare to meet the allegation as amended.  The Judge asked how much time he\nwould need, specifically if Applicant wanted to reschedule the case for a later time.  Eventually\ncounsel stated that he would proceed without rescheduling, citing added financial costs of a\ncontinuance.  After so stating, he withdrew the objection.  Tr. at 23-24.  At the end of the hearing\nthe Judge gave Applicant an additional week to submit evidence regarding the amended allegation. \nTr. at 107.  \nWe conclude that the Judge did not deny Applicant a fair opportunity to prepare his case. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.17 provides that the SOR may be amended by the Judge at the hearing for good\ncause and that the Judge may grant a request for additional time for further preparation.  Neither at\nthe hearing nor on appeal has Applicant contended that there was no good cause for the amendment. \nRather, he simply argues inadequate preparation time.  Even if he had not waived this issue by\nwithdrawing the objection, the issue is groundless.  The Judge was willing to entertain a request for\na continuance, which Applicant declined to seek.  Even so, he granted Applicant a week after the\nhearing to submit additional evidence.  One day after the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel advised the\nJudge by email as follows: \u201cI appreciate your offer but [Applicant] does not need any additional\ntime to respond to the modified SOR[.]\u201d Email from Applicant\u2019s Counsel to Judge, dated September\n21, 2018 (emphasis added).  The Judge did not abuse his discretion in the manner in which he\namended the SOR.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00019 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2014).  In particular\nhe did not fail to observe the requirement of the Directive that he grant either party\u2019s request for\nadditional preparation time, insofar as neither party, particularly Applicant, led him to believe that\nsuch time was needed.  Applicant may be unhappy with the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions, but he was\nnot denied the due process afforded by the Directive.\nWhether the Decision is Arbitrary, Capricious, or Contrary to  Law\nApplicant contends that the Judge employed the wrong adjudicative factors in evaluating his\ncase.  Noting the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his relationship with undocumented relatives posed a\nconflict of interest with his duties at his agency employment, he argues that Guideline E \u201cdoes not\naddress any so-called concerns about a conflict of interest.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 12.  He argues that the\nJudge improperly applied a Guideline B criterion in his treatment of Guideline E.\nIt is true that Guideline B, which focuses upon the extent to which an applicant might be\nsubject to influence by or on behalf of a foreign country, embraces circumstances in which foreign\n1The SOR allegation originally read as follows: \u201cYou have knowingly continued to associate with your mother-\nin-law and brother-in-law despite their criminal activity and illegal presence in the United States.\u201d  The amended\nallegation, re-designated 1.a, read as follows: \u201cYou have knowingly continued to associate with your mother-in-law and\nbrother-in-law even after learning that they are illegal aliens residing in the United States.\u201d  The amendment included\nthe deletion in toto of an original allegation 1.a that was in essence duplicative of the one just quoted.  It left a third\nallegation untouched, except that it was re-designated 1.b rather than its previous designation of 1.c.  This allegation\nstated, in effect, that Applicant associated with his in-laws despite his employment by the agency.   \n4\n\nrelatives might pose a conflict of interest between an applicant\u2019s concern for these relatives and his\nor her duty to protect classified information.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App A \u00b6 7(b).  It is also true that\nthe disqualifying conditions listed under Guideline E do not make explicit reference to conflicts of\ninterest.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 15 - 17. However, the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions set forth under each guideline of the Directive are illustrative, not exclusive.  They\nprovide an analytical framework for decision-making but are not to be applied in the strict manner\nrequired of criminal statutes.  In fact, it is not improper for a Judge to conclude that none of the\nlisted disqualifying conditions strictly apply yet nevertheless find that an applicant\u2019s conduct raises\nconcerns under the guideline at issue.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 14-03701 at 2-3 (Apr. 12, 2017).  \n  \nIn light of the above, we see no reason to conclude that conflicts of interest involving foreign\ncitizens are to be addressed exclusively under Guideline B and not elsewhere, such as Guideline E.\nThis latter guideline states, in pertinent part, that \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment . . . or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6 15.  Although much of Guideline E addresses false statements or omissions, it is broad enough\nto include other things.   In the case before us, Applicant works for an agency that enforces\nimmigration policy.  He has an ongoing relationship with foreign citizens who are living in this\ncountry in violation of that policy.  This does indeed suggest a possible conflict of interest, not due\nto the foreign citizenship per se of his relatives but to their presence in the U.S. unsanctioned by the\nlaws Applicant\u2019s agency enforces.  Characterized in this way, this sort of conflict does not\nnecessarily fall under Guideline B, but it does call Applicant\u2019s judgment into question, a central\nconcern of Guideline E.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-10307 (App. Bd. Jul. 18, 2012), in which\nforeign contacts were alleged both under Guideline B and Guideline E.   \nIndeed, Applicant\u2019s own exhibit, the memorandum setting forth his agency\u2019s decision\nregarding his proposed removal, advised him that his ongoing relationship with his then-girlfriend\nwas \u201cvery serious[.]\u201d  It went on to state, \u201cYour actions call your personal judgment into question\nand directly contradict the expectation that federal employees uphold the responsibility of complying\nwith federal statutes, rules, regulations, and policies established by the Agency.\u201d  Applicant Exhibit\nC.  Given that Applicant\u2019s relationship with the person who became his wife called into question\nhis willingness to abide by rules and regulations, the Judge did not err in examining whether\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing relationship with foreign in-laws, who had even less legal status than his wife,\nposed a similar concern.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that these relationships impugn Applicant\u2019s\nwillingness to follow rules and regulations\u2013not only those of his agency but those that govern the\nhandling of classified information\u2013constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the record that was\nbefore him.  Applicant\u2019s circumstances satisfy the overarching criteria of Guideline E, and we find\nno error in the manner in which the Judge evaluated the security concerns raised by the SOR.\nAfter considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief in light of the record as a whole,\nwe conclude that he has not demonstrated that the Judge committed any harmful error.  To the\ncontrary, the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\n5\n\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 23, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn April 11, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge erred in his findings\nof fact and (2) whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is married with two children.  He pays child support for one of them.  He served\nhonorably in the military and has held a security clearance since 1996.\nThe SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts, including judgments, that total about $104,000.  In his\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied five of the debts because he was not familiar with them and\nadmitted the others.  The debts became delinquent between 2011 and 2017, and the judgments were\nfiled between 2012 and 2014.  \nIn 2013, Applicant experienced a reduction in his annual earning from $114,000 to $90,000 \nwhen his employer, a defense contractor, changed.  In February 2014, he was laid off from his job,\nbegan working in a temporary position in July, and was hired for his present position in August of\nthat year.  His current annual earnings are $105,000.   He attributed his financial problems to his pay\nreduction in 2013 and his unemployment in 2014.   \nApplicant paid one alleged debt through a garnishment in 2016 and 2017.  In 2018, he filed\nChapter 13 bankruptcy to prevent his home from being foreclosed.  He has made three payments\ntotaling about $2,100 under the bankruptcy.  His bankruptcy payments will increase over time to\nmore than $2,000 a month, which he currently cannot afford.  He anticipates that he will be able to\nafford the payments once he successfully negotiates a home loan modification and renegotiates a new\nChapter 13 plan.  He believes all of the SOR debts are listed in his bankruptcy; however, one is not\nlisted.    \nApplicant\u2019s debts are numerous and ongoing.  Due to a lack of evidence showing actions to\naddress the debts before his bankruptcy, his debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  He encountered unforeseen events that negatively impacted\nhis financial situation, but failed to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nDespite filing bankruptcy, he has not shown his financial problems are under control.  In the whole-\nperson analysis, the Judge noted that \u201c[h]aving been fully employed for more than four years, it is\nreasonable to expect that Applicant would have taken more responsible and timely action to address\nthe listed debts.\u201d  Decision at 7.  The Judge found against Applicant on all of the alleged debts.\n2\n\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the Judge erred in various findings of facts.  Whenever a Judge\u2019s findings\nof fact are challenged, we examine them to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e.,\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  In this case, Applicant, for example, points out that\nthe Judge stated in the synopsis of the decision that he was laid off for three months in 2014 when\nhe was actually laid off for six and a half months.  In the findings of fact, however, the Judge\naccurately listed the time period that Applicant was unemployed as reflected in his security clearance\napplication (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) and his testimony (Tr. at 8, 30-31, and 34-35).  Applicant\nalso challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that one of the SOR debts was not listed in his bankruptcy. \nApplicant is correct that the debt in question was listed in Schedule G - Executory Contracts and\nUnexpired Leases of the bankruptcy petition.  Applicant further notes that he has a daughter and son\nas opposed to the Judge\u2019s finding that he has two daughters.  Although Applicant has pointed out\nsome errors, none of them merit any corrective action.  Even when considered collectively, the errors\nare harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013)(An error is harmless\nif it did not likely affect the outcome of the case). \nApplicant also requests that, if we decide to affirm the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision, we grant him a favorable public trust determination.  We have no authority to grant  that\nrequest.  The Appeal Board neither has fact-finding authority nor authority to change the nature of\nthe adjudication below.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02394 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015).  We also\nnote that the adjudicative guidelines applied in this case are used whether a case is a security\nclearance adjudication or public trust adjudication (i.e., a \u201csensitive position\u201d adjudication).  See\nDirective, Encl. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 B, C, D.8, and E; and Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 1.  Additionally, Applicant requests that\nwe waive the one-year bar for reapplying for a public trust position following an adverse decision. \nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.37.  We have no authority to waive the one-year reapplication bar.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 08-08606 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009).   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  These arguments, however, are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). \n \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nApril 20, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On December 7, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for a Defense contractor since late 2015.  He served on active duty in\nthe military from 1986 until 1999 and then entered the Reserves, from which he retired as an O-5. \nAfter leaving active duty he worked for Federal contractors.  He first received a security clearance\nin 1991 while in the military and has held jobs requiring him to have access to sensitive\ncompartmented information (SCI).  \nApplicant\u2019s security-significant conduct involved him engaging the services of prostitutes\nabout five times\u2013twice while in the military and three times thereafter.  The last incident occurred\nin 2015.  Several of these incidents occurred while Applicant held a clearance.  During a 2015\npolygraph administered by another Government agency in connection with renewal of his SCI\naccess, Applicant admitted that he had engaged the services of prostitutes.  As a consequence of\nthese admissions, the agency revoked Applicant\u2019s SCI access.  Applicant reapplied for a clearance\nin 2017.1  He had not previously disclosed his conduct with prostitutes because he had not\nundergone a lifestyle polygraph and because the questions on his security clearance applications\ninquired only about criminal conduct for which he was arrested or charged.  Although Applicant has\ndisclosed his conduct to his immediate family and to a close friend, he has not told his employer\nabout it because he is embarrassed.\nApplicant attributed his early interactions with prostitutes to his being \u201cyoung and stupid.\u201d \nDecision at 3.  Regarding the later ones, he claimed that he had experienced periods of stress\u2013the\ndeath of his father, a failed romantic relationship, involuntary termination from a job\u2013that affected\nhis judgment.  Applicant self-referred to counseling and was advised to attend Sex Addicts\nAnonymous (SA), a twelve-step program analogous to Alcoholics Anonymous.  He initially attended\nmeetings three times a month but now does so by telephone twice a month.  He has a sponsor and\nhas served as a sponsor for others.  Applicant supplied no information about his counseling, nor did\nhe provide references from his SA sponsor or others with knowledge about his effort at recovery. \nHe did submit information about his participation in a support group for soldiers dealing with post-\n1In his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that his SCI access had been revoked by another government agency\nfollowing a polygraph.  \n2\n\ntraumatic stress disorder, but he has not been diagnosed with this condition, and it is not clear how\nhis involvement with this group affected his recovery.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge noted that three years had passed since Applicant\u2019s last offense.  However, he\nstated that even more years had intervened between some of his earlier incidents, thereby impairing\nApplicant\u2019s ability to show that his incidents were mitigated by the passage of time.  The Judge\nconcluded that the stressors that Applicant had undergone were not so unusual as to explain or\njustify his security significant conduct.  He also noted a paucity of corroboration regarding\nApplicant\u2019s testimony about his counseling and SA attendance.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters from outside the record.  We are not permitted to consider\nnew evidence in resolving an appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant cites to a Hearing Office case\nin his Appeal Brief that he believes supports his effort to get a clearance.  Each case must be decided\non its own merits.  Hearing Office decisions are not binding on other Hearing Office Judge\u2019s or on\nthe Appeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2018).  Moreover,\nthe favorable decision that Applicant cites was reversed on appeal.  ISCR Case No. 16-03763 (App.\nBd. Nov. 20, 2018).  \nApplicant cites to a statement by the Judge that Applicant had engaged the services of\nprostitutes on six occasions, whereas the record only demonstrated five.  This comment is found\nonly in the Judge\u2019s summary of the case, at the very beginning of the Decision.  His findings of fact\ndo not reference six offenses, nor does his analysis.  Indeed, the Judge\u2019s findings are consistent with\nthe record that was before him.  To the extent that the challenged statement is an error, it did not\nlikely affect the outcome of the case.  Therefore, it is harmless.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-01181\nat 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018).\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief is, in essence, a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  However, an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not\nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.2    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd.

He does not state,\nhowever, that he ever notified the Appeal Board or any other DOHA official about his failure to receive a transcript, and\nthere is nothing in the record to show that he had brought this to our attention prior to submitting his Appeal Brief.  As\na consequence, we conclude that Applicant has forfeited any due process issue that he is raising.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 12-01906 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd.

He has held a clearance for thirty years without incident or concern. Applicant began consuming alcohol at age sixteen. He became a social drinker while in the military and had no problems with alcohol during his service. However, after he retired, he experienced marital problems, and he increased his consumption of alcohol to cope. He drank to self-medicate, and his family and others told him that he had a problem. In 2009, he underwent thirty days of inpatient alcohol treatment at a Veterans Administration medical clinic. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and recommended to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, though there was no other aftercare program. Applicant remained sober for a year. Applicant relapsed in 2010, after his wife told him that she wanted a divorce. In addition, he moved to a new state in order to take a job; close family members died, including his father; two friends still on active duty were killed while serving overseas; and two friends took their own lives. As a consequence, Applicant resumed drinking. In 2014, he entered another thirty-day inpatient treatment program, in which he was again diagnosed with alcohol dependence.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May\n10, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 26, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant served in the U.S. military from 1987 to 2007, retiring as an 0-5.  During his career\nhe deployed seven times, four of which were to combat zones.  He has held a clearance for thirty\nyears without incident or concern.\nApplicant began consuming alcohol at age sixteen.  He became a social drinker while in the\nmilitary and had no problems with alcohol during his service.  However, after he retired, he\nexperienced marital problems, and he increased his consumption of alcohol to cope.  He drank to\nself-medicate, and his family and others told him that he had a problem.  In 2009, he underwent\nthirty days of inpatient alcohol treatment at a Veterans Administration medical clinic.  He was\ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence and recommended to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, though\nthere was no other aftercare program.  Applicant remained sober for a year.\n Applicant relapsed in 2010, after his wife told him that she wanted a divorce.  In addition,\nhe moved to a new state in order to take a job; close family members died, including his father; two\nfriends still on active duty were killed while serving overseas; and two friends took their own lives. \nAs a consequence, Applicant resumed drinking.  In 2014, he entered another thirty-day inpatient\ntreatment program, in which he was again diagnosed with alcohol dependence.  After this treatment\nhe was sober for about a year and a half.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter moved in with him and did not get along with his live-in girlfriend,\nwho was abusing prescription drugs.  He advised his counselor about his relapse.  Applicant began\nfollowing his counselor\u2019s advice, sleeping regularly, exercising, and eating a proper diet.  He\ncurrently does not have a sponsor but does believe that he has a strong support system.  He plans to\nseek out a therapist for one-on-one counseling in the near future.  He has not consumed alcohol in\nabout two years.  He has no intention of resuming drinking.\nHe states that he was not aware of his two diagnoses of alcohol dependence.  He states that\nhe was only advised to avoid alcohol abuse and to avoid situations that might trigger him to drink. \nApplicant was evaluated by a physician, who characterized his program as strong and concluded that\n2\n\nhis alcohol dependence is currently in remission.  Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation\nin 2018, receiving a diagnosis of alcohol abuse in remission.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his trustworthiness and reliability, as well as his\nprofessionalism and work ethic.  He is described as articulate and intelligent.  His friends and\ncolleagues recommend that he retain his clearance.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence of mitigation.  She\nnoted that he has been sober for about two years.   However, she concluded that, given the extent\nof his problem, including multiple relapses, these two years are not enough to show that his security-\nsignificant conduct is behind him.  In the whole-person analysis, the Judge acknowledged the\ndifficulties Applicant has faced that underlie his alcohol problem.  She pointed out that Applicant\nhad undergone two inpatient alcohol treatment programs that diagnosed him as alcohol dependent,\nbut, after a short period of sobriety, he returned to drinking.  \u201cThere is no strong evidence in the\nrecord to show that he will remain sober for any period more than a year or two, if that long.\u201d  \nDecision at 7.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant cites to various aspects of the record that he believes the Judge did not consider\nor that she failed properly to weigh.  These include his divorce, the deaths of several persons closest\nto him, the contentious relationship between his daughter and his girlfriend, his extensive sobriety,\nhis current sobriety, and his recent professional assessment.  The Judge made findings about these\nthings and discussed many of them in her analysis.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that\nthe Judge considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00109 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 12, 2018). \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s comment that there is no strong evidence that he will\nremain sober for a year or two, if that long.  He notes that the Judge herself found that Applicant has\nbeen sober for two years and intends to remain so, arguing that the  challenged  comment is arbitrary\nand capricious.  However, evidence that Applicant has twice been diagnosed as alcohol dependent\nand twice has failed to maintain sobriety, along with the Judge\u2019s finding that he currently does not\nhave a sponsor and intends to obtain counseling sometime in the future, support her overall\nconclusion that Applicant has not demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation to overcome the security\nconcerns in his case.  Therefore, any error in the challenged statement is harmless, in that it did not\nlikely affect the overall outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.\n30, 2018).\nWe give due consideration to the hearing office cases that Applicant has cited.  However,\neach case must be decided on its own merits.  Hearing Office cases are not binding on other Hearing\nOffice Judges or on the Appeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 29,\n2018).  The gravamen of Applicant\u2019s brief is a challenge to the manner in which the Judge weighed\n3\n\nthe evidence.  An ability to argue for a different interpretation of the record is not enough to show\nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).1  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in\nfavor of the national security.\u201d\n1Applicant argues that the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  We have considered Applicant\u2019s argument\nin light of the entirety of the record.  We conclude that Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge was\nunbiased.

The Judge resolved the loans in Applicant\u2019s favor, although he found against\nher on other allegations, which were for a medical expense and for various collection accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes a substantial amount of information from outside the record, which we\ncannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  She cites to various personal circumstances that affected her\nfinancial problems and contends that her debts do not reflect poorly upon her character.  To the\nextent that she is arguing that the Judge failed properly to weigh the evidence, we conclude that\nApplicant has not shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd.

This paragraph states, among other things, that financial\ndistress can be caused or exacerbated by other issues of security concern, such as those difficulties\nthat Applicant mentions in her brief.  However, that aspect of the Guideline F security concern was\nnot raised in Applicant\u2019s case.  As she states, there is nothing in the record to suggest that she abuses\nalcohol, gambles, or has mental health difficulties.  Rather, the aspect of the concern that the Judge\ndiscussed was that Applicant\u2019s apparent inability to satisfy debts and her history of not meeting\nfinancial problems raised questions about her judgement and reliability.1  This was reasonable, in\nlight of the record that was before him.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s treatment of the\ndisqualifying conditions.\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Borgstrom denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant  raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He is married with two\nchildren and has earned a doctorate degree.  \nFor over three years, Applicant worked in a laboratory.  To install hardware or software on\nhis lab computers, he was required to have IT personnel input a password in the computer, and he\nfound these procedure overly protracted.  In 2012, he acquired a key-logging device to capture the\npassword surreptitiously.  He did not scan the device for viruses or other corruption software.  He\nlater captured the password from an IT representative without his or her knowledge.  Applicant\nsubsequently used the stolen password on about 12 occasions to install hardware and software onto\nthe lab computer without authorization.      \nApplicant explained that he circumvented the security procedures in the interest of\norganizational efficiency.  He did not share the password with anyone or install any hardware or\nsoftware that would have been prohibited.  He never received any security training, although he was\naware of the procedures for installing hardware or software.  He never informed his employer of his\nuse of the key-logging device.  He disclosed its use on his 2012 security clearance application\n(SCA).\nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisors, coworkers, and friends.  He did not disclose\nhis misconduct to his former employer due to embarrassment.  He sincerely regrets his misconduct,\nbut characterizes it as minor.\n \nIn deceiving IT personnel to capture the password and using it without authorization,\nApplicant repeatedly violated IT security procedures.  This put his former employer\u2019s IT systems\nat risk.  While he contends he acted in the interest of organizational efficiency, he did so for his own\nconvenience.  \u201cIf his actions were done in the name of organizational efficiency, he would not have\nacted surreptitiously or felt the need to continue to conceal his past misconduct from his former and\ncurrent employer.  His ongoing concealment of his actions continues his former employer\u2019s exposure\n2\n\nto malware, viruses, etc.  Applicant\u2019s conduct constituted a serious breach of trust and reflected poor\njudgment.\u201d  Decision at 4-5. \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues the Judge did not fairly weigh the evidence.  For\nexample, he contends he had no security training at the time of the alleged conduct; he did not\nknowingly or intentionally put the former employer\u2019s IT system at risk; he engaged in the conduct\nso that he could do his job more effectively and efficiently; his concealment of the conduct from his\nformer employer did not invalidate his motive; his conduct was minor and, to his knowledge, never\nharmed the computer system; and he disclosed the conduct on his SCA.  He also contends the Judge\ninadequately applied the whole-person concept by ignoring evidence of his good judgment and\ncharacter.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to\nmake a favorable security clearance decision.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).\nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant\u2019s responses and his demeanor at that point in the hearing suggested that\nhe may not have been completely candid in answering questions about who paid his tuition and\nliving expenses for four years of graduate education while he was studying for his two master\u2019s\ndegrees in the United States.\u201d  Id.   \nApplicant\u2019s sister is employed at a public educational institution in Taiwan.  In his security\nclearance application (SCA), he indicated that he communicates with her monthly; however, he\ntestified his contact with her is much less.  His wife\u2019s parents and siblings are citizens and residents\nof Taiwan.  She maintains a close relationship with her family.  Her parents are retired.  Her sister\nworks in the financial industry, and her brother is a salesman.    \nUnder the \u201cOne-China\u201d policy, the United States recognizes China as the sole legal\ngovernment over its territory, including Taiwan.  The U.S. enjoys a positive unofficial relationship\nwith Taiwan.  The United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese\nintelligence operations.  China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected information and\nChinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic espionage.  \u201cChina\u2019s collection\n2\n\nactivities include the use of Chinese nationals, such as students and researchers to act as procurement\nagents or intermediaries.\u201d  Decision at 5.  Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic\ntechnologies that has sensitive military applications.  Numerous cases have arisen involving the\nillegal export or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation and a potential\nconflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information and\nhis desire to help family members.  His relationship with foreign persons is close, continuing, and\npresents serious security concerns.  He presented evidence of limited ties to the United States.  He\nbecame a U.S. citizen about five months before he applied for a security clearance.  Applicant has\nrenounced his Taiwanese citizenship, but such action does not outweigh the alleged security\nconcerns.  The Judge found for Applicant on an allegation involving three Taiwanese friends and\nagainst him on the allegations involving his Taiwanese family members.\nDiscussion\nIn noting that English is not his native language, Applicant states that he uses different ways\nto explain himself and provides as much background information as possible to make sure people\nunderstand him.  He contends that the Judge used his manner of explaining matters as basis for\nconcluding he was not candid in answering questions about who paid for his post-graduate education\nand for deducing that he tried to avoid answering questions on that subject.  He argues that he was\ntrying to provide \u201cmore information\u201d so that the Judge would understand what he was saying and\nasserts that it was unfair for the Judge to use his manner of explaining himself against him.  Appeal\nBrief at 1.  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 provides that the Appeal Board shall give deference to a Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determination.  From our review of the record and the Judge\u2019s sustainable findings about\ninconsistent statements, the Judge\u2019s credibility determination is not undermined by sufficient\ncontrary evidence to set aside that deference.  To the extent that Applicant is raising an issue of due\nprocess, we note there is nothing in the record that would prompt a reasonable person to question\nApplicant\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings or to represent himself.  Moreover, we find nothing\nin the record that would persuade a reasonable person to conclude the Judge lacked impartially. \nThese is no reason to conclude that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the Directive. \n \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[A]pplicant provided no documentary\nevidence or testimony of his other financial ties to the United States.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1, quoting\nDecision at 5.  He argues that, if requested, he could provide bank statements and other financial\ninformation to show he has strong financial ties to the United States.  As provided in Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15, Applicant\u2019s opportunity for presenting witnesses and other evidence to mitigate the alleged\nsecurity concerns was during the hearing .  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29 provides that the Appeal Board\ncannot receive or consider new evidence on appeal.  \n \nApplicant further inquires as to what other evidence he could have presented to mitigate the\nalleged security concern.  It is not appropriate for the Appeal Board to provide advice to applicants\n3\n\nabout what evidence they could or should have presented at a hearing.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 18-\n00329 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2018).1   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a challenge to the way in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  Those arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-00257 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2017).  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor  of the national\nsecurity.\u201d\n1 In his appeal brief, Applicant notes that he has not received a copy of the transcript but does not raise that\nomission as an appeal issue. \n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan              \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Of note, she has not challenged the Judge\u2019s finding\nthat Applicant decided to forego pursing the self-defense claim after consulting with his attorney\nin the criminal proceeding.  While Applicant testified that he shot the victim in self-defense, he\nalso acknowledged that he pled guilty to the aggravated assault offense.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAllison R. Weber, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April\n6, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August\n20, 2018, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding allegations under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  On February 8, 2019, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made findings or reached\nconclusions that were not supported by record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge was biased; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30 year old employee of a defense contractor.  He is a high school graduate,\nhas never been married, and has no children.  The SOR alleged that Applicant was cited for criminal\ndamage as a result of discharging a firearm into an unoccupied vehicle in the spring of 2012.  This\nmatter was resolved through a civil compromise in which Applicant paid for the damage and the\ncriminal case was dismissed.  Applicant admitted that alcohol played a role in that incident.  \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant was charged with attempted first degree murder and\naggravated assault for shooting an associate in the face, pushing his body out of a vehicle, and\nfleeing the scene in August 2012.  On that occasion, Applicant and the associate had been drinking\nalcohol at various locations.  Applicant had two handguns in his vehicle.  An argument ensued\nbetween Applicant and the associate.  When the associate grabbed a gun, Applicant reacted by\nshooting him in the face.  After consulting with an attorney, Applicant decided not to pursue a self-\ndefense claim.  He pled guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to three and a half years in\nprison.  He served 28 months of incarceration for felony aggravated assault and was placed on\nprobation.1  He successfully completed his probation in 2016 and has had no further involvement\nwith law enforcement.  At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was in control of his senses when\nhe shot the associate.  He has not received alcohol treatment or counseling and continues to consume\nalcohol.  \u201cThe last time he was intoxicated was at a friend\u2019s wedding about a year ago.\u201d  Decision\nat 3.  Witnessed testified that Applicant performs his duties in an outstanding manner.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n1 Since Applicant was sentenced to, and incarcerated for, more than one-year as a result of his aggravated assault\nconviction, he is disqualified under the Bond Amendment from being granted or renewed access to Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI), Special Access Programs (SAP), or Restricted Data (RD).  See, Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. B \u00b6 2.\n2\n\nBoth instances of Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct involved the abuse of alcohol.  While\nseveral years have passed since his criminal acts, it cannot reasonably be determined such conduct\nis unlikely to recur since he still consumes alcohol.  He admitted that he drank to intoxication within\nthe last year. His subsequent success at work does not overcome his callousness in shooting his\nfriend in the face and leaving him for dead.  Such conduct casts doubt on his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nDiscussion\nUnsupported Findings or Conclusions\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant \u201cadmitted\nthat he drank to intoxication within the last year.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2, citing Decision at 7.  We note\nthe Judge first found that Applicant \u201cwas intoxicated at a friend\u2019s wedding about a year ago\u201d and\nthen concluded this event occurred \u201cwithin the last year.\u201d  Decision at 3 and 7.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nraises two challenges regarding this related finding and conclusion.  She first claims the time period\nreferenced in the conclusion is not supported by record evidence.  She correctly states that Applicant\ninitially testified the wedding had \u201cprobably been over a year\u201d ago and shortly thereafter also stated,\n\u201cSo it\u2019s been well over a year[.]\u201d   Appeal Brief at 3, citing Tr. at 98.  While the Judge may have\nerred in not precisely recounting Applicant\u2019s testimony in this regard, this was a harmless error\nbecause it likely did not affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  When the wedding occurred is not noted in the record.  Consequently, the\nexact period between the wedding and the hearing is unknown.  Since Applicant used phrases such\nas \u201cprobably . . . over a year\u201d and \u201cwell over a year\u201d in describing that period, we do not view the\nJudge\u2019s challenged finding or conclusion as a significant deviation from the record evidence.  \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding and conclusion that Applicant was\nintoxicated during that wedding.  In doing so, she makes arguments about what constitutes\nintoxication.  However, in testifying about the wedding, Applicant stated, \u201cAnd over about a five-\nhour period, I\u2019d say we had about five drinks.\u201d  Tr. At 100.   He further stated, \u201cBut I was still\ncoherent enough to walk back to the hotel, go in my room.  And I don\u2019t know.  I guess I didn\u2019t think\nit was an excessive drunk kind of not in control scenario.\u201d  Id. at 100-101.  From our review of the\nrecord, the Judge\u2019s finding and conclusion that Applicant was intoxicated on that occasion was based\nupon substantial evidence or constituted a reasonable inference that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).    \n \nIn claiming the Government did not prove the SOR allegation involving the criminal damage\ncitation, Applicant\u2019s Counsel indicated \u201cthe standard for proving an allegation is the preponderance\nof the evidence[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 8 and 9.  This is incorrect.  All that is required in a security\nclearance proceeding is proof based on substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The substantial evidence standard is less than\n3\n\na preponderance of the evidence.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999).2 \nWe find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse findings regarding the criminal damage allegation.\nDue Process Issue\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge violated Applicant\u2019s due process rights by\ncreating an arbitrary standard for mitigation that contradicts existing guidelines.3  She argues that the\nJudge \u201ccited [Applicant\u2019s] lack of abstinence as a significant concern precluding a favorable result\u201d\nand applied an \u201cabstinence only\u201d requirement when Applicant was never given such a treatment\nrecommendation.  Appeal Brief at 3-4.  She further asserts that her client was not provided advance\nnotice that such a standard would be applied in the proceeding.4  Id.   We do not find these arguments\npersuasive.  First, the Judge\u2019s decision correctly quotes applicable disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions from each of the three alleged guidelines.5  Second, in referencing Applicant\u2019s continued\nuse of alcohol, including to the point of intoxication, the Judge was not applying a new adjudicative\ncondition but merely making findings and drawing conclusions based upon Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nThird, the weight given to Applicant\u2019s continued use of alcohol, including to the point of\nintoxication, was a matter within the Judge\u2019s special province.  See, Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v.\nIves Laboratories Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 (1982)(\u201cDetermining the weight and credibility of the\nevidence is the special province of the trier of fact.\u201d).  Fourth, the application of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines for or against a security clearance is not reducible to a simple formula.  In analyzing a\ncase, the Judges must be guided by common sense and with a view toward making a reasoned\ndetermination consistent with the interests of national security.   See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 17-00569\nat 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2018).  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to establish that her client was denied\nhis procedural due process rights provided in the Directive by the Judge\u2019s analysis of his lack of\nabstinence. \nBias Issue\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends the Judge was biased.  She argues that bias\nwas demonstrated through the Judge\u2019s statements in the decision (Appeal Brief at 14), in his \u201cmany\nerrors[,]\u201d and in his \u201ctoo few references to the mitigating facts provided.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 17.  As\n2 We note that Applicant\u2019s Counsel cited the correct standard on Page 1 of her brief.  \n3 In this regard, we note the Adjudicative Guidelines are illustrative, rather than exhaustive or exclusive, lists\nof conduct and circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.  12-01698 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2014).  Use of the terms\n\u201ccould . . . include\u201d in the introductory phrase for each set of disqualifying and mitigating conditions highlights that they\nare non-exclusive lists.    \n4 DOHA is not required to provide applicants with notice of the specific provisions in the Adjudicative\nGuidelines that they might be entitled to invoke in extenuation or mitigation.  The concept of due process does not\nobligate DoD to provide an applicant with a road map on how he or she can develop or present evidence that might\nextenuate or mitigate conduct or circumstances that raise security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 7-8\n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005).\n5 A Judge is not required to discuss all of the analytical factors set forth in the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-02236 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.  2, 2018).  \n4\n\nwe have stated previously, there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased,\nand a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018).  Of note, Applicant\u2019s Counsel did not raise\nthe issue of bias during the hearing.  Moreover, the Judge made various rulings in favor of Applicant\nduring the hearing.  See, e.g, Tr. at 82, 86-87, 91, and 92.  The issues raised by Applicant\u2019s Counsel\non appeal do not rise to the level that might lead a reasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s\nimpartiality.  While Applicant is no doubt dissatisfied with the Judge\u2019s decision, an adverse\nadjudication, in and of itself, is not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge was impartial. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017), citing Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d\n751, 762 (10th Cir. 2010)(\u201cAdverse rulings alone do not demonstrate judicial bias.\u201d). \nOther Appeal Issues\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge did not consider evidence presented to mitigate\nand extenuate Applicant\u2019s alleged conduct.  In making this argument, she points to evidence or facts\nregarding the alleged criminal conduct that the Judge did not discuss.  She has not, however, rebutted\nthe presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the case.  It is well-established that a\nJudge is not required to discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01616\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2009).  \nRegarding the aggravated assault conviction, Applicant\u2019s Counsel argues that Applicant \u201cwas\noperating in self-defense, but went too far when he pushed [the victim] out of the truck and onto the\nside of the  road[.]\u201d  Appeal Brief at 5.  She also argues that Applicant \u201cwas coerced into the\nshooting incident through duress/self-defense.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7.  Her arguments raising criminal\ndefenses (such as self-defense and duress) are not persuasive.  Of note, she has not challenged the\nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant decided to forego pursing the self-defense claim after consulting with\nhis attorney in the criminal proceeding.  While Applicant testified that he shot the victim in self-\ndefense,6 he also acknowledged that he pled guilty to the aggravated assault offense.7  Tr. at 62 and\n6 An Administrative Judge is not required to accept an applicant\u2019s testimony merely because it is unrebutted. \nIndeed, it would be arbitrary and capricious for a Judge to uncritically accept a witness\u2019s testimony without considering\nwhether it is plausible and consistent with other record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03554 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug.\n23, 2007).  In this case, Applicant testified:  \nSo the shooting itself was not what the issue was.  Where I made a mistake and I didn\u2019t do the right\nthing was I left [victim].  I pushed [him] out of the seat of my truck in fear.  I can\u2019t say that I know\nwhat I was thinking, but I was scared.  And I drove away.  And for that, and as far as I understand, is\nthe charge that the grand jury added for me leaving him was aggravated assault, serious physical\ninjury, was something that was wholly my fault. [Tr. at 65-66].\nLater, he testified that he believed the victim was dead when he pushed him out of the vehicle.  Tr. at 84.  It is not clear\nhow an individual could commit an aggravated assault on a person who the individual believed was dead. \n7 Government Exhibit (GE) 2 reflects that Applicant was found guilty of the felony charge of Aggravated\nAssault - Serious Physical Injury.  A police report, GE 4, reflects that the victim was shot in his left eye and the bullet\nlodged in the back of his head.  It also indicated that the police took photographs of the victim\u2019s face, hands, knees,\npelvic area, right hip area, and right arm but did not describe the severity of the non-bullet wound injuries. \n5\n\n65-66.  The doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in DOHA proceedings.8  Under that doctrine,\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel is not permitted to contend that her client did not engage in the criminal acts\nof which he was convicted.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-06937 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has not established that the Judge erred by either finding that Applicant was\nconvicted of aggravated assault or by considering all of the facts and circumstances surrounding that\ncrime.  \nAs a related matter, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge exceeded his authority by\nnot allowing Applicant to describe events surrounding the shooting.  This issue arose during the \nredirect examination of Applicant.  While Applicant was testifying about the victim yelling at him\nwhile the victim had a gun, Department Counsel objected, stating \u201c We\u2019re getting into the details of\nthe case.\u201d  The Judge responded by saying, \u201cYes, I think I\u2019ve heard enough about the gun incident. \nLet\u2019s move on.\u201d9  Tr. at 93.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel then continued to ask Applicant questions about\nmaking amends with the victim.  She continued questioning Applicant without any further objections\nor interruptions until she had no further questions.  Tr. at 101.   Although Applicant had the right to\noffer evidence in extenuation or mitigation of his felony criminal conviction,10 he was not at liberty\nto seek to relitigate the issue of his guilt of the crime for which he was convicted.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 94-1213, supra, at 4.  In this case, Applicant explained in detail his self-defense theory in\nhis SOR response, during his personal subject interview (GE 5), and during his direct examination\nat the hearing.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has not made a proffer of what testimony Applicant would have\nprovided that was not already in evidence had he been allowed to continue testifying about the\nshooting incident on redirect examination.  From our review of the record, the Judge did not commit\nharmful error in telling Applicant\u2019s Counsel to \u201cmove on\u201d at that point in the proceeding.  The Judge\napparently made this ruling in the interests of judicial economy to exclude cumulative evidence from\nthe record.11  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02207 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2015).  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief amount to a challenge to the way in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  However, a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence is not\nsufficient to establish error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nConclusion\n8 There are exceptions to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-1213 at 3-4 (App.\nBd. Jun. 7, 1996).  None of the exceptions apply in this case.  For a greater exposition of the role of collateral estoppel\nin DOHA proceedings, see ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nApril 19, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 26, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Government established that\nApplicant used marijuana and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is 40 years old, divorced, and has two children.  She has worked in the industrial\nsecurity field for the past 16 years.  She also currently serves in the Army National Guard.  She\nadmitted using marijuana while holding a security clearance from about 2014 to 2016.  She resigned\nfrom a Navy civilian security specialist position when she learned of a proposal to remove her from\nthat position due to complaints about her marijuana use.  She was well aware of the rules and\nregulation governing security clearances, including the zero-tolerance policy for drug abuse.  Her\ncurrent employer is aware of her past illegal drug use.  She attributed her drug involvement to her\ndivorce in 2014 and loss of contact with her children.  Later that year, she started another\nrelationship with an individual who had a medical marijuana card and access to marijuana oils and\nsimilar products.  This friend introduced her to marijuana to help her relax and sleep.  Applicant\nused it about five times.  The last use occurring in 2016.  When she terminated that relationship, the\nex-friend submitted an IG complaint detailing Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana oils.  Applicant no\nlonger associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs.  She has signed a statement of intent to abstain\nfrom illegal drugs.  In 2016, 2017, and 2018, she underwent drug tests that were all negative.  A\nlicenced professional evaluated her and concluded she demonstrated no evidence of an alcohol or\nsubstance use disorder.  \nApplicant willingly disregarded the law.  She made poor decisions that raise questions about\nwhether she will properly protect national secrets.  While she is remorseful for her misconduct,\ninsufficient time has passed to establish her misconduct will not be repeated.  She has not mitigated\nthe alleged security concerns.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the Government never established that she actually used marijuana.  She\nargues she used CBD oil (Cannabidiol) in which the presence of THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) was\nuncertain.  This argument is not persuasive.  In responding to the two SOR allegations, Applicant\nstated:\n2\n\nI admit that I used marijuana with a varying frequency in 2014 through at\nleast 2016.  I would like to clarify that I only swallowed the marijuana oil a total of\nfive times or less.\nI admit my use of an illegal drug as set forth in subparagraph 1.a occurred\nafter I had been granted a Department of Defense Security Clearance in November\n2012.  I am very regretful of my actions to use the marijuana oil, this was a lapse in\njudgment that is very embarrassing and out of character.  Below I have addressed the\nmitigating factors as suggested by [a DoD employee].1\nOnce Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, none of the alleged facts remained controverted and\nthe Government no longer had the burden of production.  At that point, she became responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the resulting\nsecurity concerns.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.  Furthermore, in another signed statement,\n1 Applicant\u2019s SOR Response is dated April 30, 2018.  In her appeal brief, Applicant claims she stated in her\nSOR Response and in her hearing testimony that she was unsure CBD oil contained THC.  We are unable to find that\nstatement in her SOR Response.  In discussing the mitigating conditions, her SOR Response does indicate, \u201cI had only\nknown that the CBD oil was said to not make you feel high and it was NOT a psychoactive.\u201d  Such a statement, however,\ndoes not amount to a renunciation or repudiation of her SOR admissions.  Additionally, while she testified equivocally\nabout whether she knew use of CBD oil was legal or not, she never requested that her SOR admissions be retracted.  Tr.\nat 64-66 and 84-93.  For example, she testified as follows:\n[Applicant]:   . . .  And I definitely understand that as part of our Adjudicative Guidelines, you know,\nI definitely broke a rule.  And I\u2019m very regretful for that.\n[Applicant\u2019s Counsel]: Okay, so the Statement of Reasons -- I\u2019ll go into that -- says that -- \u201cYou used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from about 2014 to 2016, all while holding a Department of\nDefense  Security Clearance.\u201d  Is that accurate?\n[Applicant]: Yes.\n[Applicant\u2019s Counsel]:  Okay.  Now, was it -- how did you use the marijuana?  Was it smoking or was\nit edibles?  What was it?\n[Applicant]: It was through the cannabis oils -- CBD oils -- cannabis oil.  I was, honestly, at that time,\nunsure whether it was illegal or not.  And it\u2019s been a weird phase where it\u2019s legal or not legal.  I see\nit sold over the counter in different kinds of health and holistic foods.  I was honestly unsure.  It still\ndoes not take away from it being a mistake.  But is was through the oil form.  [Tr. at 65.] \nApplicant also testified: \n[Department Counsel]: Okay.  Is it -- is it the truth that the only time, in your belief that you used what\nyou believe to be a controlled substance, was in the form of CBD oil?\n[Applicant]: Yes.  [Tr. at 83.] \n3\n\nApplicant admitted she knowingly used another individual\u2019s medical marijuana.2  From our review\nof the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings about Applicant\u2019s marijuana use were based upon\nsubstantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).       \nApplicant also contends that the Judge applied an erroneous standard.  She argues the Judge\napplied a higher standard to Applicant than other individuals when she stated: \u201cAs a security\nspecialist, Applicant is not only required to follow all security rules and regulations, but is required\nto ensure that other employees are equally asdiligent.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 11-12, citing from Decision\nat 6.  This argument lacks merit because it is based on an incorrect premise.  The quoted sentence\nwas not used by the Judge as a \u201cstandard\u201d for determining Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility,3\ninstead it was merely a conclusion she reached based upon the record evidence.  Under the\nadjudicative guidelines, a Judge is tasked to consider, among other matters, \u201cthe nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct\u201d and \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation.\u201d   Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(d)(1) and (2).  Applicant\u2019s security\nspecialist position and her security responsibilities were appropriate factors for the Judge to consider\nin determining her security clearance eligibility in that they bear upon her knowledge of the security\nsignificance of her conduct.         \nApplicant further contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed the\nevidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  In her\narguments, she emphasizes, for example, the amount of time that has passed since her last alleged\ndrug use, her ceasing to associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs, and her submission of a letter\nof intent with automatic revocation of her security clearance for any further illegal drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments, however, are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence\nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488\nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  We give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that\nApplicant has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to\nundermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.  Additionally, the Judge complied with the requirements of the\n2 In Government Exhibit 4, Applicant stated:\nWith these medical issues such as back pain, [Applicant\u2019s friend] was approved for a medical\nmarijuana card.  [The friend] began to use her prescriptions on a regular basis.  Her prescriptions\nconsisted of marijuana in the plant form, and in the form of an oil.  I did not completely understand\nthe contents in the oil or the ratio of THC in it.  The only thing I knew about was that it was also said\nto help with anxiety.  I was not sleeping at night, and having serious anxiety.  . . .  I have never been\nexposed to marijuana before in this manner except while I was with [the friend].  Between the years\nof 2014 and 2016 I tried the medical marijuana that [the friend] had approximately five times.   \n3 The Decision reflects the Judge correctly applied the \u201cclearly consistent with national interest\u201d standard to\ndetermine Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  See, Directive \u00b6 2.3 and Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(c) as well as Decision\nat 7. \n4\n\nDirective in her whole-person analysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching her\ndecision. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  An applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs while knowing such conduct was incompatible with\nsecurity clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment and reliability.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-03460 at4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018).  The decision is sustainable on this record. \n\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the\ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is 30 years old, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010.  After college, he\nexperienced periods of unemployment and underemployment.  In 2016, he began working for a\ndefense contractor.  The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent student loans with\nbalances that total over $65,000.  He admitted seven of those allegations.  In responding to the SOR,\nhe noted that he took a \u201chiatus\u201d in his efforts to pay his debts when his wife was pursuing a graduate\ndegree.  Applicant provided documentation showing he made some payments on the student loans. \nIn this regard, the Judge found:\nWithout a more detailed explanation from Applicant, I can only conclude that his\nevidence is intended to show that he has made payments on two or possibly more of\nhis student loan debts, whether alleged in the SOR or not.

Upon graduating from college, he failed to develop a repayment plan.  These\ncircumstances were within his control, and he failed to act responsibly in addressing them.\n1 Decision at 3.  \n2 Decision at 3-4.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nIn his brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s rulings or findings of fact.  He\nchallenges the Judge\u2019s application of Mitigating Conditions 20(a)3 and 20(c).4  He contends that he\nprovided payment receipts for his \u201cthen active\u201d debt accounts, but acknowledged that the account\nnumbers do not directly match those in the SOR because the debts have been passed through\ncollection agencies.  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also argues that he resumed making payments towards\nthe debts when his wife completed her graduate degree in 2018.  His arguments amount to a\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  As we stated in the past, the presence of\nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  The Judge, as the trier of fact, has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).  Moreover, even if an applicant has actually paid his debts or is making\npayments on them, a Judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debts for what they\nmay reveal about the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02394 at\n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015).  \n \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.

He submitted a number of character letters recommending his security clearance be\nreinstated, but it is not clear whether all of the authors are aware of his alleged conduct.  He has\nexpressed embarrassment and remorse over this conduct.  He has no intention of repeating this\nbehavior.\n \u201c[H]is sexual misbehavior causes him to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress,\nand demonstrated a lack of good judgment.\u201d  Decision at 5.  His most recent hiring of prostitutes\noccurred about two years ago.  His more recent incidents cast doubt on his good judgment.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant states the facts set forth in the decision are true, but notes that there was a minor\nerror concerning one of his son\u2019s age and that he notified his employer about his conduct soon after\ntaking the polygraph in 2016 as opposed to after receiving the SOR.  Most of Applicant\u2019s arguments\namount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are insufficient to show\nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  Furthermore, we need not agree\n2\n\nwith a Judge\u2019s decision in order to find it sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13965 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 6, 2013). \nApplicant notes that he has been denied access to classified information since shortly after\ntaking the polygraph and asks whether that succeeding period could \u201ccount for some penance.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 4.  The Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse or remand a Judge\u2019s decision is limited\nto circumstances in which the Judge erred and correction of the identified error mandates such\nactions.   Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.33.2 and 3.  Applicant also asks if there is \u201ca time frame that would\nconstitute enough time has passed where I could reapply.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 4.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.3.37-\n41 address reapplications.  Paragraph E3.1.37 states, \u201c[a]n applicant whose security clearance has\nbeen finally denied or revoked by DOHA is barred from reapplication for 1 year from the date of\nthe initial unfavorable clearance decision.\u201d \nApplicant notes that the Judge relied, in part, on a government policy of combating\ntrafficking in persons (CTIP).  He asserts he was not aware of the policy until his security clearance\nwas being adjudicated.  The Judge made findings about Applicant\u2019s lack of knowledge of the\npolicy.1  Reading the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, we conclude that, even if she erred in concluding\nApplicant violated the CTIP policy, she would have reached the same ultimate conclusion without\nconsidering the policy.   \n \nThe Judge\u2019s  decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance\nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\n2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\n1 The CTIP policy applies to contractors through regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation\n(FAR).  48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.222.50, Combating Trafficking in Persons, (as amended) and 48 C.F.R.

Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On December 20, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 35 years old, served in the military, and received an honorable discharge. \nHe has earned an associate\u2019s degree.  He has been married twice and has five children.  He was\nemployed from September 2015 to  May 2017, when he was laid off.  He remained unemployed until\nhe began working at a car dealership on a commission basis in August 2017.  He was also self-\nemployed as a financial advisor since May 2017.  He attributes his financial problems to his recent\nunemployment.\nApplicant has ten delinquent debts totaling about $32,000.  His admissions and a credit\nreport establish the SOR allegations.  He noted that his previously payments towards his debts\nshowed he was financially responsible.  However, upon being released from a management position,\nhe was unable to make minimum payments towards his debts due to insufficient income.  He only\nhad $73 a month for payments on his delinquent debts, but expected that amount to increase in the\nfollowing years and that he would have them paid by early 2025.  He did not provide evidence that\nhe has made any payments.  The IRS applied a portion of his tax refund to a  delinquent child\nsupport debt.  He and his wife do not recognize one debt; however, he did not provide evidence of\nany action to dispute it. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and ongoing.  His unemployment was a condition\nbeyond his control.  He did not provide any proof of financial counseling or of voluntary payments\ntowards his delinquent debts.  His child support debt was satisfied though an involuntary tax\nwithholding.  Although he has a plan to resolve his delinquent debts, he has not implemented it.  He\ndid not provide evidence of contacting creditors to make payment arrangements.  He has not met his\nburden of persuasion. \n   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. \n \n2\n\nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not properly weigh and consider all of the record\nevidence.  For example, he highlights his job loss, his prior history of financial responsibility, and\nhis plan for repayment of the debts.  The Judge, however, made findings about those matters and\ndiscussed them in either her mitigation or whole-person analysis.  Applicant\u2019s arguments are neither\nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor\nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.

On July\n6, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision\n\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On March 5, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is 30 years old and unmarried.  He served in the military and was granted a security\nclearance in 2006.   Following his military discharge in 2012, he was unemployed for about a year\nbefore attending college.  For portions of 2015 and 2016, he worked overseas.  For portions of 2016\nand 2017, he was unemployed as a full-time student.  He has not yet earned a degree.  In 2017, he\nbegan working for a defense contractor. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file timely his Federal tax returns for 2014-2016\nand that he had four delinquent debts totaling over $19,000.  He filed his 2014 Federal tax return in\nApril 2016.  He paid one of the alleged debts in 2016 and has repayment plans in place for two other\ndebts.  In August 2018, he filed his Federal tax returns for 2015-2017.  He thought that he could not\nfile his 2015-2017 Federal tax returns until he paid a $1,000 debt owed to a former employer.  After\nconsulting with a tax preparer, he was advised the delinquent tax returns could be filed without first\npaying the debt.   \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on three alleged debts and against him on the Federal\ntax-filing allegation and a $328 debt owed to the U.S. Government.  His Federal tax returns for 2015\nand 2016 were not filed until after he received the SOR.  \u201cEven where tax problems have been\ncorrected and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems in the future, the administrative\njudge is not precluded from considering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior\nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d  Decision at 10, citing ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 18, 2015).  Applicant has yet to show a track record of complying with tax-filing deadlines. \nThe Judge also noted that Applicant disputes the $328 U.S. Government debt due to his lack of\nknowledge about it, but he submitted no documentation establishing it is not his responsibility. \nFurthermore, he has not shown any effort to investigate that debt, which is on his credit report.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence and did not\nproperly apply the facts of the case to the mitigating conditions.  He argues, for example, that the\nJudge disregarded evidence that shows he filed all of his tax returns and hired a tax professional to\nresolve other outstanding issues.  He further claims the Judge erred by failing \u201cto realize the steps\n2\n\n[he] has taken to remedy his past tax issues\u201d and erred by not concluding Mitigating Condition 20(g)\nwas fully applicable.1  Appeal Brief at 9-10.   Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are neither sufficient\nto rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019).  We give due consideration\nto the Hearing Office case that Applicant has cited in support of his arguments, but it is neither\nbinding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.  The\nJudge discussed Mitigating Condition 20(g) and noted Applicant still has tax debt and failed to\ndisclose his tax situation on his security clearance application.  She also considered applicable case\nlaw.  There is no reason to disturb her analysis under 20(g).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax\nreturns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required\nof those granted access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd.\nApr. 5, 2017).   The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance\nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAustin J. Lewis, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n21, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 3, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeal (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nAs amended, the SOR listed ten Guideline F allegations.  The Judge found against Applicant\non five of those allegations.  Of those five allegations, Applicant denied a 2015 tax filing deficiency\nallegation; admitted three of the delinquent debts, including a large Federal tax debt; and was unsure\nof a fourth debt that was past-due for about $290.  The Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant has known that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sought additional taxes\nfrom him for tax years 2009 and 2010 since 2013, and his tax debt remains\nunresolved.  He did not timely file his federal income tax return for 2015.  He has\nthree other unresolved delinquent debts.  He did not establish that he was unable to\nmake greater progress resolving his delinquent debts.  Financial considerations\nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  Eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied. [Decision at 1.]\nIn 2018, an IRS issued a letter stating that Applicant\u2019s Federal tax debt totaled about $85,000 and\nhis income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2017 had not been received.  The Judge noted that\nApplicant stated he was unwilling to settle with the IRS because that agency keep changing the\namount owed and had not acted in good faith.  However, he believed he was making progress to\nresolve his Federal tax debt because he recently requested the appointment of an IRS tax advocate\nfrom whom he wants to obtain a settlement amount and then negotiate an offer in compromise.\nApplicant\u2019s 2015 Federal Income Tax Return\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred in concluding that he failed to file his\n2015 Federal tax return in a timely manner.  He asserts the record evidence established that he timely\nfiled his 2015 Federal income tax return but the IRS failed to process that return \u201cfor some time.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 5.  \nIn the decision, the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s alleged tax filing deficiency by stating:\nApplicant said he timely filed the tax returns, and he had copies of them. (Tr. 36-37) \nI asked Applicant to provide copies of the tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2015 [sic].\n2\n\n(Tr. 65)  He said he was going to ask his accountant when she submitted those tax\nreturns.  (Tr. 65)  He sent a registered mail receipt showing something was submitted\nto the IRS on April 15, 2015, and said this was his 2014 federal income tax return. \n(Tr. 66, 73; AE A at 2)  I have credited Applicant with timely filing his federal\nincome tax return for tax year 2014.  He said he was unaware that the IRS had not\nreceived his tax returns until 2018 when he received the IRS information at his\nbankruptcy.  (Tr. 37)  He said he \u201creproduced\u201d the tax returns and received the\nrefunds. (Tr 37). [Decision at 4.]\nIn his analysis, the Judge stated that, without a statement from an accountant or an email showing\nwhen Applicant\u2019s 2015 Federal income tax return was filed or sent to the IRS, he declined to credit\nhim with filing that return in a timely manner.  We note that Applicant\u2019s appeal brief fails to identify \nany documentary evidence of record that supports his claim that his 2015 Federal income tax return\nwas submitted on or before its due date.  As the Appeal Board has previously noted, it is reasonable\nfor a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation showing their financial problems have\nbeen resolved or are being resolved.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30,\n2008).  From our review of the record, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\nfailed to file his 2015 Federal income tax return in a timely manner.  Furthermore, Applicant says\n\u201cApplicant\u2019s federal tax return for tax year 2015 was in fact timely filed and evidence of such, that\nwould have been sufficient for AJ, can be provided upon reviewed opportunity to do so.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 5.  However, the Board has no authority to remand a case for the taking in of new evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-10934 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.21, 2016).\nApplicant\u2019s Delinquent Debts\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he acted responsibly in addressing his delinquent\ndebts.  He notes, for example, that his delinquent Federal tax debt initially arose when a surprising\nshift occurred in his employment status (i.e., the IRS determined he was not an independent\ncontractor (1099 filer) but rather an employee (W-2 filer)); that his ex-wife\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility contributed to his problems; that he consulted with an accountant and two bankruptcy\nattorneys to determine the best course of action to pursue; that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and\nutilized financial counseling to control his financial situation; that some of his debts were charged\noff during the bankruptcy; that he withdrew from the bankruptcy after the IRS keep changing the\namount due; and that, even thought he withdrew from the bankruptcy, he continued to adhere to its\nterms by setting aside $714 per month to apply toward his creditors.  Regarding the non-tax debts,\nhe also asserts he contacted creditors in an attempt to settle the accounts after the bankruptcy,\nresolved some accounts, and established a payment plan for another.  He argues his efforts were\nsufficient to mitigate the alleged debts.   \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are not persuasive.  In the decision, the Judge addressed the matters\nthat Applicant is raising on appeal.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s change in employment\nstatus and his ex-wife\u2019s financial irresponsibility were conditions beyond his control that adversely\naffected his finances but he failed to establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  The\nJudge also concluded that Applicant did not establish:  that his financial problems were under\n3\n\ncontrol, that he was unable to better address his delinquent taxes and other debts, that he diligently\nattempted to set up payment plans to address his three non-tax debts or his taxes that he learned were\npast-due in 2013, and that he did not provide proof of a track record of payments on his delinquent\ndebts.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding the delinquent debts are\nsustainable.  Applicant\u2019s arguments, in essence, amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence and are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan.\n8, 2016). \nConclusion\nApplicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s decision.  The Judge examined\nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is\nsustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n6, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  At the hearing, the SOR was purportedly amended by\nadding a Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) allegation.  Tr. at 71-74 and 85-87. \nOn July 19, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in considering the\nevidence of drug involvement; whether the Judge was biased; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we remand.\nThe SOR alleged, as amended, that Applicant had nine delinquent debts totaling about\n$43,000, that he had three alcohol-related driving arrests between 2015 and 2018, and that he used\na drug, Xanax, that was not prescribed to him while holding a security clearance.   The Judge found\nin favor of Applicant on four of the debts totaling about $4,200 and against him on the remaining\nallegations.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion under Guideline H, which was not part\nof the SOR prior to the hearing.  For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Applicant was\nnot provided the due process the Directive affords in amending the SOR.   \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel questioned Applicant about a Xanax pill that was found\non his person during the 2018 arrest.  Applicant testified that he used Xanax about three or four times\nwithout a prescription while holding a security clearance.  He also stated the he obtained the pill\nfrom a friend to help him sleep.  Tr. 71-74.  At the end of Applicant\u2019s testimony, the following\nexchange occurred:\n[Judge]: I don\u2019t have any other questions.  Do you have any other questions,\nDepartment Counsel?\n[Department Counsel]:  I don\u2019t, Your Honor, but I\u2019m going to list one on the SOR.\n[Judge]:  Okay.\n[Department Counsel]:  So, this would be, yeah, be a new paragraph under Guideline\nH.\n[Judge]:  Okay.\n[Department Counsel]:  And I would propose that you don\u2019t use Xanax, which was\nnot prescribed to you while holding a secret security clearance.\n2\n\n[Judge]:  Okay, so do you understand what she just did?  The evidence shows, and\nyour testimony also supports that I did use Xanax; maybe not a lot, but it\u2019s a\nprescription pill that was not prescribed to you, which is a no-no.  And you held a\nDoD security clearance at the time.\nSo, again, that\u2019s a concerning to the Government.  You know, you\u2019re telling\nme your trustworthy, you reliable, but it\u2019s instances like this where the Government\nsays wow, you know, this person was doing this, and they know it\u2019s wrong.  They\nknow they shouldn\u2019t be doing this.  You have annual training, don\u2019t you, as a security\nclearance holder?\n[Applicant]:  Yes.  I was doing, I, like I say, it\u2019s not a regular occurrence.  And I\ndidn\u2019t really think about that not being a prescription drug.  And I know that it\u2019s for\npain and help you sleep.  I didn\u2019t, but I know --  \n[Judge]:  It\u2019s for anxiety.\n[Applicant]:  -- with the high on opioid crisis now, I know that, I think that\u2019s\nconsidered an opioid.\n[Judge]:  No, it\u2019s not   It\u2019s a benzodiazepine, or whatever that is.\n[Applicant]:  Okay.\n[Judge]:  It is not an opioid.  I do know that.\n[Applicant]:  Okay.\n[Judge]:  But Xanax, I mean, if you get it from a friend, you don\u2019t know where that\ncame from.  It could have been bought off the street.  And you know they\u2019re mixing\nfentanyl.  Have you heard about that crisis; they\u2019re mixing fentanyl with drugs now.\n[Applicant]:  Yes.\n[Judge]:  So, you take your life in your hands when you take something that\u2019s not\nprescribed to you from a pharmacy.  If you just take a drug, you don\u2019t know what\nyou\u2019re ingesting.  I would give, that\u2019s very concerning, okay?  And I\u2019m just\ncautioning you because I\u2019ve experienced that, personally, and don\u2019t wish that on\nanyone, okay?\n[Applicant]:   Yes.\n[Judge]:   I had a family member pass away from taking Xanax that had fentanyl. \nAnd there\u2019s an ongoing criminal investigation going right now.  So, please be careful. \nPlease make better choices in your life, okay?\n3\n\n[Applicant]:  Okay. \n[Judge]:  You\u2019re a father.  You have kids.  You should know better.\n[Applicant]:  I do.  \n[Judge]:  Okay, I\u2019m not going to preach anymore, but there is a crisis going on with\ndrugs in our society, and it\u2019s out of control.\n[Applicant]:  Yes.\n[Judge]:  All right, so do you want to call your next witness? [Tr. at 85-87.]\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.17 provides:\nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his or her\nown motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render\nit in conformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause.  When such\namendments are made, the Administrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s request for\nsuch additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate for further\npreparation or other good cause.\nCompare that paragraph with \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.3 and E3.1.4, which provide that \u201ca written SOR . . . shall be\nas detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits\u201d and that an applicant has 20 days\nfrom receipt of the SOR to respond to it.1  As we have previously stated, an applicant is entitled to\nreceive reasonable notice of the allegations being made against him so that he or she can have a\nmeaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App.\nBd. Mar. 15, 2004). \nIn this case, the record reflects that Applicant was not informed adequately at the hearing\nabout the process for amending the SOR, was not explicitly informed the SOR was being amended,\nwas not informed of the exact wording of the SOR amendment, was not asked whether he admitted\nor denied the amendment, was not asked whether he would like additional time to respond to the\namendment, and was not advised he could submit additional matters pertaining to the amendment\nwhile the record remained open for a month following the hearing.  After the above-quoted\nexchange, Applicant was never asked at the hearing if he had any additional testimony or evidence\nto present on the Xanax allegation.2  The wording of the SOR amendment is not reflected in the\ntranscript.  The amendment is handwritten on the SOR and contains what amounts to two marginal\ninsertions.  From our review of the handwritten amendment, we are unable to determine with\ncertainty its exact wording; specifically, it is unclear where one of the insertions is to be incorporated\n1 An applicant is also provided at least 15 days from receipt of the Notice of Hearing to prepare for the hearing.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. \n \n2 After the witness mentioned in the last sentence of the above-quoted exchange testified, Applicant was not\nasked whether he had any additional evidence to present or whether he rested his case.  At that point, the proceeding\nmoved directly to closing statements.  Tr. at 94.\n4\n\nin the allegation.  There is no indication in the record that Applicant was ever provided or shown the\nhandwritten amendment.  The Decision reflects that the Judge \u201cgranted the amendment without\nobjection.\u201d  Decision at 2.  The amendment, however, was not presented at the hearing as a motion\nto amend the SOR as provided in \u00b6 E3.1.17.  The transcript neither reflects that the Judge \u201cgranted\nthe amendment\u201d or a motion to amend the SOR nor does it indicate that Applicant was ever asked\nif he had any objection to the amendment.  Finally, the version of the amendment reflected in the\nJudge\u2019s Decision does not exactly match the handwritten amendment.  Given these deficiencies, we\nconclude that Applicant was not provided adequate notice of the SOR amendment nor was he given\nan adequate opportunity to respond to it.  We conclude the case should be remanded to correct these\ndue process deficiencies.  \nApplicant also contends that \u201c[t]he Judge did wrong interjecting that she lost a family\nmember to Xanax or drug issues and how the pill was mixed with fentanyl which killed a family\nmember making my case personal to her which shows bias.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2.  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that\npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-09607 at 4\n(App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2011).  The standard is not whether the appealing party personally believes that\nthe Judge was biased, but whether the record of the proceeding contains any indication that the Judge\nacted in a manner that would lead a disinterested person to question the fairness of the Judge.  Id. \nWhile the Judge\u2019s comments about her family member passing away from Xanax were apparently\nintended to assist Applicant, they were inappropriate.  Judges should refrain from interjecting their\npersonal affairs into the proceedings and refrain from providing applicants with unsolicited personal\nadvice or opinions.  Id at 3-4. Here, given the Judge\u2019s injudicious comments that could reasonably\ncause a disinterested person to question her impartiality on the drug allegation, we conclude the best\ncourse of action is to remand the case to another Judge for a new hearing.    \nWe also note that the Decision reflects that Applicant submitted three post-hearing exhibits\nthat were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N-P.  We are unable to find those exhibits in the record. \nOn remand, the new Judge should ensure that the missing exhibits are located or replaced.\nApplicant has asserted additional errors.  Because of the Board\u2019s disposition of the  issues\ndiscussed above, it is unnecessary for the Board to address the remaining appeal issues.\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is remanded with the recommendation that the case be assigned to another\nJudge for a new hearing and proceedings consistent with the Directive.\nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan        \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 28, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in his mid-30s, has worked for a defense contractor for over the past four years. \nStarting in 1999, he was hospitalized multiple times for suicidal ideation and manic behavior.  He\ncontends that his parents forced him into the hospital against his will, which caused him emotional\ndistress.  In the mid-2000s, he was treated for Bipolar Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and\nSevere Psychotic Tendencies.  Soon thereafter, he stopped all medications and counseling and sought\n\u201calternative treatments.\u201d  Decision at 3-4.  In 2010, he was contemplating suicide and sought\nassistance.  He was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder; Psychotic Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified;\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder; Social Phobia; Alcohol Dependence; Cannabis Dependence; and\nPolysubstance Dependence.\nIn late 2017, DoD requested a psychological evaluation of Applicant.  The psychologist\ndetermined that Applicant met the criteria for Bipolar Disorder, most recent episode depression, in\npartial remission; Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, in remission; Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild; and\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (with associated panic attacks).  The psychologist noted Applicant was\nevasive in reporting his past use of alcohol and marijuana.  Applicant\u2019s treatment records noted a\nhistory of paranoia, visual hallucinations, and delusional and disorganized thinking.  The\npsychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s mental health status appears to negatively impact his\njudgment and trustworthiness and, if his mental health symptoms were to reemerge, his stability and\nreliability would also be negatively impacted.  He has not received professional treatment or\nprescribed medications for his diagnosed mental health conditions since about 2011.  None of the\nmitigating conditions fully apply to the Guideline I allegations.\nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant had defaulted on four student loans totaling about\n$23,000 and had five other delinquent debts totaling about $3,000.  Applicant attributed his financial\nproblems to being a single parent, medical expenses arising from a back injury, and the absence of\nfinancial aid during his last semester of college.  He made a few payments on the student loans, but\nadmitted he has not recently made any payment toward them.  The alleged debts remain unresolved. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to the Guideline F allegations.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is flawed.  He argues that his brief periods of\ninstability were due to extenuating circumstances beyond his control, that his guardians forced him\n2\n\ninto psychiatric treatment against his will, and that, since his last hospitalization about 15 years ago,\nhe has proven his stability and his ability to make intuitive and reasonable decisions.  He contends\nthat he terminated his treatment because he no longer needed it and that he is being discriminated\nagainst because of his previous psychiatric history.  He further argues that it is a mistake to use his\nstudent loans as a reason for denying his security clearance because he is not the only employee of\na defense contractor with such debt.  We do not find his arguments persuasive.\nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact.  His arguments\namount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in an manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).  His argument that other defense\ncontractor employees have delinquent student loans warrants no remedial action because each\nsecurity clearance adjudication must be judged on its own merits.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn short, Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On November 30, 2018, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nRobert J. Kilmartin denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant admitted all of the delinquent debts in the SOR and two bankruptcy discharges. \nShe experienced a period of unemployment in 2014 after being laid off from her job.  She provided\na chart reflecting that certain debts were in a payment plan, but provided no proof of those payments.\nShe enrolled other identified debts in a debt relief program, but provided no evidence of a\ncontinuous stream of payments under that program because it was just recently established.  She\nprovided documentary evidence of payments towards some debts, had a debt cancelled, and settled\na debt. \nApplicant has done little to resolve her financial problems.  She failed to provide sufficient\ndocumentation to mitigate the security concerns arising from the alleged debts.  She has not meet\nher burden of showing that she acted responsibly under the circumstances, that her financial\nproblems are under control, or that those problems are unlikely to recur.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes extensive explanations and documentation that are not contained\nin the record.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not properly weigh and consider all of the relevant \nevidence.  For example, she argues that the Judge \u201cappears to have used [a more recent credit report]\nto identify new debts not captured in [an earlier] credit report, but not highlight debts that no longer\nappear on my credit report or that I am no longer financially responsible due to the age or validity\nof the accounts.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  However, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit\nreport does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2018).  Debts may fall off credit reports\nfor various reasons, including the passage of time.  Id.

On May\n21, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On January 15, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Gregg A. Cervi denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 49 years old, has been employed by a government contractor since 2016.\nShe retired from the Air National Guard in 2008 and has held various security clearances.  She has\nbeen convicted of either driving while intoxicated or operating a vehicle under the influence of\nalcohol on four occasions.  These offenses occurred in 1995, 2007, 2016, and 2017.  After her 2007\narrest, she was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser and attended follow-up treatment.  The 2016 and\n2017 incidents involved traffic accidents.  During the 2016 incident, she lost control of her vehicle\nand hit a pole; a breathalyzer revealed her blood alcohol content was .334 %.  She participated in\nalcohol treatment programs following the last two incidents.  She provided a recent letter from a\ntherapist stating she no longer drinks alcohol and resolved personal issues satisfactorily.  The\ntherapist indicated she is doing extremely well and is not a threat to national security.   \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol use and driving while impaired.  She has not\nprovided sufficient evidence of abstinence or the ability to drink responsibly.  The record is devoid\nof details about her treatment and evidence establishing a change in behavior.  She has had lapses\nfollowing treatment.  The Judge was not convinced Applicant\u2019s claimed abstinence was credible or\nwould be sustained.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends her security investigation was not complete and thorough.1  She indicates\nthat she assumed the investigation was thorough and supplied to the Judge.  She requests that she\nbe provided with all documentation that was presented to the Judge.  The record, however, reflects\nthat she was previously provided with that documentation.  On July 19, 2018, Department Counsel\nmailed to Applicant the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  The FORM notified her: \u201cIf you do not\nfile any objections or submit any additional information within 30 days of receipt of this letter, your\ncase will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely on this FORM.\u201d\n[Emphasis added.]  FORM at 3.  In responding to the FORM, Applicant submitted a letter from her\nto the Judge.  The Judge\u2019s decision was based on the FORM and Applicant\u2019s response to it.  After\nhaving admitted the SOR allegations, the burden was on Applicant to mitigate those security\n1 The Appeal Board has no authority to rule on the sufficiency of a security clearance investigation.

If she wanted the Judge to consider matters that were not in the\nFORM, it was her responsibility to present such matters to him.    \nApplicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s decision.  She makes \narguments about her alcohol treatment that are based incorrectly on her assumption that those\nmatters were before the Judge for consideration.  She does correctly note that the Judge erred in\nfinding she was arrested in October 2017, instead of May 2017; however, this error was harmless\nbecause it likely had no affect on the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15084 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  Applicant also requests \u201cmore time to acquire the necessary\ndocumentation to complete the Appeal.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  The Board has no authority to grant an\napplicant a continuance in order to develop additional favorable evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-00151 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 12, 2014).  Moreover, the Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \n  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

His taxes remained unpaid despite\nhaving a residuary monthly income of several thousand dollars.  \nApplicant\u2019s tax transcripts reflected a continuous stream of payments to the IRS for only a\nfinite period.  It is unclear why his 2009 and 2010 delinquencies have not been satisfied.  The record\nindicates he chose to pay for automobiles and his children\u2019s education ahead of his taxes.   He\nrepeatedly demonstrated bad judgment.  There is insufficient evidence to conclude his financial\nproblems are under control.\nDiscussion    \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant challenges the SOR allegations as well as various findings and\nconclusions in the Judge\u2019s decision.  In doing so, Applicant makes assertions in his brief that are not\nsupported by the record evidence.  For example, he contends that he owes only $439 in past due\ntaxes plus interest and penalties for 2009.  However, the most recent IRS tax document in the record\ndoes not support that contention.  As of August 2018, his 2009 tax transcript reflected that he owed\nthe IRS a balance of about $7,034 ($3,555 in past due taxes, $2,067 in interest, and $1,411 in\npenalties).  Applicant\u2019s Response to File of Relevant Material.  Additionally, his appeal brief states\nthat he mailed a payment to the U.S. Treasury of $14,000 on \u201c23 January\u201d (presumably, 2019) for\nall his past-due taxes, but there is no evidence reflecting that payment in the record.  His\nunsupported assertions constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions are based\non substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).\nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  Applicant argues, for example, that his tax deficiencies are being resolved\nthrough a repayment agreement.  A Judge should consider not only the extent to which an\napplicant\u2019s delinquent taxes have been resolved or are being resolved, but also the circumstances\nunderlying those debts that reflect negatively on his or her judgment and reliability.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 14-03392 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2015).  In this case, Applicant has longstanding Federal\ntax delinquencies that remain unresolved even though he has substantial income.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments are not sufficient to show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \n  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  A person\nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as failing to pay taxes when due, does\nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access\nto classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 24, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision \u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn March 6, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 62 years old, has been working for her current employer since 2016.  Over\nthe past 20 years, she held security clearances while working for other employers.  She is married\nwith two minor children and an adult step-son. \n The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file timely her 2008-2009 and 2011-2015 Federal\nincome tax returns; had delinquent Federal taxes totaling over $300,000 for 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012,\n2014, and 2015; had a second mortgage past-due for about $24,100; had a credit card account past-\ndue for $4,000;  had a line of credit past-due for about $2,100; had two Federal tax liens totaling over\n$120,000; had a collection account over $25,900; and had two other delinquent debts totaling less\nthan $1,000.  She encountered financial problems when her husband, who was earning about\n$150,000 annually, became unemployed in 2008.  She is now the sole source of income for the\nfamily and has an annual income of about $191,000.  She indicated that they are unable to pay their\ncurrent debts on her income.  Her household operates with a negative monthly balance of about\n$5,600.  At the time of the hearing, her husband had received an offer for a job with an annual  salary\nof about $154,000. \nApplicant has filed the delinquent tax returns.  During most of those years, she operated a\nbusiness that ran into tax problems due to inadequate record keeping and reliance on her husband\nto file the tax returns.  She discovered the tax issues around the time she submitted her security\nclearance application in 2016.  She admits she owes Federal taxes, but disputes the amount.  In 2016,\nshe and her husband hired a tax attorney to help file their tax returns and negotiate a settlement with\nthe IRS.  About a month before the hearing, they were unsuccessful in their efforts to contact the\nattorney.  They hired a tax relief company about two weeks before the hearing.  The tax relief\ncompany will soon negotiate a settlement agreement with the IRS.  She intends to pay her Federal\ntax debt.  \nApplicant claimed the past-due second mortgage, the credit card account, and the line of\ncredit were combined into one loan that she is making payments towards and is now current.  She\npaid the two smallest debts and does not recall the Federal tax liens.  The $25,900 collection account\nwas entered on her credit report in error and has been removed.  She is taking a more active role in\n2\n\nthe family finances.  She plans to begin resolving her debts when her husband becomes employed\nagain.  She has received accolades for her excellent job performance.    \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing.  Although she has filed her delinquent tax\nreturns, a significant Federal tax debt remains.  She and her husband recently hired a tax firm to help\nwith disputing the amount of the Federal tax debt and in instituting a repayment plan, but the status\nof that debt is uncertain.  Given her current financial situation, the tax debt is not likely to be\nresolved in the near future.  Her husband\u2019s unemployment does not explain her former tax filing\ndelinquencies.  She has not established that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.  She is\njust beginning to deal with her Federal tax debt and other financial problems .  The Judge found in\nfavor of Applicant on the two paid debts, two Federal tax liens, and collection account that was listed\nin error on her credit report.  The Judge found against her on the remaining SOR allegations.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence and did not\nproperly apply the facts of the case to the mitigating conditions.  In doing so, she highlights such\nmatters as the circumstances beyond her control that contributed to her financial problems and her\nefforts to resolve those problems, including her hiring of a tax firm to establish an IRS payment plan. \nThe Judge, however, addressed many of those matters in her decision.  Applicant\u2019s arguments are\nneither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record\nnor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019).  We give due\nconsideration to the Hearing Office case that Applicant has cited in support of her arguments, but\nit is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. \nId. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On January 4, 2019, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Kilmartin denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant served in the military in Iraq, was honorably discharged from active duty, and\ncontinues to serve in the Reserves.  He has experienced periods of unemployment from 2009 to\n2016.  He has worked for a Federal contractor since 2016.  \nIn his 2017 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he was arrested\nfor misapplying entrusted Federal property in 2015.  The following year he pled guilty to that\nmisdemeanor offense and paid a fine.  He admitted that, while employed as a letter carrier for the\nU.S. Postal Service, he improperly dumped flyers and newsletters in a dumpster. He resigned from\nthat job under adverse circumstances.  \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegation that he had a child support arrearage of approximately\n$36,500.  His child support payments had been sporadic due to chronic unemployment.  Starting in\n2006, his pay was garnished for the arrearage.  He provided a one-page payment history reflecting\npayments every two weeks of $425 in 2017 and $506 in 2018.  His last reported payment was made\nduring the month he responded to the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  He also admitted the SOR\nallegation that he had a automobile loan past-due for about $570, with a balance of about $7,100. \nHe gave the vehicle to a friend who agreed to take over the payments.  The friend reneged on the\ndeal.  Applicant provided a letter from the auto-loan creditor reflecting he verbally authorized a\npayment of $291 in 2018.  He was supposed to continue making monthly payments on that loan, but\nprovided no documentation of further payments.  He provided character letters attesting to his\nintegrity and trustworthiness. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on a small debt that he denied and against him on the\nremaining SOR allegations. He had a fiduciary responsibility to deliver the mail.  Insufficient time\nhas passed from his misdemeanor mail-handling offense to conclude further misconduct will not\nlikely happen again.  He bears responsibility for his forced resignation due to his misconduct.  He\nmade only sporadic child support payments before a court order. It is unclear what child support\npayments he made before 2017 and why he was unemployed frequently.  He only produced proof\nof one payment toward the auto loan.  His alleged debts are recent and ongoing.  He has not shown\nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant provides documents and details about the SOR allegations that\nwere not previously presented to the Judge for consideration.1   Such matters constitute new\nevidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited from receiving or considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \n  \nApplicant argues that he has regularly made support payments to his children and believes\nhe is honoring his legal obligations, that he has acted responsibly in addressing his auto loan, and\nthat he was subjected to racial slurs on his mail route that led to the one-time lapse of judgment in\ndelivering newspaper flyers.  In a background interview in the record, Applicant indicated that he\nwas subjected to racial slurs on his mail route and reported that conduct to his supervisors without\nany follow-up action being taken.  FORM Item 4.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of\nthe evidence in the record, and Applicant has not rebutted that presumption in this case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-02854 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2016).  Notwithstanding that presumption, it was\nerror for the Judge not to address explicitly Applicant\u2019s explanation for the mail-handling offense,\neven if he found it not credible.  Given the adverse findings under Guideline F, the Judge\u2019s failure\nto discuss Applicant\u2019s explanation was harmless error.  Applicant also states that he is extremely\nsorry for his work misconduct and made a promise never to do such a thing ever again.  He\nmaintains that, since his misdemeanor offense, he has \u201cgrown tremendously in character and\nmatured in disposition.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 3.  His arguments amount to a disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not sufficient to establish that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016).  \nApplicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s decision.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 21, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had failed to file his Federal and state\nincome tax returns for ten years between 2002 and 2014; that he failed to file Federal and state\nincome tax returns for 2015 and 2016 in a timely manner; that the IRS wrote off his 2003 Federal\nincome tax debt; that he owes about $23,500 in past-due Federal taxes; and that he had four other\ndelinquent debts totaling over $17,000.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Federal\nand state tax deficiencies.  He also admitted one of the other alleged debts and denied the other three. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the Federal and state tax deficiencies and on two of the four\nother delinquent debts.  \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified a response to a question in a\n2017 security clearance application and falsified four responses to questions in a 2018 interrogatory. \nThese questions at issue involved his filing of Federal and state tax returns.  In his SOR response,\nhe admitted each of the falsification allegations.  The Judge found against Applicant on each of the\nfalsification allegations.    \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant raises a due process issue.

Furthermore, the record was left open for two weeks after the hearing to provide\nApplicant the opportunity to present additional matters.  (Tr. at 108).  Applicant has not established\nthat he was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive.  \nApplicant\u2019s brief also explains the circumstances surrounding his tax problems and his\nintentions for resolving them.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n26, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 22, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against him;\nwhether the Judge erred in finding that his omissions from his security clearance application (SCA)\nwere deliberate; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nBorn overseas, Applicant became a U.S. citizen in the late 1980s.  He served in the U.S.\nmilitary, both on active duty and in the National Guard.  Applicant studied for a master\u2019s degree but\ndid not complete the program.  However, he received an M.D. degree, although he has never\npracticed medicine.\nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists numerous delinquent debts, for student loans (totaling nearly\n$170,000), credit cards, a timeshare, telecommunication services, etc.  Applicant also had three\njudgments entered against him, for about $3,800, $4,900, and $930.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nbegan when his wife filed for divorce while he was in medical school.  He worked for a while at a\njob that paid him about $145,000 annually, but he was laid off when the mission ended.\nApplicant purchased a house using funds he had earned while employed, and it is worth about\n$200,000.  He stayed with his mother to care for her during an illness, for which he received a small\namount of compensation, and currently tries to earn money by selling merchandise.  He testified that\nhe lives on less than $10,000 a year.  He has made some payments toward his student loans.  He has\nnot received financial counseling.  He provided evidence that the statute of limitations has run on\nmost of his student loans.\nWhen completing his SCA, Applicant did not disclose the judgments against him or his other\ndelinquent debts.  He testified that he was not sure why he did not list his judgments, although it may\nhave been due to a mistake or to failing to understand the meaning of \u201cjudgment.\u201d  However, he\nadmitted that he attended a trial regarding one of the judgments listed in the SOR.  He also testified\nthat he did not know why he did not disclose his other delinquencies.  \nApplicant presented certificates and awards that he had received while in the military, letters\nof reference, and certificates of appreciation.  He does not believe that his financial problems raise\na security concern.  He cites to his honorable military service and his work as a contract employee. \nHe believes that his having previously been granted a security clearance shows that he should receive\n2\n\na favorable adjudication in the case before us.  He intends to pay his debts once he finds a well-\npaying job.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were ongoing, that he had not\ndemonstrated responsible action in regard to his debts, and that he had not made a good-faith effort\nto pay or resolve his debts.  Concerning Applicant\u2019s SCA omissions, the Judge stated that his\nexplanations therefor were not credible.  He admitted, for example, that he had been aware of the\njudgments and of the fact that he had been living off credit card debt while unemployed.  Though\nshe noted Applicant\u2019s military service, his support for the U.S. as a contract employee, and his\nsupport for his ailing mother, the Judge concluded that he had not demonstrated a track record of\ndebt resolution. She also concluded that Applicant\u2019s SCA omissions undermined his case for a\nfavorable decision.\nDiscussion\nMuch of Applicant\u2019s brief consists of assertions from outside the record, which we cannot\nconsider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  He argues that the Judge \u201c[went] out of [her] way to find anything\nthat insults the person\u2019s integrity and character to link it to the finance and support [her adverse\ndecision].\u201d Appeal Brief  at 1.  A Judge is presumed to be unbiased, and a party who asserts\notherwise has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App.\nBd. Aug. 7, 2018).  We find nothing in the record, particularly in the Judge\u2019s conduct of the hearing\nand in her written decision, that would likely convince a reasonable person that she lacked the\nrequisite impartiality.  Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s adverse rulings is not sufficient\nto support a claim of bias.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).\nApplicant denies that he deliberately falsified his SCA.  However, evidence regarding\nApplicant\u2019s educational attainments, the clarity of the questions at issue, and his awareness of the\nextent of his financial problems support the challenged finding.  We also note the Judge\u2019s adverse\ncredibility determination, to which we give deference.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  We conclude that the\nchallenged finding is supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d1  See ISCR\nCase No. 17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).\nApplicant cites to his military record, his support for U.S. objectives as a contractor, and his\nhaving held a clearance previously without incident or concern.  Applicant has not rebutted the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).

He settled one\nsmall credit card account for 45% of the balance due, but demonstrated insufficient\nefforts or means to resolve his remaining delinquencies or establish rehabilitation. \nResulting security concerns were not mitigated.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n3, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On February 27, 2019, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nRoger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we remand.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 44 years old, has a child from his first marriage and reported no military\nservice.  From 2002 to 2016, he worked for various employers with interspersed brief periods of\nunemployment and has since worked for his current employer.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a tax lien for about $2,600; a charged-off home equity\nloan for about $27,000, a mortgage account that was foreclosed in 2013; and a mortgage account\nthat was foreclosed in 2016.  Applicant admitted each SOR allegation with explanations.  The state\ntax lien has been resolved.  The home equity loan remains outstanding.  It is unclear whether either\nof the foreclosures resulted in deficiency balances.  The Judge found for Applicant on the tax lien\nand against him on the remaining three allegations.  Applicant has not established that his finances\nare sufficiently stabilized to meet the eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance.  \nDiscussion    \nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  In doing so, he argues his\nclearance was revoked based on \u201cinaccurate and or inexact\u201d information.1  Appeal Brief at 1.  We\nexamine disputed findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e.,\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App.\nBd. Apr. 20, 2018)(quoting Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \nOne significant error in the Judge\u2019s findings of fact involves the amount of one of the\nforeclosed mortgages.  In his background interview, Applicant stated that he cosigned a mortgage\nwith his mother that was foreclosed.2  The two credit reports in the record reflect the high credit\namount for that mortgage loan was about $86,300.  File of Relevant Material (FORM) Items 5 and\n6.  The Judge, however, found that Applicant had cosigned a note for that mortgage in the amount\n1 One of Applicant\u2019s contentions is that he provided proof that he paid the tax lien.  However, the Judge found\nin favor of him on that allegation.\n2 This mortgage was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.\n2\n\nof $206,450.  The Judge may have mistakenly relied on the amount of a non-alleged mortgage listed\nin one credit report instead of the foreclosed mortgage alleged in the SOR.3  The Judge also found\nthat it was unclear whether either of the foreclosed mortgages had deficiency balances.  The two\ncredit reports in the record, however, both reflect zero balances of each of the foreclosed mortgages. \nThe Judge did not address in his decision the zero balances in the credit reports.  Another error\ninvolves the Judge\u2019s reference to Applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure to timely file address his state tax obligations\n. . . .\u201d   Decision at 5.  Tax filing deficiencies were not raised as an issue in this case.  Applicant\nfurther notes that the Judge erred in finding that his daughter was from his first wife and that he had\nno military service.  Applicant\u2019s security clearance application reflects that he served four years in\nthe military and was honorably discharged.  FORM Item 3.\nThe Board has noted that: \u201cPublic confidence in the fairness and integrity of the industrial\nsecurity program depends, to a large degree, on there being both the substance and the appearance\nof a fair and impartial adjudication after reasonable consideration of the record evidence as a whole. \nIf an Administrative Judge makes statements or acts in a manner that could lead a reasonable person\nto question whether the Judge considered all the record evidence, then a party could understandably\nquestion whether he or she received fair consideration of the evidence it presented.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n02-23979 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2004).  In this case, the number of errors, some of which are\nsubstantial, in the Judge\u2019s decision raises this problem.  \nGiven the errors identified above, we conclude the best resolution of this appeal is to remand\nthe case to the Judge to correct the errors and to issue another decision consistent with the Directive.\n3 The non-alleged mortgage was listed as past-due 90 days in one credit report.  FORM Item 6.  In his\nbackground interview, Applicant indicated that he was able to obtain a loan modification for that mortgage and resolve\nits delinquency.

She\nindicated that she was working with her known creditors but provided no documentation\ncorroborating those efforts.  She admitted she has made little progress due to a lack of financial\nresources.  \u201cAfter three months of unemployment in mid-2009, she started a job earning about\n$45,000 and has received incremental salary increases ever since.\u201d  Decision at 2.  She has been in\nher current position for over two years, and her annual salary recently increased from $105,000 to\n$115,000.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on four of the alleged debts and against her on the\nremaining ones. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that her periods of unemployment totaled\napproximately one year and were the cause of her financial problems.  Information in the record\nreflects that she experienced periods of unemployment greater than the Judge found.  Her security\nclearance application and personal subject interview reflect that she experienced seven periods of\nunemployment between 2009 and 2016 totaling about 21 months.  Although the Judge may have\nerred in his finding regarding the scope of Applicant\u2019s unemployment, this constituted a harmless\nerror because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.

She argues, for example, that she is an extremely responsible and trustworthy individual. \nThese arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a\nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2\n(App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nZachary Knipe, Personal Representative\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n3, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested\na hearing.  On March 27, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether her right of cross-examination was\ndenied and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant was evaluated by a duly-qualified clinical psychologist in February 2018\nand found to have a poor prognosis for her mental-health stability because of her\nchronic borderline personality disorder and minimization of her need for ongoing\npsychotherapy treatment.  She exhibited adequate judgment and insight during a brief\nassessment for medication management with her treating psychiatrist in January\n2019, but it was not established that her condition no longer presents a security risk. \nClearance is denied. [Decision at 1.]\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered into evidence the report of a mental health\nevaluation that was conducted by a licensed clinical psychologist, which was marked as Government\nExhibit (GE) 2.  This evaluation was conducted at the request of the DoD Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility.  Applicant represented herself at the hearing and had no objection to the\nadmission of GE 2 into evidence.  Tr. at 22-23.\nIn her appeal, Applicant cites to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22 in arguing that her right of cross-\nexamination was denied because she did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the clinical\npsychologist who conducted the mental health evaluation reflected in GE 2.  This argument lacks\nmerit.  First, given Applicant's failure to object to GE 2 when it was offered at the hearing, she\ncannot now contend its admission into evidence or the Judge\u2019s consideration of it was an error.  See,\ne.g, DISCR OSD Case No. 92-1606 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 1995).  Although pro se applicants cannot\nbe expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their\nrights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-02371 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2014). \nSecond, the Appeal Board has consistently held that \u00b6 E3.1.22 does not provide a right of cross-\n2\n\nexamination concerning out-of-hearing statements that are admissible under other provisions of the\nDirective.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12461 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013).  In this case, GE 2\nis an admissible record under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 (official records or evidence compiled or created\nin the regular course of business).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-04696 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2013). \nFurthermore, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19 provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) shall serve as\na guide in DOHA proceedings.  GE 2 is also admissible into evidence under FRE 803(6)(records of\nregularly conducted activity).  The Judge\u2019s admission of GE 2 into evidence did not violate\nApplicant\u2019s right to cross-examination under \u00b6 E3.1.22. \nIn the decision, the Judge noted that \u201c[t]here is no assessment from a duly-qualified medical\nprofessional that classified information would not be at risk should Applicant be placed in a\nparticularly stressful situation in the future.\u201d  Decision at 14.  Applicant argues that her treating\npsychiatrist\u2019s progress note of January 17, 2019 (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A) provides such an \nassessment.  This assignment of error is not persuasive.  The scant progress note (relying on a 15-\nminute appointment) does not discuss whether or not Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions present\na security risk.  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge placed undo weight on GE 2, especially in light of\nevidence that she presented from her treating psychiatrist.  The weighing of evidence, however, is\na matter within the Judge\u2019s special province as the trier of fact in security clearance adjudications. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00857 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019)(citing Inwood Laboratories, Inc.\nv. Ives Laboratories Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 (1982)).  Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to\nshow the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On June\n29, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn April 18, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has been employed in low-paying jobs since 2007.  Her SOR lists numerous\ndelinquent debts, for vehicle accounts, education loans, medical expenses, utilities, etc.  About a\nmonth after she answered the SOR, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, and most\nof her debts were discharged in March 2019.  Her education loans were not discharged, however,\nand she has been making small, regular payments on them.  She was not successful in having her\neducation debts placed in forbearance.  Applicant makes about $425 each pay period.  Her character\nreferences recommend her for a clearance, although they did not disclose knowledge of her security-\nsignificant issues.  \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge is too recent to establish a track\nrecord of debt resolution.  Noting her monthly expenditures, he also concluded that she will still have\na problem with maintaining financial stability even after bankruptcy.  He stated that Applicant\u2019s\n\u201cwhole-person\u201d evidence\u2013for example, her character references\u2013were not sufficient to meet her\nburden of persuasion.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that she has not demonstrated that her\nproblems are resolved.  She contends that there is no evidence to show that her financial difficulties\nwill persist.  However, it is an applicant\u2019s job to present evidence in mitigation.
