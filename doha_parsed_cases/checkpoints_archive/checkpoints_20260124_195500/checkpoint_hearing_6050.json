Edmunds, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Foreign Preference and \nForeign Influence. Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 3, \n2006. On March 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline C \n(Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) for Applicant. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 26, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing in an undated response, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on March 30, 2007. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on September 6, 2007, and the case was assigned to \nanother administrative judge on September 10, 2007. Due to case load considerations, \nthe case was reassigned to me on September 12, 2007. On September 25, 2007, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on October 3, 2007. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Applicant \nExhibits A through D, which were received without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 18, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until October 12, 2007, to submit additional matters.  The Applicant \ntimely submitted AE E, which was received without objection. The record closed on \nOctober 12, 2007.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina \ncontained in Exs. I through IX. Applicant\u2019s counsel had no objection and I took \nadministrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which pertain to \nSerbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tr. 19-22. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) \n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to Serbia \nand Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina were derived from Exs. I through IX as \nindicated under subheading \u201cSerbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina\u201d of \nthis decision. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, \nbelow.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n  \nIn his Answer to the SOR received on March 30, 2007, Applicant admitted all of \nthe factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 2.a. through 2.e., with explanations. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old lab supervisor, who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since December 1989. He submitted his SF 86 as a first-time applicant at the \nrequest of his employer in January 2006. He was subsequently granted an interim \nsecret clearance and has successfully held that clearance for \u201c[a]bout one year\u201d without \nany security breaches. Tr. 28, 34, 38.   \n \nApplicant was born in 1956 in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former \nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He attended a university in Serbia and \nMontenegro from September 1975 to October 1982 and was awarded a \u201cteaching \ndegree,\u201d which Applicant described as \u201cequivalent\u201d to a bachelor\u2019s degree. In 1983, \nApplicant served mandatory military service in the Yugoslavian Army as a \u201cregular \nsoldier\u201d for approximately nine months.

He worked for a local newspaper \nfrom 1986 to 1989 as a technical editor and then as a journalist. \n \nApplicant has been married to his wife since June 1983. They were married in \nSerbia and Montenegro. They have two children, a 24 year-old daughter, and a 22-year-\nold son.  Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Serbia and Montenegro, his daughter was born in \nBosnia and Herzegovina, and his son was born in Serbia and Montenegro.  \n \n In August 1989, Applicant and his family immigrated to the U.S. Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1999, and was issued a U.S. passport \nin October 1999. Applicant holds dual citizenship with Bosnia and Herzegovina by birth. \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2001, and his son became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in January 1986.

She suffers from hypertension and has severe back problems. \nHis father is 82 years old and worked as a park ranger at a national park administered \nby United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). His \nfather is in very poor health and suffers from bladder cancer. In addition to cancer, he \nhas had two heart attacks and has a pacemaker. Applicant telephones his parents \n\u201cmaybe twice a month\u201d \u201cto see . . . if [his father is] alive.\u201d Tr. 48. When he visits his \nparents he gives them, \u2018[m]aybe $500, $600.\u201d Tr. 80. \n \nApplicant has two brothers, one is 47 years old, and the other is 32 years old. His \n47 year old brother is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of Serbia and \nMontenegro and is a resident of Serbia. He is employed by a municipality in Serbia as a \n\u201csecretary\u201d whose job description would encompass that of ombudsman. SOR \u00b6 2.d. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant telephones this older brother \u201conce or twice a month.\u201d GE 3. Applicant\u2019s 32 \nyear old brother is a farmer and lives with his parents on the family farm. Applicant \ntelephones his younger brother \u201conce a month.\u201d GE 3.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law was born in Slovenia and is a naturalized U.S. citizen \nliving in the U.S. He is a retired chef. Applicant and his wife see him about \u201conce a \nweek.\u201d GE 3. His mother-in-law is deceased. GE 1. \n \nApart from Applicant\u2019s 47 year old brother being a non-political municipal \nemployee, none of his immediate family is associated with or connected with the \ngovernments in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia and Montenegro.  \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and \nMontenegro with his two children; in July 2001, he traveled with his wife and two \nchildren to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro; in July 2002, he \ntraveled alone to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro; in July 2003, he \ntraveled alone to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro; in July 2004, he \ntraveled with his wife and son to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro; \nin July 2005, he traveled with his wife and two children to Bosnia and Herzegovina; and \nin October 2006, he traveled to Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. SOR \u00b6 2.e. All of \nthese visits were for the purpose of visiting his family. Not alleged was a visit Applicant \nmade to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro in July 2007. Tr. 74. \n \nThe President of Applicant\u2019s company testified on his behalf.  He holds a secret \nclearance and also is the facility security officer. The President interacts with the \nApplicant on a daily basis and knows the Applicant and his family personally and \nprofessionally. He stated Applicant \u201cis head and shoulders above the majority of his \ncolleagues and peers in terms of his skills, his knowledge, his thoughtfulness in his \napproach to his work, his ability to plan and schedule, his ability to instruct, and his \nability to motivate others that work in the test area and also in our assembly area \u2013 the \npeople that support the test lab in terms of providing parts for the test lab.\u201d Tr. 26. The \nPresident also wrote a reference letter stating, \u201cbased on over 27 years in [company] \nand over 40 years as a working and cleared professional, [Applicant] deserves the trust \nof the US Government.\u201d AE D. \n \nApplicant\u2019s company President stated, \u201cWe took time at the company to ascertain \nthat the clearance was really necessary for [Applicant\u2019s] work. After finding that our work \nwas expanding to include even more classified aspects, we submitted his request for a \nclearance.\u201d He also added, \u201cI can guarantee that his loyalty is to the USA, and that his \nconcerns are for the survival of our country in a very hostile world.\u201d \u201c[Applicant] is \ndedicated not only to the success of our company, but more importantly to the success \nof our country.\u201d AE D. \n \nThe Director of Operations, who holds a secret clearance, and Production \nManager also submitted reference letters on behalf of the Applicant. They interact with \nthe Applicant on a daily basis and hold the same view of the Applicant as the company \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nPresident. They reiterated Applicant is a dependable, trustworthy, and honest person. \nBoth witnesses recommended Applicant for a clearance. AE B, AE D.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin submitted a reference letter on his behalf. His cousin is a \nprincipal engineer and at one time worked for the same employer as the Applicant. He \nstated he has known the Applicant for over 13 years. He stated, \u201c. . . I have gotten to \nknow [Applicant] very well and I would never question his integrity or the commitment to \nthe United States of America. We are both immigrants to this country, which has \nbecome our home and we will both do what is necessary to protect it and keep it safe. \n[Applicant] is a person that I think of very highly and as myself a holder of a security \nclearance, I would recommend [Applicant] to be granted [a clearance], as his work, \nintegrity, and commitment will prove to be very valuable to the United States of \nAmerica.\u201d AE D. \n \nApplicant submitted a letter dated October 3, 2007 to the Embassy of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina renouncing his citizenship. AE E. SOR \u00b6 1.a. alleges as of February 2007 \nApplicant possessed a Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport issued in July \n1997 with an expiration date of July 2007. Not only has the passport expired, but the \nissuing country dissolved in the 2001 timeframe. See discussion infra under \u201cSerbia and \nMontenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u201d Since Applicant submitted a copy of his \nexpired Yugoslavian passport in Response to Interrogatories in February 2007, he does \nnot know where it is. Tr. 54-54, GE 2. Applicant has only used his U.S. passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 1999. Tr. 54-55. \n \nApplicant estimates his net worth to be approximately $300k. All of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial interests are in the U.S., which includes a home valued at $400k, 401(k) \nvalued at $110k, and checking and savings accounts. He has no financial ties to Bosnia \nand Herzegovina or Serbia and Montenegro. Tr. 82-84, 97-98. Applicant emphasized \nhis loyalty to the U.S. He enjoys and appreciates his way of life in the U.S. and has \nembraced being a U.S. citizen. He exercises his rights as a U.S. citizen to include \nvoting. Applicant\u2019s attitude is best summarized, \u201cI came here because I really wanted to \nbe here.\u201d Tr. 57. \n \nSERBIA AND MONTENEGRO and BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVENA1 \n \n \nIn April of 1992, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) formed as a self-\nproclaimed successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   In late 1998, \nF.R.Y. President Slobodan Milosevic unleashed a brutal police and military campaign \nwhich included atrocities against civilian noncombatants.  During this campaign, large \nnumbers of ethnic Albanians were either displaced from their homes in Kosovo or killed \nby Serbian troops or police. These acts, along with others, provoked a military response \nfrom NATO, which consisted primarily of aerial bombing. At the outset of hostilities \nbetween NATO and the F.R.Y., the United States and the F.R.Y. severed diplomatic \nrelations.  In October of 2000, Slobodan Milosevic conceded defeat in routine federal \n \n1The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I through IX.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nelections and, almost immediately, diplomatic relations with the United States improved.  \nIn November of that year the United States reestablished a diplomatic presence in \nSerbia, as the successor state to the F.R.Y., and formally reopened its embassy there in \nMay of 2001.  \n \n \n \nIn February 2003, F.R.Y.\u2019s parliament adopted a new Constitutional Charter \nestablishing the state union of Serbia and Montenegro.  In May 2006, the Republic of \nMontenegro held a successful referendum on independence.  After Montenegro\u2019s \ndeclaration of independence in June 2006, the parliament of Serbia stated that the \nRepublic of Serbia was the continuity of the state union, rendering the two republics \nindependent and sovereign countries. The Serbian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and \nthe U.S. Embassy in Belgrade have reestablished bilateral relations and provide a full \nrange of consular services. The newly-formed Republic of Serbia (Serbia) is a \nparliamentary democracy with approximately 7.5 million inhabitants.  \n \n \nSerbia\u2019s human rights record is variable.  The Government generally respects the \nhuman rights of its citizens and continues efforts to address human rights violations; \nhowever, numerous problems persist. Even though the Serbian Constitution prohibits \ntorture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, police at times \nbeat and harass detainees, usually during arrests or the initial phase of detention.  \nSerbian law also provides for freedom of speech and of the press; however, there were \nreports of government interference in these freedoms and reprisals against persons \nwho criticized the government.  Another noted concern is amongst minority religious \ncommunities who report continuing problems with vandalism of buildings, cemeteries, \nand other religious sites.   \n \n \n \n \nOccasional demonstrations occur and even demonstrations intended to be \npeaceful have the potential to turn into confrontational situations and to possibly \nescalate into violence.  Anti-American sentiment tends to be highest surrounding the \nanniversary dates of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign or during times of unusually \nhigh tension in Kosovo. \n   \n \nKosovo, which is legally still part of Serbia, remains an international protectorate \nof the United Nations. An international security presence, which is known as Kosovo \nForce (KFOR), works closely with the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to ensure \nprotection for all of Kosovo\u2019s communities.  Although the overall security situation has \nimproved, inter-ethnic tensions and sporadic incidents of violence continue to occur. \n \n \nFormer Yugoslavia began to unravel when Slobodan Milosevic took power in \n1986, because Milosevic\u2019s Serb nationalism led to intrastate ethic strife.  Slovenia and \nCroatia both declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.  In February 1992, the \nBosnian Government held a referendum on independence, and the Bosnia parliament \ndeclared independence on April 5, 1992.  However, Bosnian Serbs, supported by \nneighboring Serbia, responded with armed force in an effort to partition the republic \nalong ethnic lines to create a \u201cgreater Serbia.\u201d  In March 1994, Muslim and Croats in \nBosnia signed an agreement creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhowever, the armed conflict with between the Bosnian Muslim-Croat coalition and the \nBosnian Serbs continued until the November 21, 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement.  \nBosnia and Herzegovina was formed, and it is currently governed by a parliamentary \ndemocracy.  The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has favorable relations with \nthe United States, which itself participates in the Bosnian Peacekeeping force and has \ndonated significant funds to help with reconstruction, humanitarian assistance, \neconomic development, and military reconstruction. \n \n \nDue to the weak government in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Bosnia), the nation remains \nvulnerable to exploitation as a terrorist safe haven or as a potential staging ground for \nterrorist operations in Europe. Following the 1992-95 conflict between the Bosnian \nMuslims-Croat coalition and the Bosnian Serbs, an estimated several hundred Islamic \nradicals remained behind and became Bosnian citizens. Some al Qaeda operatives in \nBosnia reportedly had connections to members of Bosnia\u2019s intelligence service, due to \nal Qaeda\u2019s wartime cooperation with the Bosnian Muslims. Bin Laden and other al \nQaeda figures mention the Bosnian war as a place where al Qaeda was active.  \nBosnian Muslims receive humanitarian assistance from Saudi organizations which have \nserved as fronts for al Qaeda and have been used for planning attacks in Bosnia and \nelsewhere. In November 2004, the Bosnian Government charged 15 former Bosnian \nofficials with illegally helping around 700 former foreign Islamic fighters in Bosnia gain \nBosnian citizenship. In 2005, six former Bosnian Government officials were tried for \ntheir role in helping to establish an alleged terrorist training camp in Bosnia with Iran\u2019s \nhelp during the mid-1990s. Despite some recent counterterrorism successes, the \nGovernment\u2019s effectiveness has been generally hampered by insufficient coordination.  \n \n \n \nThe Bosnian Government\u2019s human rights record has remained poor, due to \nphysical abuse by police, overcrowding and poor prison conditions. Improper influence \non the judiciary, harassment and intimidation of journalists, government corruption, and \nethnically-motivated violence are problems in Bosnia. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)4 \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern regarding Foreign Preference,   \n\u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \n AG \u00b6 10(a) indicates one condition that raises a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to:  (1) possession of a current passport.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged Applicant as of February 2007 possessed a Socialist Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia passport issued in July 1997 with an expiration date of July \n2007. Although not alleged, Applicant held dual citizenship with Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. GE 1. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of this disqualifying condition, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country;   \n \n \n4 To the extent that AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(c) and 10(d) apply, they are clearly mitigated by AG \u00b6 11(c).   \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority or otherwise invalidated. \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a) partially applies because Applicant derived his citizenship as a result \nof his birth, and heritage to Bosnia and Herzegovina, formerly Yugoslavia.   \n \nAG \u00b6 11(e) fully applies. Regarding his Yugoslavian passport, it not only expired \nin July 2007, but was issued from a country that no longer exists. After becoming a U.S. \ncitizen in 1999, Applicant has only used his U.S. passport for travel abroad.  \n \nAlthough not alleged, Applicant did have dual citizenship with Bosnia and \nHerzegovina at the time the SOR was issued. To demonstrate his commitment to the \nU.S., he has taken the extra step of exceeding the requirement of \u201cexpress[ing] a \nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d as required in AG \u00b6 11(b) by notifying the \nEmbassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina by letter that he was formally renouncing his \nBosnian and Herzegovinian citizenship. \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nIf the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n11 \n \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk or foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontacts with his parents and one brother, who are citizens and residents of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and a second brother who is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nSerbia and Montenegro and resident of Serbia. These close relationships with his \nparents and brothers create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions primarily as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationship with his \nparents and brothers, his travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and \nMontenegro, and his non-U.S. citizen daughter who lives with him when she is not in \nmedical school. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nTwo Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s parents and one brother are not \nassociated with or connected with the Bosnian or Herzegovinian Government. His \nparents are elderly and in poor health. They along with Applicant\u2019s brother live on their \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nfamily farm. The other brother has a non-political job as an ombudsman for a \nmunicipality within Serbia and Montenegro. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s parents and \none brother do live in Bosnia and Herzegovina and his other brother lives in Serbia and \nMontenegro, and he has close emotional ties to them, as evidenced by his frequent \ntelephone calls and visits to those countries. With regards to his parents and brothers, \nApplicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of [his parents] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent \ncontacts with his parents and brothers could potentially force him to choose between \nthe United States and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro. On \nbalance, he did not fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his \nrelationship with his parents and brothers] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Applicant and his family, to include his non-U.S. citizen \ndaughter, have lived in the United States the last 18 years. He is completely vested in \nthe U.S. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen as well as his son. His daughter is a \npermanent resident alien with a pending application to become a U.S. citizen. His \nfather-in-law is a naturalized U.S. citizen and lives in the U.S. Appellant has developed \na sufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S., as he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He became a U.S. citizen in September \n1999. His wife became a U.S. citizen in June 2001. Applicant has been employed by his \ndefense contractor employer since December 1989, shortly after arriving in the U.S. and \nis very highly regarded at work. Applicant\u2019s contacts and linkage to the U.S. are much \ngreater than his linkage to Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia and Montenegro. He is \nheavily vested in the U.S., financially and emotionally. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d5 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.6 In addition to the \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro. He lived in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina for the first 33 years of his life. He was educated in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, and served in the Bosnian and Herzegovinian military. His parents and \none brother are citizens and residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and his other brother \nis also a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro. He has \nfrequent, non-casual contact with his parents and brothers. Applicant traveled to visit his \nfamily eight times since 2000.  He held a Yugoslavian passport.   \n   \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for the past 18 years, and he has \nbeen a naturalized citizen over eight years. The only passport he has used since \nbecoming a U.S. citizen is his U.S. passport. He has strong ties to the U.S. His wife, \nand two children as well as his wife\u2019s father all reside in the U.S. His children have \nspent their formative years in the U.S. and are both pursuing higher education. \nApplicant stated his position succinctly, \u201cI came here because I really wanted to be \nhere.\u201d  He is a successful lab supervisor. His parents are elderly and in poor health. \nNone of his immediate family members overseas are in positions placing them as likely \ntargets as a means to exploit Applicant. He has no financial ties overseas in contrast to \nhis U.S. financial ties. He took the affirmative step of formally renounce his Bosnian and \nHerzegovinian citizenship, which exceeds the requirement of \u201cexpress[ing] a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship.\u201d There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which \ncould cause potential harm to the United States.  Particularly noteworthy is the fact he \nhas successfully held a security clearance over one year. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer\u2019s confidence and trust in him is so high as to warrant \nrecommending him for a clearance. This was clearly demonstrated by his company \nPresident testifying on his behalf. Other company officials wrote letters of support. The \ncompany President has held a clearance over a substantial period of time. Applicant \ntakes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has worked diligently for his \nemployer for 18 years. His supervisors, family, and friends assess him as loyal, \ntrustworthy, conscientious, responsible, mature, and of high integrity. He has an \n \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n14 \n \n \n                                                          \nexcellent reputation as a friend, family member, employee and U.S. citizen. His \nwitnesses and documentary evidence recommend him for a security clearance. The \nGovernment did not produce any derogatory information about him nor did anyone \ncome forward recommending denial of his security clearance. \n \nAlthough the Government has no obligation to present evidence that Applicant \nand/or his family members are foreign agents, Applicant\u2019s family members are not, and \nnever have been, foreign agents. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro \nare developed, stable, democratic republic with a modern economy. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina has favorable relations with the U.S., and the U.S. has participated in the \nBosnian peacekeeping force and donated significant funds to help with reconstruction, \nhumanitarian assistance, economic development, and military reconstruction.  \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Bosnian and Herzegovinian and Serbian and \nMontenegro Governments or its agents might exploit or attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members in such a way that this U.S. citizen would have to choose \nbetween his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family members.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and preference.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On October 18, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 24, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mark E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge erred\nby concluding that the security concerns raised under Guidelines J and E had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application\n(SF-86) by failing to disclose that he had been court-martialed in 2003 for Burglary and Larceny of\nPrivate Property, and was ultimately found guilty of Wrongful Appropriation.  In support of this\ncontention, he argues that the Judge gave insufficient weight to his explanations, and gave too much\nweight to his Answer to the SOR, in which he had stated: \u201cI admit to willfully omitting information\nregarding court-martial proceedings while a member of the U.S. Army\u201d because \u201cthis was an\nextremely embarrassing time in my military career,\u201d and that he had omitted the information \u201cin an\nattempt to obtain a security clearance.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred.\nThe Judge\u2019s decision explicitly discussed Applicant\u2019s explanation as to why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  He was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  On this record, the\nJudge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised by his falsifications had not been mitigated, based upon the favorable record evidence,\nparticularly his lengthy military service, his many years of holding a security clearance without\nadverse incident, and his favorable employment and character evidence.  Again, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2003).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\n\n3\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s other security concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines J and E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR answer on December 10, 2007, and requested\na hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 7, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on January 24, 2008 scheduling it for February 5, 2008. The case was then\nrescheduled for February 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nMarch 24, 2008\n\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s counsel and department counsel, both of whom are licensed in the state where the\n1\ncrime occurred, a prayer for judgment is an option available for first-time offenders whereupon they can avoid\nsentencing, if granted at the judge\u2019s discretion.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is a 50-year-old married man\nwith two adult children. He is currently attending college (Tr. 63). He served in the U.S.\nArmy from 1975 through his retirement in 2004 when he was honorably discharged at\nthe rank of command sergeant major. Since retiring, he has worked for a defense\ncontractor as a transportation liaison for mobilization and demobilization operations on a\nmilitary base. He supervises 12 employees.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. His supervisor characterizes his\nperformance as \u201csuperb in every regard\u201d (Recommendation Letter, dated December 5,\n2007, as included in Answer at 4). According to a coworker, he exhibits \u201chigh standards\nof integrity, honesty, responsibility, and commitment\u201d (Exhibit D). He volunteers at\nchurch and participates in various youth mentor programs (Answer at 2).\nIn 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with secret peeping. He was tried in\na state court and found guilty (Tr. 65). At his request, the court then granted a prayer for\njudgment,  and the case was continued without an entry of guilt or a conviction. Also,\n1\nApplicant was ordered to serve one year of unsupervised probation (Tr. 70). Applicant\u2019s\nunit took no punitive actions against him after the incident, and it was not reflected in\nthat year\u2019s annual performance evaluation (Tr. 41).\nIn 2003, Applicant removed a computer and stereo equipment from a soldier\u2019s\nroom on a military base. The soldier reported the theft, and the military police contacted\nApplicant. He was charged with burglary and larceny of private property. Before the\ncourt-martial, he returned the property to the soldier (Id.). Applicant pleaded guilty to the\nburglary charge, and was found guilty of a lesser charge, wrongful appropriation of\nproperty. He was fined $6,000 (Answer at 1) and re-assigned to another unit. \nApplicant did not take the property with the intention of keeping it. Instead, he\ntook it to teach the soldier a lesson about leaving her room unlocked (Exhibit 3 at 2). He\nacknowledged, in hindsight, that \u201cit was a dumb thing to do,\u201d but reasoned it would have\nmore impact on the soldier for her to notice her property was missing \u201cversus telling\n[her] that she had them unsecured.\u201d The soldier was not in his chain of command.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in June 2005. He answered\n\u201cno\u201d to Question 25 (Your Police Record - Military Court In the last 7 years, have you\nbeen subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code\nof Military Justice?). His clerk prepared the rough draft of the application (Tr. 16). It was\nan extremely busy time when she completed the draft application because a major troop\nredeployment was occurring at the same time another company was assuming their\ncontract (Tr. 16 - Clerk\u2019s testimony). She had to complete draft applications for 11 other\n\n3\nemployees simultaneously (Tr. 18 - Clerk\u2019s testimony). Before inputting Applicant\u2019s\nfamily and employment history into the computer, she double-checked it with him. She\ndid not ask him about any derogatory criminal information because she \u201cjust didn\u2019t think\nthat anything like that had ever been in [Applicant\u2019s] past, or anything,\u201d (Tr. 18) and she\n\u201cassume[d] that he would check it over and make any corrections if it wasn\u2019t right\u201d (Tr.\n25).\nApplicant testified that he \u201csort of glanced through\u201d the application but did not\ncheck it thoroughly before executing it (Tr. 32). In his Answer, Applicant stated \u201cI admit\nto willfully omitting information regarding court-martial proceedings while a member of\nthe U.S. Army\u201d because \u201cthis was an extremely embarrassing time in my military career\u201d\n(Answer at 1). He omitted the information \u201cin an attempt to obtain a security clearance\u201d\n(Answer at 2).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n4\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b615). Applicant\u2019s omission of his court-martial from his 2005 security\nclearance application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. In Applicant\u2019s\nAnswer, he admitted unequivocally to falsifying the security clearance application, and\nhe provided an explanation for the falsification. Consequently, I do not believe his\ntestimony that the omission was unintentional.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I considered Applicant\u2019s clerk\u2019s testimony. Although\nshe testified credibly, it had little probative value in light of Applicant\u2019s admission in his\nAnswer. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.). Here,\nApplicant\u2019s 1998 criminal charge, his 2003 court-martial, and his security clearance\nfalsification raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single, serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted,\u201d apply.\nThe 1998 offense was remote in time and the 2003 offense happened under\nunusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Applicant is attending college, has a\ngood employment record, and is active in his community. However, his 2005\nfalsification, perpetuated at the hearing, constitutes an additional criminal offense under\n18 U.S.C. 1001. By undermining Applicant\u2019s credibility, it casts doubt upon his testimony\nregarding the surrounding circumstances of the earlier criminal conduct. I conclude\nApplicant has engaged in an unacceptable pattern of recurrent criminal conduct that\noutweighs the evidence of rehabilitation. None of the mitigating conditions apply, and his\ncriminal conduct remains a security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n5\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nI considered the whole person factors in my evaluation of the Criminal Conduct\nsection of the Decision. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information \nis granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 25, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \ne-QIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On August 30, \n2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nAugust 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nOn December 29, 2005, the President promulgated revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information, and on \nAugust 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the SOR was issued \non or after September 1, 2006.  The AG apply to Applicant\u2019s case because her SOR \nwas issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 5, 2007. In a sworn, written \nstatement, dated September 11, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on March 25, 2008, and the case was assigned \nto me the following day. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 31, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on May 7, 2008. \n \nDuring the hearing, three Government exhibits were received without objection. \nApplicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 15, 2008. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take \nAdministrative Notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to both the Ukraine and the \nRussian Federation (hereinafter Russia), appearing in two written submissions.

The process was finally completed \nand the visa was approved, and Applicant\u2019s mother is expected to relocate to the U.S. \nwithin a year, after she completes a scheduled surgery.24 Applicant speaks with her \nmother once or twice each week by telephone,25 and augments her very small pension \nby sending her approximately $2,000-$3,000 per year.26 \n \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Id. \n \n16 Id. \n \n17 Id. \n \n18 Id. at 1-2. \n \n19 Tr. at 50. \n \n20 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 12, at 2. \n \n21 Id.  \n \n22 Id. at 1. \n \n23 Id. \n \n24 Tr. at 32, 43, 49-50. \n \n25 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 12, at 4. \n \n26 Tr. at 59-60. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s husband, a world-renowned prize-winning scientist,27 was born in \nRussia in 1944.28 As noted above, they were married in 1982, immigrated to the United \nStates in 1994, and he, too, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2000.

It is undergoing profound political and \neconomic changes as it moves toward a market economy and multi-party democracy. \nThe first \u201cfree\u201d elections were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud. \nThe 2004 presidential election was condemned by the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) as flawed by pervasive electoral fraud, and the United \nStates and Europe refused to accept the results. The then-opposition candidate, Viktor \nYuschenko, was even poisoned with dioxin. Massive demonstrations helped to overturn \nthe former regime\u2019s electoral fraud, in what has been referred to as the \u201cOrange \nRevolution,\u201d so named after Viktor Yuschenko\u2019s campaign color. Ukraine\u2019s Supreme \nRada\u2014450-member unicameral parliament\u2014passed a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d in the \ngovernment, and the Ukraine Supreme Court invalidated the election results. A re-vote \nwas conducted and, in January 2005, Yushchenko became Ukraine\u2019s new President. \nSubsequent parliamentary and local elections in 2006 and 2007 were in line with \ninternational standards.  \n \nHaving inherited a military force of 780,000 from the Soviet Union, Ukraine is \nseeking to modernize with an eye toward achieving NATO, rather than the old Soviet, \nstandards. Ukraine has been an active participant in six United Nation peacekeeping \nmissions and has a small number of troops serving in supporting roles with Coalition \nforces in Iraq. Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy goals, supported by the pro-west President, \ninclude membership in the World Trade Organization, the European Union, and the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ukraine has peaceful and constructive relations with \nall its neighbors. Relations with Russia are complicated by differing foreign policy \npriorities in the region, energy dependence, payment arrears, disagreement over \nstationing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, and some boundary disputes. \nUkraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. \n \nPresident Bush visited Ukraine on April 1, 2008, and praised Ukraine\u2019s \ndemocratic and military reforms.  He noted:53 \n \nUkraine is contributing to every mission of the NATO Alliance, and \nhonoring the ideals that unite the transatlantic community.  This week, \nUkraine seeks to strengthen its transatlantic ties through a NATO \nMembership Action Plan.  The United States strongly supports your \nrequest. . . . [O]ur two nations share a common vision for the future.  We \nseek to advance a cause of freedom, and help all peoples of Europe live \ntogether in security and peace. \n \n \n53 White House Office of the Press Secretary, Press Release: President Bush and President Yushchenko of \nUkraine Exchange Luncheon Toasts, Apr. 1, 2008, at www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/print/20080401-\n4.html.  While this information was not included in Department Counsel\u2019s request, I take Administrative Notice of \nthese facts on my own initiative. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nDomestically, although there remain some serious human rights concerns, with \ncontinuing investigations to root out and solve the problems, Ukraine is largely free of \nsignificant civil unrest or any organized anti-American domestic political movements. \nAdditionally, freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by law and by the \nconstitution, and authorities generally respect these rights. \n \nThere is no evidence that Ukraine is an active participant in economic espionage, \nindustrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violations of export-control regulations. \n \nRussia \n \nRussia is composed of 21 republics. The Government consists of a strong \npresident, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature, and a weak judiciary often subject \nto political manipulation. It is a vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million \npeople. It achieved independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, \n1991, and remains a nuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially, \nand economically. On paper, Russia has recognized the legitimacy of international \nhuman rights standards, but it continues to be a \u201cpolice state\u201d where human rights \nabuses are rampant. There are numerous reports of human rights abuses, including law \nenforcement personnel engaged in torture, abuse, and violence to coerce confessions \nfrom suspects, with little accountability, despite the fact that the law prohibits such \npractices; widespread corruption within the police force; arbitrary arrest and detention; \npolitically motivated arrests; abductions; and life threatening prison conditions. The \nmedia is largely state-controlled. There are restrictions on freedom of movement within \nthe country, and all adults must carry government-issued internal passports while \ntraveling internally, and they are required to register with the local authorities within a \nspecified time of their arrival at a new location. \n \nRussia\u2019s two main intelligence services are the Russian Foreign Intelligence \nService (SVR) and the main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), both \noverseen by the Russian National Security Council and coordinated through the \nPermanent Interbranch Commissions of the National Security. Its intelligence capability \nis significant and focuses on collection of information from the United States. The Soviet \nUnion engaged in a series of high profile espionage missions against the United States, \nand Russia has continued the tradition. As of 2005, Russia was one of the two most \naggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounted for the \nmajority of such targeting. Russia also provides technologies which could be used in the \nconstruction of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other countries. It is a \nleading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and military-related \ntechnology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela.  Nevertheless, the United States and \nRussia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including counterterrorism \nand the drastic reduction of our strategic arsenals.54 \n \n \n54 It is interesting to note that because of closer diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, \nat some unspecified time prior to 1999, the U.S. State Department started issuing Russian diplomats \u201cno escort \nrequired\u201d badges to wear during visits to the State Department building. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nRussia has attempted to reassert its dominance in, and integration of, the former \nSoviet states and has generally been successful with Belarus and Armenia. It has \nremained unwelcomingly active in the internal affairs of several of its neighboring \ncountries\u2014former republics of the Soviet Union or occupied \u201cindependent countries\u201d\u2014\nsuch as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, and has issued threats against \nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Estonia. \n \nU.S. citizens who have, at one time, held Russian citizenship, may be required to \nrenounce Russian citizenship before applying for a Russian visa in their U.S. passport.  \nUnless a Russian citizen has formally renounced his or her Russian citizenship, he or \nshe risks being considered a Russian citizen and not allowed to depart except on a \nRussian passport. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d55 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \n \n55 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9:       \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 10(a), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member\u201d is \npotentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), this includes but is not limited to:  \n\u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 10(d) \u201cany statement \nor action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States: for example, \ndeclaration of intent to renounce United States citizenship; renunciation of United States \ncitizenship\u201d may raise security concerns. \nAfter becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2000, Applicant retained the \nRussian passport that had been previously issued to her, and used it to travel to Russia \nin 2000, despite already having been issued her U.S. passport. And, in 2003, she \nrenewed the Russian passport, and eventually used it for her trips to the Ukraine in \n2005 and 2006. By her actions, she exercised the rights and privilege of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(d) apply. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign preference.  Under AG \u00b6 11(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where the \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or \nbirth in a foreign country.\u201d  Similarly, AG \u00b6 11(b), may apply where \u201cthe individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  Also, AG \u00b6 11(e) may apply \nwhere \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d \n \nApplicant explained that her only motivation for using her Russian passport in \n2000, 2005, and 2006, was not an indication of a preference for Russia over the United \nStates, but rather solely for her convenience and cost-savings while traveling to Russia \nand the Ukraine, and it was not her intention to reflect a preference for Russia over the \nU.S.  Furthermore, until 2007, she was unaware of the potential security significance of \nretaining or using her Russian passport. \n \n \nThus, the issue, distilled to its basic components, is: whether Applicant's actions \nin failing to formally renounce her Russian citizenship under Russian law, and her \nrenewing, possessing, and using her Russian passport, were merely for personal \nconvenience and cost-savings, or indicative of a preference for Russia over the United \nStates. Considering Applicant\u2019s explanations, and her subsequent action in \nsurrendering and destroying her Russian passport, and her stated willingness to \nrenounce her Russian citizenship, I find \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), 11(b), and 11(e) apply. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.56 Applicant\u2019s relationship with her mother in the \n \n56 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nUkraine and her two sisters-in-law in Russia, and her travels to both countries, are \ncurrent concerns for the Government. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply in this case.  \nHowever, the security significance of these identified conditions requires further \nexamination of Applicant\u2019s respective relationships with her family members who are \neither Russian or Ukrainian citizen-residents to determine the degree of \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.@ Similarly, AG \u00b6 8(b) may \napply where the evidence shows Athere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.@ In addition, AG \u00b6 8(c) may apply where \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  In this instance, \nher relationship with those family members is neither casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply.  \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant \nfactors, including the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the \nrealistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States.57  In fact, the Appeal Board has \n \n57 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. \n10, 2002). \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ncautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations \nand \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d58 \n \nNevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the United \nStates may be relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it \ncontrols is likely to attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to take action against the \nUnited States through the Applicant.  It is reasonable to presume that although a \nfriendly relationship, or the existence of a democratic government, is not determinative, \nit may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. \ncitizen through relatives or associates in that foreign country. \n \nAs noted above, since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States and \nUkraine have developed an increasingly warm and friendly relationship making it \nunlikely that the Ukraine Government would attempt coercive means to obtain sensitive \ninformation.  However, it does not eliminate the possibility that Ukraine would employ \nsome non-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit a relative.  While Applicant\u2019s \nmother still resides in Ukraine, at least until she is able to emigrate later this year, there \nmay be speculation as to \u201csome risk,\u201d but that speculation, in the abstract, does not, \nwithout more, establish sufficient evidence of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a \nsecurity clearance.  As to her mother in Ukraine, I find AG \u00b6 8(a) applies in this case.  \n \nRussia is a different matter because it continues to be a \u201cpolice state\u201d where \nhuman rights abuses are rampant, with little accountability.  As of 2005, Russia was one \nof the two most aggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and \naccounted for the majority of such targeting.  Russia\u2019s relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that \nApplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. The complicated relationship of Russia to the United States places a \nsignificant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate \nthat her sisters-in-law in Russia do not pose a security risk and she is not in a position \nto be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and those extended-family \nmembers. With its occasionally adversarial stance and its mixed human rights record, it \nis conceivable that Russia could target any citizen in an attempt to gather information \nfrom the United States. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-law are, or have been, political \nactivists, challenging the policies of the Russian Government. There is no evidence that \nterrorists have approached or threatened Applicant or her sisters-in-law for any reason. \nThere is no evidence the Russian Government has approached Applicant. There is no \nevidence that her sisters-in-law living in Russia currently engage in activities that would \nbring attention to themselves or that they are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, \n \n58 ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nthere is a reduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by \nthe Russian Government, which may seek to quiet those who speak out against it.  \nMoreover, the children and grandchildren of both sisters-in-law reside in the United \nStates, removing one substantial potential source of Russian pressure on either sister-\nin-law. The situation is mitigated because of the reduced possibility that Russia will \nexploit her sisters-in-law. She has met her burden of showing there is little likelihood \nthat those relationships could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation. As to her \nsisters-in-law in Russia, I find AG \u00b6 8(a) applies in this case.  \n \nApplicant has been a resident of the United States since 1994. She and her \nhusband became naturalized U.S. citizens, and their two children and his son and \ngrandson all reside in the United States. She surrendered her Russian passport and \nshe is willing to renounce her dual citizenship. They have no foreign financial interests \nin Russia or the Ukraine. He is fully involved in his children\u2019s lives and activities. \nApplicant and her husband have \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., that [they] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  I find AG \u00b6 8(b) applies in this case. \n \nIt is true that, since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000, Applicant took one trip to \nRussia and two trips to Ukraine to visit either her mother or her sisters-in-law.  At the \ntime of her 1998 trip to Russia, she was still a Russian citizen, and that trip should have \nno current security interest.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant and her \u201cclosest family\u201d\u2014\nher husband, and their two children\u2014have resided in the U.S. since 1994, and became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in 2000.  Her husband\u2019s son and grandson also reside here. \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nLikewise, the families of her two sisters-in-law reside in the U.S., and her mother will \nsoon join the family here. As such, they are not vulnerable to direct coercion or \nexploitation, and the realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress \nwith regard to them is low. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Russia and Ukraine must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situations in those countries, as well as the dangers \nexisting there. Russia is a diplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some \nareas where both countries have mutual interests. Russia is a key partner in the search \nfor peace in the Middle East and resolution of problems with Iraq and Iran. Russia, then \na part of the Soviet Union, was an important ally in World War II, and then our greatest \nantagonist during the Cold War.  Russia has a mixed human rights record, and like the \nUnited States, has been subject to terrorist attacks. Russia is a known collector of U.S. \neconomic intelligence and proprietary information, but the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress based upon Applicant\u2019s remaining ties to Russia\u2014her \ntwo sisters-in-law without any affiliation or relationship to the Government of Russia\u2014\nare insufficient to raise a security concern. \n \nUkraine, on the other hand, is a rapidly developing multi-party democracy, \ncontributing to NATO Alliance missions. Ukraine has aligned itself with the West and \napplied for NATO membership, an action supported by the U.S. because both nations \nshare a common vision for the future. It is in Ukraine\u2019s interests to maintain friendship \nwith the U.S. to counterbalance Russia, and it is very unlikely Ukraine would forcefully \nattempt to coerce Applicant through her mother still residing in Ukraine. Furthermore, \nthere is no evidence that Ukraine is an active participant in economic espionage, \nindustrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violations of export-control regulations. \n(See AG & 2(a)(8).) \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s actions in renewing and using her Russian passport on three \noccasions after she became a naturalized U.S. citizen, they raise several different \nissues. When Applicant renewed her Russian passport, she had no intention of \nreflecting a preference for Russia over the United States. At that time, she was unaware \nof the security significance of her actions. When she did learn of the significance, \nApplicant took immediate steps to relinquish her Russian passport, and did so in May \n2007, when she surrendered it to her employer\u2019s security department and it was \ndestroyed by burning.  (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)(5), 2(a)(7), and \n2(a)(9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her foreign influence \nand foreign preference concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Her mother-in-law is a dual national with the U.S., and her father-in-law\nhas a green card.  However, they both reside in Iran.  Her mother-in-law is a retired secretary, and\nher father-in-law is an architect.  Neither in-law is in the employ of the Iranian government.

[her foreign relatives] . . . and\nthe interests of the U.S.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 16, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on March 15, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on March 27, 2007, and the case was heard on April 10, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on April 19, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether\nthe Applicant's perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence  militate against the granting of\na security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 36, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence\nin the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of\nfact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n1.a.~1.d. and 2.c.  The Applicant is a native born American (TR at page 16 lines 1~5).  She\nmarried an Iranian national in 1994 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 3).  He subsequently\nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1999 (Id).  She became a dual national with their marriage (TR at page 16\nlines 6~14, and at page 19 line 5 to page 20 line 13).  She obtained an Iranian passport in order to\nvisit her in-laws in Iran, in 1996 and again in 1998 (TR at page 21 line 6 to page 22 line 7).  The\nApplicant has recently renounced her Iranian citizenship, and destroyed her Iranian passport\n\n3\n(Applicant Exhibits (AppXs) D and E).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant\u2019s 71 year old mother-in-law is a dual national with the U.S., and\nher 75~76 year old father-in-law has a green card, as a permanent resident alien (TR at page 23 line\n12 to page 27 line 14).  They both currently reside in Iran (Id).  Her mother-in-law is a retired\nsecretary, and her father-in-law is an architect (TR at page 23 line 12 to page 27 line 14).  Neither\nin-law is in the employ of the Iranian government (Id).\nThe Applicant would report any attempt at coercion vis-a-vis her in-laws to her \u201cSecurity\nOfficer,\u201d and to the appropriate U.S. authority (TR at page 29 lines 8~22).\nIran is a state that sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran\nsince 1980.  It is a theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power\nstructures, and ultimate political authority is vested in a learned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and\nworsening human rights record presents a further threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians\nemigrated to the U.S. in 1979, after their Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind\nfamily members in Iran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political prisoners for\nharassment purposes.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\n\n4\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, was a dual national with Iran, and maintained an Iranian\npassport.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there\nwas an \"exercise of any right . . . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . . .  This\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  The second\ndisqualifying condition is also applicable, as there was \u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of\na foreign citizenship by an American citizen.\u201d  These are countered, however, by the second and fifth\nmitigating conditions. \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d\nand \u201cthe passport has been destroyed . . .\u201d  Here, the Applicant has not only initiated the renunciation\nof her Iranian citizenship, but has also destroyed her Iranian passport.\nThe Applicant's in-laws are citizens of and reside in Iran.  The first and second disqualifying\nconditions under Foreign Influence are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential\nconflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d\nUnder the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first and second\nmitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with her Iranian in-laws is \u201csuch\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof . . . [her family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Her Facility Security Officer\n(FSO) avers that she is \u201cvery trustworthy and reliable\u201d (AppX A).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation\n\n5\nunder the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B and C are found for the\nApplicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met\nher ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.

Applicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. She denies allegation 1.b. All specific admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. After considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation. Guideline B (Foreign Influence) 1.a. -- Applicant\u2019s 60-year-old mother is a native-born citizen and resident of Russia. She was a teacher of \"little kids\" until she retired about three years ago. Now, she basically takes care of her home (Tr at 28, 41). She has never worked for the Russian government (Tr at 44). Applicant\u2019s mother came to the U.S. once, to attend Applicant\u2019s wedding in 2005 (Tr at 43). They speak on the phone about once a month and occasionally exchange cards (Tr at 44).

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 34-ear-old linguist/interpreter was born in Russia (then the USSR) in 1974 to a Russian\nmother and a Yemeni father.  The father subsequently returned to Yemen.  Applicant came to the\nUnited States (U.S.) in the early 1990s to attend college, married twice to U.S. citizens, and became\na naturalized citizen in 2002.  She has provided translation services to the US military and other\nagencies, receiving substantial high praise for her dedication and loyalty to U.S. interests.  Her\nmother is a citizen/resident of Russia and her father is a citizen/resident of Yemen.  Both are retired\nand have no connection with their governments.  Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are of long standing and\ndeep.  Mitigation has been adequately established.  Clearance is granted. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn May 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \nOn August 23, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The matter was assigned\nto me on September 19, 2007. On October 9, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the\nhearing for November 8, 2007. At the hearing the Government introduced five (5) exhibits\n(Government\u2019s Exhibit (GX) 1 - 5). At the hearing, the Government also offered eight (8) Official\nNotice Documents, relating to Russia, which were marked as Official Notice (ON) Documents I-VI.\nThe Applicant testified and introduced eight (8) exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A - H. After\nthe hearing, the Government submitted six (6) additional Official Notice Documents, relating to\nYemen.  Applicant submitted four more documents as evidence (AX I-L). All exhibits and Official\nNotice documents were admitted. The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on November 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 33-year-old linguist/translator for a defense contractor. The SOR contains five\n(5) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Applicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.c., 1.d.,\nand 1.e. She denies allegation 1.b. All specific admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as\nFindings of Fact. \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT\nas to the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation. \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n1.a. -- Applicant\u2019s 60-year-old mother is a native-born citizen and resident of Russia. She was\na teacher of \"little kids\" until she retired about three years ago. Now, she basically takes care of her\nhome (Tr at 28, 41). She has never worked for the Russian government (Tr at 44). Applicant\u2019s\nmother came to the U.S. once, to attend Applicant\u2019s wedding in 2005 (Tr at 43). They speak on the\nphone about once a month and occasionally exchange cards (Tr at 44). Her mother does not know\nwhat Applicant does or that she is seeking a security clearance. \n1.b. - Applicant\u2019s 63-year-old father is a citizen and resident of Yemen. Before he retired,\nhe was an agricultural specialist for the Yemeni government, and worked with American and\nEuropean organizations such as U.S. Aid and the United Nation\u2019s Food and Agricultural\nOrganization (FAO). He was a resident of Russia when Applicant was born to him and Applicant\u2019s\nmother. Applicant visited him in Yemen in 2001 (GX 5) and 2005 (Tr at 48). She considers them\n\n3\nto be \"not extremely close (Tr at 46) or \"average\" (Tr at 47). They speak about once a month (Id.).\nHe knows that she works as a translator, but not what she does or that she is seeking a security\nclearance (Trat 48).\nAs s far as Applicant knows, neither her father nor mother has been politically active (Tr at\n29).  It is improbable\" that either one will be placed in a \"politically compromising position (Id.).\n1.c. - Applicant\u2019s sister was born in Russia but is now a citizen and resident of France. She\nis married to a French citizen and is a homemaker (Tr at 30). She as is not politically active (Id.).\n1.d. - Applicant\u2019s aunts are native-born citizens and residents of Russia. She has contact with\nonly one of her aunts, who is in her late 70s, but the contact is \"very limited\" (Tr at 30). She has no\ncontact with the other aunt (Tr at 30, 31). \n1.e. - Applicant has traveled to Russian on two occasions. Her purpose is to visit her mother.\nShe sees herself as a dutiful daughter (Response to SOR and Tr at 31). The shared activities center\non food, talk, and walks around the area (Id.). Since obtaining her U.S. passport in 2002, she has\nused that passport for all travel purposes (Tr at 40). \nApplicant came to the U.S. in about 1992, when she was 18. Thus, she has lived in the U.S.\nfor about half of her life, including the \"formative years\" (Tr at 32). She was educated in American\nschools, attended an American university, and received a B.A. in communications. She became an\nAmerican citizen in March 2002, at which time she obtained a U.S. passport. Her Russian passport\nexpired in May 2002 and was never renewed. \nSince taking the oath of allegiance to the U.S., which included renouncing any allegiance to\na foreign nation, she has not considered herself to be a dual citizen of Russia (GX 1, GX 2, and GX\n5). She owns property here, worth about $500,000 (Tr at 36) and is married to an American citizen\n(Tr at 32).\nHer sole tie to Russia is the presence of her mother and aunt being there. Her sole tie to\nYemen is the presence there of her father. She has never lived there since her teens.  She has no\nconnection with either its government or its culture, or that of Yemen. Beyond what she has\ndescribed, she has no personal, financial, or emotional ties to either country (Tr at 50-53). Applicant\nonce told her parents she was working as an interpreter is a \"court or medical\" setting. She has never\ntold them differently (Tr at 55). \nApplicant avers that: \n\u201cThis country has given me much for which I am very grateful, and I believe roots\nrun deep here. I am a loyal, law abiding citizen of the U.S., would not act in any way\nwhich would be inconsistent with the interests of this country. I have never acted in\na way which would cause anyone to question my loyalty to the United States of\nAmerica\u201d (Tr at 33; see, also GX 2). \n\n4\nApplicant submitted a letters of thanks from the Department of Homeland Security (AX K)\nand an enthusiastic letter of recommendation from a Marine Corps Lt. Colonel commanding the\nDetachment that used her translation service (AX L)  \nPOLICIES \nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nin all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (Directive, Enclosure 2 at Section 2, pages 18, 19). I have considered\nall nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \"clearly consistent with the national interest\" for an individual to hold a security\nclearance. An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations. If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant. \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \"any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\" \nOfficial Notice Documents \nThe Government has introduced Official Notice Documents pertaining to Russia and Yemen,\nbut not France. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s having a sister in France is not considered\na security concern by the Government. \nThe first set of Official Notice documents discusses the official U.S. concern with Russia -\nthat it continues to maintain an ongoing program of actively collecting military and economic\ninformation within and against the United States. The details are found in Official Notice Documents\n\n5\n1-8 and abstracted in Department Counsel\u2019s Administrative Notice cover document of September\n18, 2007. \nThe second set of Official Notice Documents shows that the official U.S. concern with\nYemen is that Yemen is that the government has a poor human rights record, is often corrupt, and\ntends to tolerate, if not assist or even encourage terrorist groups acting against its own people and\nforeigners, including Americans. The details are found in Official Notice Documents 9-14 and\nabstracted in Department Counsel\u2019s Administrative Notice cover document of November 13, 2007.\nSpecifically, the U.S. State Department recently warned of a growing presence by Al Qaeda and a\nterrorist threat considerably higher than in the past (U.S. Dept of State, Travel Warning - Yemen,\nSeptember 24, 2007). These documents do not indicate that Yemen is considered to be actively\ninvolved in espionage or gathering sensitive information relating to the U.S. The concern is more\nwith terrorist elements operating in that country. \nThe Official Notice Documents indicate that both countries are in the high risk category as\nto espionage, the gathering of sensitive information, and/or terrorist activities. Accordingly, as to\nboth countries, Applicant has a heavy burden of establishing that, despite the Government\u2019s\nconcerns, it is nonetheless consistent with the national interest for Applicant to have access to the\nnation\u2019s secrets. \nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is a 33-year-old linguist/translator. She was born in Russia to a Russian mother\nand a Yemeni father and grew up fluent in both Russian and Arabic. When she was a child, her\nfather returned to Yemen. Applicant was working as a linguist/translator when she was recruited by\nher current employer, who wanted her to work on contracts that required a security clearance,\nincluding in Iraq (Tr at 56). For several years, she has been working on non-classified aspects of that\nposition. \nAs is the case with all Applicants who reported family and relatives in foreign counties,\nApplicant faces the logically difficult, if not impossible, task of proving a negative; i.e., that\nsomething that has not happened in the past is at risk of happening in the future. \nWhat she can establish how she is likely to act in the future. Applicant came to the U.S. in\nabout 1992, to attend college. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2002 (Tr at 22 and GX\n1 and GX 5). Her present employer contracts with the Department of Defense to provide translation\nof oral and written material in a variety of foreign languages. Applicant is fluent in Russian and\nArabic. The company hired her two ears ago to provide \"simultaneous translation\" services.\" There\nis a real need of linguists with her level of competence and they are in short supply\" (AX A). \nAnother company for whom she has provided such services evaluates her as follows: \nWe \u201cbelieve [her] to be a dedicated and highly competent individual and with her qualities\nand numerous abilities she is an invaluable asset to any workplace. I highly recommend [her] as a\ncandidate to be approved for any sensitive government work for which she is applying (AX B).\" \n\n6\nA Special Agent of  the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) praises her work in\ninterpreting words spoken in dialects of a foreign language and recommends her for a security\nclearance. The DEA agent was so impressed with her work ethic that she was given access to highly\nsensitive information. She was considered to be a \"trustworthy employee who exemplified high\nlevels of integrity and a strong work ethic, unparalleled by any other translator I have worked with\"\n(AX C).\nApplicant states that she has worked a translator for about 10 years, including providing\nservices for several U.S. Government agencies.  She has always done so with \"utmost care\" and does\nnot discuss sensitive information with any third parties. Her \"family [overseas] does not know the\nnature of [her] work and therefore cannot be put in any compromising position.\" She has not had any\nproblems with the several U.S. Government agencies with whom she has worked (AX D). \nApplicant has documented the nature of her past employment. A recent letter from her\nemployer states that Applicant: \nhas worked under contract . . . to support US government personnel and/or military\npersonnel in performing translations and interpretations in support of the War on\nTerrorism; full-time work in excess of 50 hours/week usually under harsh and austere\nconditions, required travel for extended periods of time\" (AX E of October 17, 2007).\n         \nHer employer also cites Applicant as having been granted an \"interim Secret\" clearance\" by\n\"DISCO\" in 2003/2004, with no cited problems (AX F, of October 4, 2007). On October 12, 2007,\nshe received a \"Certificate of Appreciation\" from a U.S. Army Civil Affairs Battalion: \"In\nRecognition of [her] generous contribution to the invaluable training of our Soldiers. We sincerely\nexpress our gratitude and thanks\" (AX G).\n             \nLast, Applicant has documented her financial ties to the U.S. - her ownership of a home\nvalued at more than $200,000 (AX H). \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or indeed to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interests. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nDisqualifying Condition - 7.(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion\n\n7\nMitigating Conditions - 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and 8.(b) there\nis no conflict of interest, either because of the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, organization, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict\nof interests in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn summary, as established by her own words and conduct, and the highly favorable\ncomments from others in positions of considerable security significance, Applicant has (1)\ndemonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States, (2) renounced her Russian\ncitizenship upon becoming an American, (3) never renewed her Russian passport; and (4) has\nshown such strong ties to the United States by marriage and by placing herself in dangerous\npositions in defense of U.S. interests, that no \"heightened risk\" has been shown.  \nI conclude that  Applicant would never act inappropriately in a national security context.\n(Guideline B: Foreign Influence at 7.(a). To the contrary, even with her parental ties to Russia and\nYemen, the record demonstrates that she \"can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest\u201d (Id., at 8.(b)).  \nIn conclusion, the totality of the record, evaluated under the \"whole person\" concept, shows\nthat Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of someone seeking\na security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal Findings for or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of th Directive are as follows:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 1\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b. \nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor the Applicant \n\n8\nDECISION \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nBARRY M.

She filed bankruptcy four times since 1997.\nHer financial problems were a result of her former husband\u2019s financial irresponsibility and lack of\nsteady employment.  She has successfully mitigated the security concerns associated with her\nfinancial problems.  Clearance is granted.\n\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86)(e-QIP version), dated July 28, 2005).\n1\nId. at 1, 13.\n2\nAnswer to SOR, Attachment D, Divorce Decree, dated June 29, 2006, at 1-40.\n3\nItem 4, supra, note 1, at 26-27, 30.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 28, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 23, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  The Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the\nSOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006,\nDoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated letter, and requested a decision without\na hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the\ngovernment\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on July 19, 2007.  Applicant was\nafforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by August 18, 2007.  She filed a response which was received by DOHA on August 21,\n2007.  The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 40-year-old software configuration analyst  employed by a defense contractor.2\nShe was married on July 6, 1991, and divorced on June 29, 2006.  Three children were born of the\nmarriage, and they are in the primary physical custody of Applicant.   She has a master\u2019s degree in\n3\nindustrial engineering.  She has no prior military service.  This case arose out of a periodic renewal\nof her security clearance.4\nApplicant had four past-due debts totaling approximately $33,541.  On June 2, 1997, she\nfiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, which was subsequently converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy\non December 11, 1997.  On March 4, 2002, she filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13,\nand this case was dismissed on September 30, 2002.  On November 1, 2002, she again filed a\n\nItem 3, supra, note 3, at 1-4.\n5\nId.\n6\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM (Letter from Stevie Edward VanPelt, dated July 26, 2007) at 1.\n7\n4\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition, which was dismissed on June 25, 2003.  On June 2, 2003, she filed\nanother chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, which was dismissed on December 10, 2004.5\nAfter Applicant and her former husband had their first child, they struggled financially\nbecause her ex-husband could not find steady employment.  They sought help for a budget\ncounseling service for debt consolidation but were informed that there was nothing they could do.\nThey then filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in effort to keep their home and car and keep up with the\nadditional expenses of an infant.  The chapter 13 payment was set too high.  Her husband took care\nof paying the bills, and at the time she was unaware of his terrible spending habits.  He maintained\nsteady employment from August 1998 to October 2001.  In November 2001, after they purchased\na home, she had their third child.  Due to his unemployment, they exhausted their savings quickly.\nThey filed bankruptcy in March 2002, in an effort to save their home and cars..  Additionally, two\nchildren required treatment for asthma and eczema, which necessitated expensive over-the-counter\nproducts, medicines, and frequent urgent/emergency care visits.  At that time the children were ages\nsix, two, and four months.  Childcare expenses were paid so that her then husband could look for a\njob.  He lied to her, claiming that he had jobs, but he never produced a check.  She filed bankruptcy\nagain in November 2002, because her husband was not employed, and they continued to struggle\nwith their finances.  She re-filed bankruptcy in June 2003 as a re-submission, but without a second\nincome, she could not keep up with the payments.  Her ex-husband at times stole her credit cards,\nmoney, and checkbook out of her purse.  He would often request extensions on the bills, but instead\nof paying them he would tell her he had taken care of the bills when in fact he had not.  She\nseparated from her husband in June 2005, filed, and obtained a divorce in June 2006.  Since that\ntime, she has been able to live within her means, and was able to do so without child support from\nJune 2005 to December 2006.  She has paid her rent and car note regularly every month for over two\nyears.  And she has started paying back her student loan.6\nIn response to the FORM, Applicant attached a notarized statement from her ex-husband\ndated July 26, 2007, in which he accepted responsibility for the debts listed in the SOR\n(subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.)  He further stated that other financial problems and hardships were\nbeyond her control.  It was his idea in all instances to file bankruptcy.  He advised her to sign the\npaperwork in an effort to save their home.  However, he did not maintain steady employment, and\nhe felt that she should not be held accountable for these debts.7\n \nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n8\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005);  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n9\n \nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.  Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n8\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.9\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n10\n6\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.10\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nThe government established its case under Guideline \u00b6 19.  Two Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying\nin this case: Guideline \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and Guideline \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Applicant has a history of not meeting debts, as set\nforth in the SOR and government exhibits.\nThree Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20 (b)\n(c), and (d) are applicable.  Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are based on her former husband\u2019s\nirresponsible spending habits, deceptions, and lack of steady, gainful employment.  Under the\ncircumstances, Applicant should not be penalized for her good-faith attempts to save her home and\nher marriage.  I find she acted responsibly under the circumstances.  She sought counseling, but the\ncounseling service indicated it could not help her.  She used her bankruptcy petitions at the urging\nof her husband, and since her divorce, she has her finances under control, and is making payments\n\n7\nto  her creditors.  I find that these are good-faith efforts to repay creditors or otherwise resolve her\nindebtedness.  Most compelling is the statement from her ex-husband assuming responsibility for\nthe debts and admitting lack of steady employment.  He was also financially irresponsible, both\ncircumstances beyond her control.  In view of her husbands admissions that his sporadic employment\nand deceptive behavior were the chief causes of their financial problems, I find that applicant his\nmitigated the adverse inferences arising from the financial considerations guideline.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant has made progress resolving her debts.  She has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  I considered her age (40), her education, her employment, and the circumstances\nthat led to financial problems.  The irresponsible acts of her former spouse are not attributable to her.\nOnly after learning of his deceitful conduct about finances did she finally act to remove herself and\nher children from an unfortunate situation.  Applicant is not a security risk.  The totality of the record\nraises no reasonable or persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information\nand to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its interests.  I conclude it is a clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue Applicant=s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Since\nimmigrating to the U.S., Applicant has become a naturalized U.S. citizen, and established himself\nas a reliable and trusted production machinist with a U.S. defense contractor.  Applicant\u2019s birth\nparents and two sisters are citizens of Ecuador, reside in Ecuador, and are demonstrably close to\nApplicant.   None of his immediate family members remain in a position that could realistically\nmake them vulnerable to coercion or pressure that could implicate Applicant and compel him to\nmake decisions about competing loyalties.  Applicant mitigates potential risks to undue foreign\ninfluence concerns caused by the status of his parents and siblings being citizens and residents of\nEcuador.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 12, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 24, 2007.  A hearing was\nconvened on July 24, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At\nhearing, the Government's case consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses\n(including himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 3, 2007.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of five documents:\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs,  Background Note: Equador\n(January 2007), U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet\non Ecuador (June12,2006);  Excerpt from, U.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator of\nCounterterrorism, Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2-Country Reports: Western Hemisphere\nOverview (April 30, 2007);  U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and\nLabor, Ecuador: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006 (March 6, 2007); and  U.S.\nDepartment of Defense, Defense Security Service Training Office, Recent Espionage Cases:\nSummaries and Sources (July 1997). \nFor good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named\nbackground reports addressing the geopolitical situation in Ecuador.  Administrative notice was\nextended to the documents themselves in accordance with the provisions of Rule 201 of F.R. Evi.\nAdministrative notice was accorded the documents themselves, but the notice did not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing Ecuador\u2019s current state.  \n\n3\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAt the outset of the hearing, Department Counsel requested leave to strike sub-paragraphs\n1.d and 1.e of the SOR.  There being no objections, and good cause being demonstrated, Department\nCounsel\u2019s request was granted.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have a father (who currently serves in the\nEcuadorian Army with the rank of Sub-officer first), mother and two sisters who are citizens and\nresidents of Ecuador, (b) to have a friend who is a citizen of Venezuela and resides in the U.S., and\n(c) to have traveled to Mexico in 2005.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the\nallegations in the SOR without any explanation.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 34-year old production machinist for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant is married with two adopted children (ages and 7).  His wife and children are U.S.\ncitizens by birth.  After completing three years of college in Ecuador, Applicant emigrated from his\nbirth country Ecuador to the U.S. in February 2000 following his marriage in February 1999 to his\ncurrent spouse (see ex. A; R.T., at 46-47, 52-53).  Upon establishing residency in the U.S., he\nimmediately applied for U.S. citizenship.  He was granted U.S. citizenship in April 2005, and was\ngiven an interim clearance with his current employer the same month.\nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are citizens and residents of Ecuador (see ex. 2).  His father\nserves in the Ecuadoran Military Academy as a supervisor with the rank of sub-officer first (R.T.,\nat 32-35, 55)  His mother is a homemaker (R.T., at 34, 54). Applicant regularly stays in touch with\nhis parents.  His contacts vary from weekly to monthly, but mostly bi-weekly (R.T., at 34).\nApplicant\u2019s parents are in good shape financially and receive no financial assistance from him.\nApplicant\u2019s father (age 54) is a member of his Army volleyball team and has no Ecuadoran security\nclearance (R.T., at 35, 55).  The father expects to retire soon and is eligible to receive both retirement\nand medical benefits (R.T., at 56).  While Applicant\u2019s parents are generally aware of the former\u2019s\nemployment by his current defense contractor and his work on missiles, they are not aware of any\nof the specifics of his work or that possesses a security clearance (R.T., at 57).  \nBesides a brother who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has two sisters who are citizens\nand residents of Ecuador (ex. 2).  One sister is married and a homemaker; her husband works in the\ntransportation sector.  This sister has never been in the U.S.  Applicant speaks to twice a year and\nhas e-mailed her on a couple of occasions (R.T., at 58).  \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s other sister is a college student majoring in mathematics.  She, too, has never\ntraveled to the U.S., and is unmarried.  Applicant and this sister exchange e-mails several times a\nyear (R.T., at 59).\nApplicant traveled to Ecuador on one occasion since immigrating to the U.S. in 2000.  He\ntraveled to Ecuador in 2004 on his Ecuadoran passport, which has since expired (R.T., at 59-60).\nBoth his wife and children accompanied him on this trip to Ecuador, using their U.S. passports (see\nex. C; R.T., at 62-63).  He has sent money to both sisters on a couple of occasions.  His remittances\nvary in amounts, ranging from $60.00 to $150.00 (R.T., at 67-68)).  Applicant has since applied for\na U.S. passport and awaits a State Department response (R.T., at 60).  Neither Applicant nor any of\nhis U.S. based family members have traveled to Ecuador since their last trip in 2004, and they have\nno current intentions to do so in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s wife applied for Ecuadoran citizenship in 1999 and was granted her citizenship.\nShe has never applied for or received an Ecuadoran passport (R.T., at 64-65).  Applicant\u2019s parents\nplan to visit Applicant in Summer 2007, following the father\u2019s retirement from the Ecuadoran\nmilitary (R.T., at 65-66).\nApplicant has no intent to return to Ecuador to live and has no reason to believe any family\nmember in Ecuador is at risk to pressure, coercion, or compromise (R.T., at 68). Among his U.S.\nlocated assets is his established 401(k) retirement account with a reputable U.S. investment firm (see\nex. C).   Neither he nor his wife have any assets in Ecuador (R.T., at 51).\nApplicant regularly attends church with his local friends (R.T., at 73-75).  He is credited by\none friend, with whom he has attended church with over the past two years, with exceptional\ncharacter and willingness to assist others (R.T., at 74).\nEcuador\u2019s country status\nEcuador is a constitutional republic with a population of 13.5 million (see U.S. Department\nof State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Ecuador: Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices-2006, at p. 1  (March 6, 2007)).  The government is democratically elected and\nincludes a president with 15 cabinet ministers, a unicameral legislature, and a court system that\nincludes a supreme court and provincial courts (see State Department Background Note: Ecuador,\npps. 1-4 (March 2007)).  Ecuador\u2019s political parties have historically been small, loose organizations\nthat depend more on populist, charismatic leaders to retain support than on programs or ideology (see\nid., at p. 4).  Of political interest, none of the last three democratically elected presidents finished\ntheir terms because of political instability.  Ecuador\u2019s most recent president (Rafael Correa), running\non  an anti-establishment reform platform bested his opponent (Gustavo Noboa) in a second round\npresidential runoff in November 2006 that is generally considered to have been free, fair and\ntransparent by election observers (see id., at p. 3).  Correa was sworn in as Ecuador\u2019s new present\nin January 2007 (id.)  \nBy Latin America standards, Ecuador has a fairly decent  record for respecting human rights\n(see State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Ecuador-2006, pps. 2-15\n(March 2007)).  Ecuador\u2019s constitution bars torture and similar forms of intimidation and\npunishment, as well as arbitrary arrest and detention.  Its constitution also provides for an\n\n5\nindependent judiciary.  And the country\u2019s laws prohibit incommunicado detention (see id.; R.T., at\n42).  Still, human rights organizations report incidents of police torture and other cruel, inhumane,\nor degrading treatment or punishment. Criminal kidnaping for profit has continued to be a problem\nin certain regions of the country, and there have reported cases of arbitrary arrest and detention.\nPolitical and economic pressures and corruption in the national police and the courts have also been\nreported and remain a source of continuing U.S. concern.  These reports cover specifically cited\ninstances of human right deprivations, including improper conduct by security forces, criminal\nactivity in the National Police, corruption, and due process denials in the courts (see id).\nEcuador has a mixed record, too, on its historical protection of foreign property rights.  Twice\nin the last half-century, it has nationalized the property of U.S. firms.  In 1970, it nationalized the\nlocal interests of an ITT subsidiary, and more recently (in May 2006), it seized the assets of\nOccidental Petroleum (at the time the country\u2019s largest U.S. investor).  Ecuador, though, has\nhistorically been a party to bilateral investment treaties with the U.S. that include dispute\nmechanisms for resolving commercial disputes through international arbitration.  With its acceptance\nof arbitration of the Occidental case, Ecuador exhibits its sustaining commitment to the rule of\ncontract, a formative prerequisite for continuing investment partnering with U.S. firms (see\nBackground Note: Ecuador, supra, at pps. 4-5). \n       \nFor many years, the U.S. and Ecuador have maintained close ties based on a shared interest\nin maintaining democratic institutions, combating narco-trafficking, building trade, investment and\nfinancial relationships, cooperating in fostering Ecuador\u2019s economic development, and participating\nin inter-American organizations.  Ecuador stresses its multilateral approaches to resolving\nhemispheric and international issues and is a member of both the United Nations and the\nOrganization of American States (OAS), along with such regional groups as the Rio Group, the Latin\nAmerican Economic System, the Latin American Energy Organization, and the Andean Pact (see\nBackground Note: Ecuador, id, at pps. 5-6; R.T., at 37-38). \nDespite its strong regional standing in the Americas, Ecuador has experienced major border\ndisputes with two of its neighbors over the past century.  A border dispute with Peru spanned over\n50 years (1942 to 1997) and occasionally entailed armed hostilities between the two countries (see\nBackground Note: Ecuador, id, at pps. 5-6).  A significant espionage case arose out of this border\ndispute that enveloped U.S. intelligence interests.  These issues have subsided, however, and appear\nto have  resolved themselves.\nOf more pressing security concern to Ecuador is its ongoing border conflict with Colombia\nalong its 450-mile-long northern border.  This conflict involves counter terrorism and security threats\nfrom Colombian foreign terrorist organizations, frequently lined with narcotics trafficking\norganizations, along its northern border (see Excerpt from U.S. Department of State, Office of the\nCoordinator of Counter terrorism, Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2-Country Reports:\nWestern Hemisphere Overview, at p.6 (April 2007)).   Members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces\nof Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were  reported to be widely present\non the Colombia side of the border and regularly entered Ecuadorian territory (generally as unarmed\ncivilians) for rest and resupply.  See id. \nBorder instability attributable to frequent encroachment by Colombian guerillas into\nEcuadorian territory has prompted Ecuador\u2019s army to deploy more troops to the  region (see\n\n6\nBackground Note: Ecuador, supra, at p 5).  Although Ecuadorian officials have publicly deplored\nColombian guerilla activity and amassed armed forces along the border to interdict guerilla bands\nfrom Colombia, encroaching guerillas have been known to extort and intimidate local populations,\nand raises some security concerns for U.S. citizens residing in Ecuador (id).  For the record, some\n10 U.S. citizens have been kidnaped near Ecuador\u2019s border with Colombia since 1998 (see U.S.\nDepartment of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet on Ecuador, at p.2\n(June12,2006)..  One of these kidnaped victims was reportedly murdered by the kidnappers holding\nhim for ransom (see id.) \nEcuador has continued to work closely with the U.S. and other donors, though, to promote\nlawful economic activity and development in the north, and Ecuador\u2019s Congress has ratified the\nInter-American Convention against Terrorism (see Excerpt from U.S. Department of State, Office\nof the Coordinator of Counter terrorism, Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2-Country\nReports: Western Hemisphere Overview, supra, at p. 6; R.T., at 38-40).  All in all, Ecuador remains\na friendly country with democratic institutions and strong inter-governmental relations with the U.S.\nHistorically, the country has shown little inclination to coerce or pressure U.S. citizens to provide\nclassified or proprietary data, or in any way attempt to compromise sensitive and classified US.\nInformation.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered\nthe identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nBurden of Proof\n\n7\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so\nis clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges\nto make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or\nher security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant was born in Ecuador to parents of Ecuadoran descent and immigrated to the U.S.\nin 2000.  He became U.S. citizen in 2005, and is a highly regarded production machinist for a U.S.\ndefense contractor.  Security issues of concern to the Government focus on members of Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family (his birth parents and two sisters) who are citizens and residents of Ecuador,  a\ncountry not historically unfriendly to the U.S., but one with reported instances of human rights\nabuses, destabilizing border disputes, and occasional  engagement  in economic data collection in\nthe U.S. \nGovernment urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s immediate family members\nthat are citizens and residents of Ecuador might be subject to undue foreign influence by Ecuadorian\nauthorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because\nApplicant\u2019s birth father (who currently serves in the Ecuadorian Army with the rank of sub-officer\nfirst), birth mother, and two siblings are citizens of and reside in Ecuador, they present potential\nsecurity risks covered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion) of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members residing in\nEcuador pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence\nthat could compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control.  DC 7(b)\n(connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\n\n8\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information) has\npossible application due to the  presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in Ecuador, and\nhis father\u2019s current service in the Ecuadorian Army.  \nFrom what is known from the accounts of Applicant, neither Applicant nor his parents and\nsiblings have any (a) current financial or political affiliations with the Ecuadorian government, (b)\nhistory of being subjected to any coercion or influence, or \u00a9) apparent exposure to coercion or\ninfluence.  While it is not clear whether his father\u2019s service in the Ecuadorian Army has been as an\nofficer or enlistee, his rank and participation on the Ecuadorian volleyball team does not suggest any\nmilitary or political connections that could afford him any kind of special access and connections\nwith high level Ecuadorian political, intelligence, or military officials.\nMitigation is certainly present based on the presented record.  Both Applicant\u2019s relationships\nwith his family members and political conditions on the ground in Ecuador suggest no heightened\nrisks of compromise that could put Applicant\u2019s relationships with his immediate family members\nat risk to a potential hostage situation.  Ecuador\u2019s political and security conditions, while problematic\nat times, considering the reports of its recurrent border disputes, data collection activities, and\nhuman rights deprivations, remain essentially stable.  Security risks extant due to Applicant\u2019s having\nimmediate family members who are citizens and residents of Ecuador remain manageable ones. \nApplicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC 8(a) (the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.).\nEcuador is a country that in the past has targeted the U.S. for economic and proprietary data\ncollection, but is a country with a long history of democratic institutions and constitutional\nprotections of personal and property rights.  While there have been reports of human rights violations\nby the security forces and national police, nationalization of U.S. property interests, and destabilizing\nborder disputes with Peru and Colombia, Ecuador\u2019s public institutions and jurisprudential\ndevelopment  has generally reflected a basic respect for the rule of law by most published accounts.\nEcuador still continues to maintain strong diplomatic interests with the U.S., and has shown its\ndisposition to participate in multilateral institutions that include the U.S. and its hemispheric partners\nand friends, and to be helpful in strategic efforts to promote security and development in the\nAmericas. \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances still do not dictate per\nse results or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in general.  But they do place major emphasis on the status of the foreign country\nof concern. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family\nmembers in Ecuador, security risks of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the\nhopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant is\nremote at present, given the demonstrated track records of Applicant and his family members and\nthe status of Ecuador as a constitutional democracy. \n\n9\nOverall, considering both the guidelines and whole person assessment of Applicant in\njuxtaposition to one another, potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's immediate family\nmembers (viz., his birth parents and sisters) are sufficiently mitigated at this time to satisfy minimum\nrequirements for security clearance.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by Guideline B.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nfactors enumerated in E2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT,\nCONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS and CONDITIONS listed above, I make the following separate\nFORMAL FINDINGS with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.

Clearance is granted. \n\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated April 9, 2007.\n1\nGE. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated February 23, 2004).\n2\nId. at 2.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 23, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On April 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense, effective September 1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2007. I scheduled a hearing\nfor July 9, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on July 9, 2007 to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Five\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted.  Applicant's exhibits (AE A-L) were admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant and one witness (a union\nrepresentative at the company where Applicant works) on Applicant's behalf, as reflected in the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) received on July 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, \u00b6 \u00b61.k, and1.r, are incorporated herein.\nHe denied all other allegations under paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 because he disputed the accounts.1\nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 70-years old and works for a defense contractor. His first marriage ended in\ndivorce in 1977. He remarried and was widowed twice. His second wife died in 1983 and his third\nwife died of cancer in 1998. He is currently remarried. He is the father of seven children.  He held\n2\na security clearance for many years without incident in the military, law enforcement, and\ngovernment. Applicant earned a high school diploma and graduated from a community college in\n1969.3\n\n Id. \n4\nTr. 73, 74.\n5\nTr. 85.\n6\nAE C (Personal Statement, dated May 3, 2007).\n7\nAt that time, Applicant and his wife resided in Colorado. See C.R.S. 13-80-101.\n8\nGE 1 supra at note 2.\n9\n4\nWhile in high school, Applicant joined the United States Army National Guard. He served\nin the United States Navy as a combat medic for four years, and was honorably discharged in 1963.\nHe has been employed in his current position since February 23, 2004.  \n4\nApplicant worked his entire life and takes pride in his achievements despite various\nchallenges. His father died when he was seven years of age and he helped his mother take care of the\nfamily. He worked in construction and police services. After serving as a patrol man for many years,\nhe became a Jail Administrator, and ultimately, a Chief Deputy. After 25 years in that department,\nhe retired in 2001.  \n5\nDuring that time he supported his family and children. As noted above, his third wife died\nof cancer. When she was ill, she opened several credit accounts in her name. Near the end of her life,\nshe used them for fun things.  Applicant bought and paid for insurance premiums to cover the credit\n6\naccounts. When his wife died in 1998, he presented the cancelled check to the three creditors.\nHowever, the insurance company did not honor the coverage. The creditors did not obtain a\njudgment against Applicant.  These debts are not legally enforceable because of the applicability of\n7\nthe 3-year Colorado statute of limitations to such debts.8\nWhen Applicant retired from his law enforcement work in 2001, his financial status was\nsound and he had no outstanding indebtedness. He was 64 years old. He was unemployed for a\nperiod of time in 2000 and then decided to return to work part time.  In 2002, he worked part-time\nat the base where he is currently employed full time. He was also unemployed for a period of time\nin 2003.9\nApplicant completed a security clearance application on February 23, 2004. He received an\ninterim clearance. At that time he had no financial issues or medical debt. He answered  \"no\" to\nquestion 38: Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\nAt the time of the February 2004 application, Applicant's medical bills did not exist. When\nhe subsequently reviewed, signed and dated his SF 86 in 2005, his answer to the question did not\nchange. He answered the question \"no\" because he either did not owe the medical debts or had no\nknowledge of the debts. He did not deceive the government in any updated security applications. He\ndid not list his deceased wife's 1998 credit card debt for three reasons. First, Applicant paid\ninsurance premiums on those accounts so that they would be paid if his wife died. The insurance\ncompany  did not honor the policy. Applicant provided the cancelled check to the insurance company\n\nApplicant's response to SOR, dated May 3, 2007.\n10\nTr. 56-58.\n11\nPersonal Statement, dated May 3, 2007.\n12\nTr.78.\n13\nId.\n14\nTr. 36.\n15\n5\nto the credit companies. They did not take Applicant to court to obtain a judgment. It was almost ten\nyears ago and he did not consider them debts. Second, he had forgotten about them by this time.10\nIn September 2005, at the age of 68, Applicant had a major heart attack. He was life-flighted\nto a hospital and three stints were inserted. He returned home about three weeks later to recover. In\nOctober 2005, he had open heart surgery. He had a relapse while recovering at home and returned\nto the hospital.  He incurred many medical and hospital bills.  His health insurance from his\nemployer did not cover all the medical bills.  However, he also had Social Security/Medicare\n11\ncoverage from the age of 64.12\nIn 2007, during his security clearance investigation, Applicant learned about the medical\ndebts that had not yet been paid. Since he had not received notices from any of the providers, he did\nnot know the status of the medical debts. He responded to the investigation by researching the debts.\nHe obtained a credit report and he made numerous calls to locate the unknown medical accounts. He\ncalled his insurance company and learned that a portion of the medical bills had not been sent to\nMedicare. Repeatedly, he called Medicare to learn why the medical bills have not been paid. He\nasked for documentation (an amortization sheet) for the hearing but he did not receive any from\nMedicare. In fact, he reported that after holding for more than one hour, at some point, the customer\nservice representative hung up on him in frustration.  He called a hospital that was on the SOR to\n13\nlearn that he had never been in that hospital. However, he called another hospital by the same name\nin another state and found out that he did not owe $4,563 but instead owed $270. He also found\n14\nother errors in the SOR allegations when he researched his credit history.  When Applicant learned\n15\nhe was responsible for a debt, he paid it. \nThe current status of Applicant's alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCBR Group/medical      $294\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 53; AE K\n1.b\nPublic Works                  $63\nNo balance due\nTr. 61; AE K\n1.c\nPhysician's Service/NCO       \n   *$4563 ($270)\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTR. 72\n\n6\n1.d\nUnknown medical account\n$118\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 60; AE K\n1.e\nUnknown medical account\n$355\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 61; AE K\n1.f\nUnknown medical account\n$229\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 62; AE K\n1.g\nPhysician's Bill               $50\nPaid\nAE D Receipt dated 2006\n1.h\nUnknown medical          \n$395\nPaid $300/\nawaiting medicare\nTr. 63; AE K\n1.i\nUnknown medical         $295\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 63; AE K\n1.j\nUnknown medical         $200\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 63; AE K\n1.k\nPhysician's Bill              $90\nPaid\nAE G Receipt dated 4-20-07\n1.l\nUnknown medical         $346\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 65; AE K\n1.m\nUnknown medical       $504\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 64; AE K\n1.n\nUnknown medical       $158\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nAE K\n1.o\nCredit card                   $2475\nDeceased wife's\naccount/ paid\ncredit insurance\n Tr. 57; AE K; (1998) Statute\nof Limitations\n1.p\nCredit card                   $3732\nDeceased wife's\naccount/paid credit\ninsurance\nTr. 57; AE K;  (1998)Statute\nof Limitations\n1.q\nCredit card                   $2826\nDeceased wife's\naccount/paid credit\ninsurance\nTr. 57; AE K;  (1998) Statute\nof Limitations\n1.r\nHospital bill                $1091\nIncorrect amount\nPaid $117.69  May4, 2007\n1.s\nMedical account          $318\nAwaiting medicare\nresponse\nTr. 68; AE K\n1.t\nMedical account          $102\nPaid\nAE  E Receipt \nApplicant is highly recommended by his employer.

He did receive a raise, but his gas, food and\nmedical insurance bills have increased. He does not have a mortgage. He is now current on his car\nloan.  His credit rating is steadily improving.  He is financially stable. His only debts are the medical\n20\nbills. He accepts responsibility for incurring those debts, but is awaiting a response from Medicare.\nHis wife's credit card bills are ten years old, the statute of limitations has run, he did not incur these\ndebts, and they are no longer legally enforceable.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n21\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n22\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n23\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The government\n21\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n22\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n23\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n24\ndecision.25\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n26\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n27\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n28\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n29\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.30\n\n\"Even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his\n31\nor her control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with\nthose financial difficulties.\" ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4\n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \"good faith\" effort to repay overdue creditors\n32\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an\napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. T he\n9\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued medical\ndebts from 2005 that are still outstanding debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC\nDC, \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Several incidents occurred\nin Applicant' s life over which he had no control. Such incidents contributed to Applicant's acquisition\nof delinquent debt. His wife's credit card debts were insured but the insurance company refused to\npay. His 2005 heart attack and subsequent surgery resulted in medical bills. His primary insurance\ncompany paid and he awaits a response from Medicare. He paid his debts after  he learned about them\nand researched all options. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. \nThe medical bills stem from the 2005 heart attack. The bills are still not resolved. Therefore,\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC), \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) partially\napplies.\nApplicant has not received financial counseling. However, he never ignored his creditors. He\ndid not know that the medical bills were not paid. He had not received notices before the 2007\nsecurity investigation. There are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol. He is working diligently to discover whether Medicare will pay. FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control) does apply to some extent.31\nIn  his entire life Applicant had no financial difficulties. Since his 2005 medical emergency,\nhe incurred medical debt. His employer's insurance paid and thereafter Applicant paid any bill that\nhe was aware of. He has diligently called Medicare and is trying to resolve his medical debt. He has\nsince paid the bills that Medicare declined to pay. While the statute of limitations unequivocally\nresolves his debts, he does not receive full credit under this mitigating condition.  Therefore, FC MC,\n\u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) applies in part.32\n\nD irective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 H owever, the B oard has indicated that\nthe co ncept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows\nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly,\nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available\noption (such as b ankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating\ncondition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISC R C ase N o. 02-30304 at 3 (A pp. B d . Apr. 20, 2004 )\n(quoting ISCR Case N o. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. B d. June 4, 2001)). \nAG \u00b6 15.\n33\n10\nFC MC, AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply. Applicant has\nno documentation concerning his communication with medicare. However, he is credible in his\ntestimony concerning his oral communications. Nor does he have the cancelled check he presented\nto creditors in 1998.\nThe issue is whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his outstanding debts, and\nwhether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances to\nwarrant a favorable security clearance decision. His remaining unpaid medical debt does not\nconstitute a security risk. His wife's credit card debt is more than ten years old. The statue of\nlimitations applies. He is not in a vulnerable position due to those accounts that were in her name.\nMoreover, he paid insurance premiums for the credit accounts but the company did not honor the\nplan. He has a professional position with a good income and has no other delinquent debt.\nPersonal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.33\nOn February 23, 2004, Applicant, in response to Question 38: Your Financial Delinquencies\n- 180 Days answered \"no\". When he responded to the question on his security application in 2004\nhe answered truthfully. He had no medical bills as his heart attack had not yet occurred. When he\nsigned subsequent security documentation, he had no knowledge of the unpaid medical bills. Some\nof the bills listed on the SOR were in fact incorrect and Applicant did not owe them. As for his wife's\ncredit card accounts, he believed they were not valid debts because he had paid insurance premiums\nand the creditors did not take him to court to pursue a judgment. He was honest and credible in his\naccount. Moreover, the accounts were so old that the Statute of Limitations applied. I find that he did\nnot intend to deceive the Government, but answered truthfully to the best of his knowledge. The\nGovernment did not prove that he intentionally falsified his security clearance application. I find in\nfavor of Applicant.\nWhole Person\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n34\n11\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, mature man who served his country. He maintained a security clearance for many years\nwithout adverse incident. He is currently in a professional position in the defense contractor industry.\nHe persevered to complete his education and support his family through the hard times of medical\nemergencies and death. During his entire working life, he had no financial difficulties until his\nmedical emergency in 2005.He provided information to his health care providers about his medical\ninsurance. His testimony at the hearing was candid and straightforward. At the hearing he\nacknowledged his deceased wife's credit card debt could be considered a negative. He is open, honest\nand has not hidden his situation. He is handling his medical debt properly. This is a reasonable way\nto resolve the debts. He has not incurred any other delinquent debt. His financial circumstances have\nimproved. He has worked diligently to research his credit history and repair the damage that occurred\nfrom his medical situation. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low. He is\ncurrent on his financial obligations, and has a very positive employment history.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low. Applicant continues to contact Medicare\nand is awaiting a response. He is not legally required to pay his wife's creditors because of the state\nstatute of limitations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns\npertaining to financial considerations.\nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial\nvalue of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in\nthat they stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by\ngiving security and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy\nconsideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law\nto promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of\nlimitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set\nperiod of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on\ntheir rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial\nsystem.\n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552\n(S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nSubstantial evidence supports Applicant's trustworthiness eligibility and suitability. I take\nthis position based on the law, my \"careful consideration of the whole person factors\"  and\n34\nsupporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess and my interpretation of my responsibilities. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant\nis eligible for his security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n12\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s accrual of $62,000 of delinquent debt and his failure to disclose it on his\nsecurity clearance application creates security concerns that he failed to mitigate at the hearing.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on August 31, 2007, and requested a hearing.\n\nSee generally, Exhibits A through E.\n1\nExhibit B, 2006 Performance Evaluation.\n2\nExhibit I.\n3\nExhibit L.\n4\nTr. 42, 70.\n5\nExhibit 3 at 3.\n6\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on October 4, 2007. That day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing\nscheduling it for October 23, 2007. During the hearing, I received six government exhibits, 15\nApplicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on October 31, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h,\n1.m, 2.c, and 2.d), into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old man with three children, ages 14, 10, and 8 from a marriage that\nended in divorce in 2004. He has physical custody of them. He is a U.S. Air Force veteran, serving\nfrom 1975 through his honorable discharge in 1978. He received a bachelor of science degree in\nbusiness management in 1984. Since 2002, he has worked as a subcontract administrator for an\naeronautical company.1\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s employer, he is \u201ca competent performer and valued team player.\u201d2\nA coworker described him as a man with high ethical standards and moral convictions.3\nApplicant is also highly respected in his community. He is a youth league basketball coach\nwho is considered a father figure by many of his players.4\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after the birth of his first child in 1993 when his wife\nstopped working full time. Beginning in 1995, he attempted to compensate for the decreased income\nby claiming more federal income tax deductions.  His paychecks increased, but he was unable to pay\n5\nthe increased income tax debt when due. He was also unable to pay his income taxes for the tax years\n1996 and 1997.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were exacerbated when his wife stopped working entirely in\n1999. In March 2000, they filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.  In 2001, Applicant was laid\n6\noff from work, and was unemployed for the next 14 months. Although he sought to lessen the impact\nof the unemployment by working at a variety of odd jobs, he began to get \u201cfurther and further into\n\nTr. 31.\n7\nId.\n8\nExhibit M at 19.\n9\nTr. 50.\n10\nAnswer at 7.\n11\nTr. 37.\n12\nTr. 67.\n13\nLetter from Creditor to Applicant, dated July 31, 2007, as listed in Answer at 7.\n14\nTr. 55.\n15\nTr. 78.\n16\n3\ndebt.\u201d  In August 2003, the bankruptcy petition was dismissed because they failed to make payments,\n7\nas the bankruptcy plan required.8\nIn November 2002, Applicant began working for his current employer. Ten months later, he\nand his wife separated. Their divorce was finalized in September 2004.9\nCurrently, Applicant owes approximately $62,000 of delinquent, unpaid debt. Approximately\n$18,700 comprises federal income tax debt for tax years 1995 through 1997 (SOR subparagraph 1.a).\nA lien in this amount was entered against his property in 2005. The remaining delinquencies include\nfour utilities (SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, and 1.j), the deficiency owed on a 2004 car\nrepossession (SOR subparagraph 1.l), five credit cards (SOR subparagraphs 1.d through 1.g, and 1.i),\nand two bank loans.10\nApplicant disputed the delinquencies listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.d, 1.g, and 1.i. He\nprovided no evidence that he either notified or attempted to locate the corresponding creditors.\nIn February 2007, Applicant entered an installment agreement to satisfy his tax debt listed\nin SOR subparagraph 1.a.  It is unclear from the record, how much he has satisfied thus far.  He had\n11\nentered an installment agreement in 2003, but could not adhere to it.  He anticipates that he will\n12\nsuccessfully execute the new plan because his ex-wife is contributing. She did not help him with the\nfirst installment plan.13\nIn July 2007, Applicant satisfied SOR subparagraph 1.j.  He has made no progress toward\n14\nthe satisfaction of the remaining delinquencies. He has not enrolled in credit counseling.\nApplicant did not disclose either the 2004 car repossession, the 2005 income tax lien, or any\nof his other outstanding delinquencies on his September 2005 security clearance application, as\nrequired in response to Sections 27 and 28. He omitted this information because he was \u201cscared,\u201d15\nand did not want to lose his job.16\nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n17\n4\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n17\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems trigger the application of\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,\u201d FC DC 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and FC DC 19(e),\n\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by irresponsible spending. Instead, they\nbegan when his wife stopped working full-time after the birth of their first child, worsened after his\nlengthy unemployment, and grew out of control after their divorce. Through the years, Applicant has\nmade sincere, but unsuccessful efforts at reducing his delinquencies. Currently, he is paying his\n\nDISCR OSD No. 89-1586 (App. Bd., October 26, 1990).\n18\n5\nincome tax delinquencies through a payment plan. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\n(FC MC) 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d and\nFC MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s income tax delinquencies compose less than one third of his delinquencies, and\nhe has neither organized a plan to satisfy the remainder nor sought counseling to assist him. Also,\nalthough he is making payments through an income tax payment plan, he did not establish how much\nhe has satisfied. Moreover, he failed to complete an earlier tax payment plan in 2003, in addition to\na Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2000. Consequently, FC MC 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d is inapplicable.\nApplicant\u2019s three disputed delinquencies equal approximately $1,000. He provided no\nevidence that he either notified the respective creditors of the disputes or attempted to locate the\ndisputed creditors. FC MC 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d does not apply.\nUpon weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation continues to pose a security risk.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of relevant\nfinancial information from his security clearance application triggers the application of Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Lying to the\ngovernment in the belief that it is necessary to save one\u2019s job does not mitigate falsification.18\nApplicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\n\n6\nApplicant accrued his financial delinquencies through a series of unexpected circumstances\nrather than financial irresponsibility. Although he has sincerely tried to get his finances under\ncontrol, he has made minimal progress. I was impressed by his competence displayed on the job, and\nwith his role as a father figure to youth in his community. These positive attributes were offset by\nthe negative security implications of his decision to falsify the security clearance application.\nEvaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct concerns continue to create a security concern. Clearance is\ndenied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k - 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant is a 32-year-old married man with two stepchildren ages six and nine. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2001. He is a paramedic and a firefighter. He earned a paramedic certificate in 2002. Between approximately 2001 and 2007, Applicant accrued 18 delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $9,500. Fourteen are medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.n), one is a deficiency owed on a repossessed car (SOR subparagraph 1.o), and three are delinquent credit card accounts (SOR subparagraphs 1.p through 1.r). Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, who was covered under his health insurance when they were married, accrued the medical bills. The remainder were joint 1 debts he \u201cwas stuck with\u201d after the divorce was finalized. 2 Applicant satisfied subparagraph 1.q. There is no record evidence documenting when he 3 satisfied it.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s accrual of $9,500 in delinquent debt, and his failure to make a good-faith\neffort to satisfy or otherwise resolve them create a financial considerations security concern\nwhich he failed to mitigate. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\n\nItem 3.\n1\nId.\n2\nItem 5 at 2.\n3\nItem 6 at 3.\n4\n2\nanswered the SOR on August 6, 2007, admitting all of the allegations except subparagraphs 1.q\nthrough 1.s, and elected to have the case decided on the written record.\nOn August 30, 2007, the government submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM) which\nApplicant received on September 10, 2007. Applicant neither objected to any of the FORM\nsubmissions, nor submitted any supplementary documents. The case was assigned to me on\nNovember 2, 2007.\nRULING ON EVIDENCE\nDepartment counsel\u2019s motion to strike SOR subparagraph 1.s and SOR Paragraph 2 is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 32-year-old married man with two stepchildren ages six and nine. His first\nmarriage ended in divorce in 2001. He is a paramedic and a firefighter. He earned a paramedic\ncertificate in 2002.\nBetween approximately 2001 and 2007, Applicant accrued 18 delinquent debts in the\napproximate amount of $9,500. Fourteen are medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.n), one\nis a deficiency owed on a repossessed car (SOR subparagraph 1.o), and three are delinquent credit\ncard accounts (SOR subparagraphs 1.p through 1.r). Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, who was covered under\nhis health insurance when they were married, accrued the medical bills.  The remainder were joint\n1\ndebts he \u201cwas stuck with\u201d  after the divorce was finalized. \n2\nApplicant satisfied subparagraph 1.q.  There is no record evidence documenting when he\n3\nsatisfied it. His contention that he satisfied subparagraph 1.r is unsupported by any documentary\nevidence. He asserts that he has not been able to satisfy any other delinquencies because of \u201clack of\nmoney.\u201d  \n4\nApplicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.p and proposed a payment\nplan. The creditor rejected it. As of March 2007, he was considering filing for bankruptcy protection.\nTo date, he has not filed it. \nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n5\nAdjudicative Guideline Paragraph 18.\n6\n3\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n5\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d6\n\nInability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\n7\nA history of not meeting financial obligations.\n8\nConsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\n9\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n10\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a),  FC DC 19(c),  and FC DC 19(e).  I have considered all\n7\n8\n9\nof the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. All but one of the SOR delinquencies are still\noutstanding, he provided no evidence that he has attended any financial counseling, and he has yet\nto fulfill his promise to resolve the delinquencies through bankruptcy. He provided no documentary\nproof to support his dispute of SOR subparagraph 1.r. Although Financial Condition Mitigating\nCondition 20(b)  is potentially applicable because of the relationship of his delinquencies to his\n10\n2001 divorce, his failure to responsibly address them by satisfying or otherwise disposing of them\nrenders it inapplicable. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant accrued approximately $9,500 of delinquent debt between 2001 and 2007. Because\nhis ex-wife accrued much of it, its nature, extent, and seriousness are mitigated somewhat.\nApplicant, however, has taken no significant steps to address them. Absent any evidence of\nrehabilitation, the likelihood that his financial difficulties will continue remains unacceptably high.\nEvaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude he remains a security\nconcern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nWITHDRAWN\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nWITHDRAWN \nDECISION\n\n5\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with one young daughter. He was born in Lebanon, and first came to the United States with his parents when he was about four years old. His father was a commercial architect whose work was primarily in Lebanon, but the family came to the United States on permanent resident visas and spent most of each year here to avoid the dangers of the Lebanese civil war. They all became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1994. (Tr. at 41-45.) Applicant was schooled in both Lebanon and the U.S., receiving his high school diploma from a Lebanese school in June 1998. In September 1998, he moved permanently to the U.S. and began college. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2002, and his master\u2019s degree in December 2003, both in electrical engineering. He was hired by his present employer in January 2004, and was granted an interim security clearance, without incident, until it was suspended in connection with the present proceedings. He has subsequently earned an M.B.A. at company expense. (GE 1 at 2; AE A; Tr. at 59.) During a family visit to Lebanon in 1997, when Applicant was 17 years old, his parents were required by the Lebanese army to obtain a Lebanese passport for him in order to leave that country to return to the United States. Applicant used that passport to leave Lebanon on that occasion, but used only his U.S. passport thereafter. (Tr. at 36- 37, 56-58.) The Lebanese passport expired in 20",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was born in Lebanon, resided there part-time while a minor living with\nhis parents, formerly held a Lebanese passport, and voted there once in an non-\ngovernment election. In context, these actions did not demonstrate preference for a\nforeign country over the United States. Based upon thorough review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 18,\n2004. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJune 3, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 4, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on January 2, 2008, and again on February 27, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on\nFebruary 27, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 11, 2008,\nand DOHA assigned the case to me on March 13, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 17, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on March 27, 2008. On March 12, 2008, Applicant waived his right to 15\ndays notice via an email to Department Counsel, and confirmed that waiver during the\nhearing. (Tr. at 11-12.) The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 4, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with\none young daughter. He was born in Lebanon, and first came to the United States with\nhis parents when he was about four years old. His father was a commercial architect\nwhose work was primarily in Lebanon, but the family came to the United States on\npermanent resident visas and spent most of each year here to avoid the dangers of the\nLebanese civil war. They all became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1994. (Tr. at 41-45.)\nApplicant was schooled in both Lebanon and the U.S., receiving his high school\ndiploma from a Lebanese school in June 1998. In September 1998, he moved\npermanently to the U.S. and began college. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in June\n2002, and his master\u2019s degree in December 2003, both in electrical engineering. He\nwas hired by his present employer in January 2004, and was granted an interim security\nclearance, without incident, until it was suspended in connection with the present\nproceedings. He has subsequently earned an M.B.A. at company expense. (GE 1 at 2;\nAE A; Tr. at 59.)  \nDuring a family visit to Lebanon in 1997, when Applicant was 17 years old, his\nparents were required by the Lebanese army to obtain a Lebanese passport for him in\norder to leave that country to return to the United States. Applicant used that passport to\nleave Lebanon on that occasion, but used only his U.S. passport thereafter. (Tr. at 36-\n37, 56-58.) The Lebanese passport expired in 2002, and was destroyed in front of his\ncompany\u2019s security officer on March 30, 2007. (GE 2 at 15, 24.) Applicant admitted the\ntruth of SOR \u00b6 1.a, concerning this passport, with this explanation of the circumstances.\nApplicant also admitted the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, concerning his visits to\nLebanon, with explanations. As noted above, he lived intermittently in Lebanon and the\nU.S. while a minor, depending on where his parents were at the time. Shortly before his\n18  birthday, he moved to the U.S. full time in order to attend college. He visited\nth\nLebanon twice in 2000 to visit his grandmother while she was sick with terminal cancer.\nHe visited again in 2001 to see his mother who was still there in connection with caring\n\n3\nfor his grandmother. In 2004, he went to Lebanon to attend the wedding of a friend (who\nis now a U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.). In 2005 and 2006 he made brief visits to\nLebanon during trips that were primarily for his honeymoon and his brother\u2019s wedding in\nEurope. He properly reported his foreign travel to security personnel due to his interim\nclearance. He testified that he does not desire to return to Lebanon in the future, and\nhas no one left there that he considers family. His father is now retired. Although he has\none uncle and a few cousins still living in Lebanon, all of his immediate and close family\nmembers are U.S. citizens and residents. (Answer; AE B; GE 2 at 23; Tr. at 28, 30-32,\n38-41, 54-55, 58-59.)\nWhile Applicant was in Lebanon in 2005, he was asked to, and did, vote in an\nelection in a church he was attending in his family\u2019s former home town. The election\nwas for a church functionary, not a government official, and he was not required to be a\nLebanese citizen to cast the vote. He has voted in numerous U.S. elections, and has no\nintention of ever voting in any future Lebanese election. He did not vote in Lebanon in\n1998, and the SOR was amended to delete that portion of the SOR \u00b6 1.c allegation at\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request. (Answer; GE 3; Tr. at 38, 46-49, 67-68.) \nApplicant owns no property and has no financial assets in Lebanon. He and his\nwife own their home and two (soon to be three) other investment properties in the U.S.,\npurchased with his wife\u2019s family\u2019s assistance. He estimated his net worth here at\n$430,000. He is willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship, but is not sure how to do\nso. He has no military service obligation in Lebanon, and never served in their armed\nforces. (GE 2 at 10; Tr. at 39-40, 50-51, 59-62.)  His testimony during the hearing was\nforthright and credible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\n\n4\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9, security concerns involving foreign preference arise because,\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other\nsuch benefits from a foreign country;\n\n5\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business interests in\nanother country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate those security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\nApplicant did acquire a Lebanese passport in 1997, after becoming a U.S. citizen\nin 1994. However, he did so only because the Lebanese army required him to do so in\norder to leave Lebanon and return to the U.S. with his parents. That passport expired in\n2002, and was later destroyed in the presence of his company\u2019s security officer. All of\nhis subsequent travel has been done using his U.S. passport. He does not hold any\nforeign passport, and has not done so since 2002. Applicant attended school in\n\n6\nLebanon while he was a minor and resided part time in Lebanon with his parents. His\nresidence and all of his education since he turned 18, ten years ago, has been in the\nUnited States. His residence in Lebanon was not to meet citizenship requirements,\nsince he was born there. He has not served in a foreign military, and has no obligation\nto do so. His infrequent subsequent visits to Lebanon have been for family purposes,\nbut no close family remains there. He has no foreign business or financial interests, and\nnever sought or held foreign political office. He did vote once in Lebanon while visiting\nthere, but on balance the evidence shows that was not an act of citizenship. There is no\nevidence that he ever acted in the interests of any foreign person, group, organization\nor government, or made any statement or act showing allegiance to a foreign country. \nApplicant\u2019s former possession of a Lebanese passport, part-time residence and\neducation there as a child, and casual vote while visiting there in 2005 could raise\nsecurity concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), (3), (7) and 10(b) above. Under the circumstances\nof this case, his actions would support only the most minimal concerns under those\ncriteria. Balancing against those concerns would be the mitigating effect of AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a),\n(b), (c), and (e), all of which are firmly established in this record. Once he was old\nenough to live independent of his parents, he returned to the U.S. and has established\nhis entire life here, with only brief visits to Lebanon. His 2005 vote was not an exercise\nof his Lebanese citizenship, which he acquired at birth and is willing to renounce. His\nformer passport is both expired and destroyed. Applicant\u2019s allegiance is solely to the\nUnited States. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves minimal, if any, expression of preference for a foreign country. Most of\n\n7\nthe alleged concerns occurred when he was a minor and under his parent\u2019s direction.\nThe only recent conduct of potential concern involved a casual vote in an unofficial\nelection there in 2005 while he was attending church. This he freely disclosed, but it\nwas not an exercise of citizenship. It is unlikely that he will exercise any rights or\nprivileges of Lebanese citizenship since all but a few remote relatives, and all his\nbusiness and personal interests, are in the United States. He does not intend to even\nvisit Lebanon again, and has demonstrated compliance with the obligation to report\nforeign travel.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from his dual citizenship, old Lebanese\npassport, time spent in Lebanon, and 2005 vote there. Overall, the record evidence\nleaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns arising under Guideline C, and his actions do not indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 21, 2007, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on October 25, 2007.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\n\n2\nFORM on September 3, 2007, and he submitted a reply that was undated, but received\nby DOHA on December 3, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on December 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 41 years old and married.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a Field Engineering Technician, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted to illegal drug use involving multiple types of illegal drugs,\nbeginning in 1984 and continuing until July 1997.  (See Government Exhibit 7).   \nThe Applicant began using marijuana in 1984.  He smoked marijuana twice\nweekly from 1984 until July 1997.  He never purchased it because it was always given\nto him.  He smoked hashish on one occasion in 1990.  He used acid (LSD) in 1989, and\na few times through 1990.  (See Government Exhibit 7).  In his response to the FORM\nreceived by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals on December 3, 2007, the\nApplicant contradicts his earlier statement in Government Exhibit 7, and states that he\ndid not smoke marijuana twice a week from 1984 through July 1997. (See Applicant\u2019s\nReply to FORM).      \nThe Applicant also used cocaine.  He first used cocaine in 1993.  He snorted in\nquarterly from 1993 through 1994.  He paid between $80.00 to $100.00 per gram for the\ncocaine.  Besides marijuana, hashish, acid (LSD) and cocaine, the Applicant has not\nused any other illegal drug and has no future intentions of ever using any illegal drug.\nHe has never been arrested or counseled due to his illegal drug use.  (See Government\nExhibit 7).  \nFrom March 1985 through August 1988, and from December 1993 through\nNovember 1997, the Applicant possessed a security clearance while using illegal drugs.\n(See Government Exhibits 13 and 14).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant was arrested on the charge of misdemeanor Assault and Battery in\nJune 1996, and not Felony Domestic Assault as alleged in the SOR.  (See Government\nExhibit 15).   \nA year later, in June 1997, the Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol with a Blood Alcohol Content Above .08% in June 1997.  He and a\n\n3\nfriend spent the day in Tijuana, Mexico where they shopped and drank margaritas and\nshots of tequila.  The Applicant believes he had four or five drinks over several hours.\nHe returned to California, and made an illegal u-turn and was stopped by police.  He\nwas given the breathalyser and registered .08.  He pled guilty to Driving Under the\nInfluence and the charge of Alcohol with a Blood Alcohol Content Above .08% was\ndismissed.  He was sentenced to summary probation for three years, fined $1,500.00,\nrequired to complete a First Conviction Program and his license was suspended for 90\ndays.  He has satisfied all of the sentencing requirements imposed by the court and he\nhas not been arrested since then.    \nThe Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications in his security clearance application,\nthree sworn statements to the Defense Security Service and on his answers to\ninterrogatories, discussed below, are violations of Title 18 of the United States Code,\nSection 1001, a felony.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire dated September 21,\n1992.  Question 20(a) of the application asked the Applicant if he has ever tried or used\nor possessed any narcotic (to include heroin or cocaine), depressant (to include\nquaaludes), stimulant, Hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or Cannabis (to include\nMarijuana or Hashish), or any other mind-altering substances (to include glue or paint),\neven one time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed\nphysician?  The  Applicant answered, \u201cYES\u201d and listed that he smoked marijuana\noccasional/recreational use, and that his last use of marijuana was in February 1992.\nHe failed to list his use of marijuana, hashish, acid (LSD) and cocaine as set forth under\nGuideline H above.  (See Government Exhibit 11).        \n  \nIn a signed, sworn statement dated November 1993, before a Special Agent of\nthe Defense Security Service, the Applicant stated that he used marijuana about three\ntimes per year from 1985 to February 1989.  He failed to list that he had used marijuana\napproximately twice weekly from 1984 to at least July 1997.  (See Government Exhibit\n10).\nIn a signed, sworn statement dated June 10, 1997, before a Special Agent of the\nDefense Security Service, the Applicant denied using marijuana since 1992 and denied\never using any other illegal drug.  He failed to list his use of marijuana beyond 1992 and\nthat he had also used hashish, acid (LSD) and cocaine as set forth under Guideline H\nabove.  (See Government Exhibit 9).\nIn a signed, sworn statement dated September 2, 1997, before a Special Agent\nof the Defense Security Service, the Applicant denied using marijuana prior to 1989 and\nhe stated that his last use of marijuana was in 1992.  He also denied ever using any\nother illegal drug.  He failed to list his use of marijuana beyond 1992 and that he had\n\n4\nalso used hashish, acid (LSD) and cocaine as set forth under Guideline H above.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 8).\nIn his response to Interrogatories dated April 4, 2007, sent to the Applicant by the\nDepartment of Defense, the Applicant indicated in the Section entitled \u201cDrug Use: that\nhe used marijuana four times in January and February 1992 and ten times in July 1994\nthrough September 1996.  He failed to list his use of marijuana beyond 1996 and that\nhe had also used hashish, acid (LSD) and cocaine as set forth under Guideline H\nabove.  (See Government Exhibit 6).\nThe Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions dated\nJanuary 31, 2005 and resigned on August 29, 2005.  Question 21 of the application\nasked the Applicant if he has ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffenses.  The Applicant answered, \u2018NO\u201d.  His response is truthful and accurate.  He\nwas not charged with Felony Domestic Assault, as alleged by the Government in the\nSOR.  (See Government Exhibit 15).          \n  \nBased upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified\nhis National Agency Questionnaire dated September 21, 1992, his sworn statements to\nthe Defense Security Service dated November 9, 1993, his sworn statement dated June\n10, 1997, his sworn statement dated September 2, 1997, and his answers to his\ninterrogatories dated April 4, 2007.      \nA letter of recommendation submitted by the Senior Principle Field Engineer\nTechnician, who is a coworker and directly responsible for assigning the Applicant his\nduties, and who has known the Applicant for more than ten years, indicates that the\nApplicant is responsible and trustworthy and is a valuable asset to the company.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Response to the FORM). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern.  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n\n5\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n22.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse, criminal conduct and dishonesty that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H), criminal conduct (Guideline\nJ) and dishonesty (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J and E of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, disqualifying conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  However, mitigating condition\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.  Applicant\u2019s last use of\nany illegal drug, be it marijuana, hashish, acid (LSD) or cocaine last occurred in 1997,\nover ten years ago.  His last use of illegal drugs occurred so far in the distant past and\nthere is no evidence in the record to indicate otherwise.  I do not find his past use of\nillegal drugs to be recent or of security significance.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement.      \nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  Although the Applicant\u2019s arrests and charges by law enforcement last\noccurred in 1996 and 1997, over ten years ago, he has recently lied a number of times\n\n8\nabout the nature and extent of his illegal drug involvement on various Government\ndocuments, specifically by falsifying material facts in a National Agency Questionnaire,\nthree sworn statements, and in his response to interrogatories during the course of his\nbackground investigation.  By doing so, he committed violations of Title 18, United\nStates Code, Section 1001.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct is very troubling.  He\nhas not been honest with the Government in answering questions about his illegal drug\ninvolvement.  He deliberately tried to conceal the truth about his illegal drug use.  Even\nin his response to the FORM, he indicates that his previous statement, referring to\nGovernment Exhibit 7, concerning his drug use was not true.  So much inconsistency\nconfirms to the Government that the Applicant\u2019s credibility is a security concern.  There\nis no reasonable excuse as to why he did not tell the truth about his drug involvement,\nother than the fact that he wanted to minimize it.  It is obvious that he intentionally\nconcealed this information from the Government, hoping to minimize the seriousness of\nthe matter.  Consequently, his dishonesty with the Government concerning this matter is\nunacceptable.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  Under Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions 30(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 30(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of\nclearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his\npersonal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under\nGuidelines E or J apply. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \n This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\n\n9\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 4 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

To her credit she has developed no new debts and has\nmade consistent payments since the plan was approved in May 2007.  Special circumstances of poor\nhealth and unemployment mainly caused her debts which she was unable to resolve over a long\nperiod.

She also established she had no intent to falsify her security submission by her failure to\ndetail all of her debts as she documented them by submitting a credit report.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on April 27, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make\nthe preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial\n1\nConsiderations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 and over Personal Conduct (Guideline E) in paragraph\n2 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\n2\nthe Department of Defense, to be effective September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer dated June  1, 2007.\nShe requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on July 10, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to me on July 11, 2007. Subsequently, after a mutually convenient date for hearing was\nagreed to, a Notice of Hearing, issued on July 12, 2007, set the matter for August 2, 2007, at a\nlocation near where Applicant works and lives.\n \nAt the hearing the Government offered nine exhibits  (Exhibit 1-9), which were admitted\ninto evidence. Applicant testified. I granted Applicant two weeks until August 16, 2007, to submit\nadditional evidence and  the Government had until August 20, 2007, to review.  (TR 24)\nApplicant submitted her evidence on August 14, 2007. (Exhibit A) Department counsel responded\non August 15, 2007, that he had no objection.  The document was admitted into evidence and the\nrecord closed on August 15, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received on August 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      Applicant only listed two children in her security forms.  (Exhibit 1)\n3\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 44 years old, has worked for a defense contractor in State #1 from November\n2001 to present as a pipefitter. She completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in September 2005.  She had an interim\nclearance granted in August 2006; when the SOR was issued in April 2007 it was removed.  She\nwas unemployed from October 2000 to November 2001.  Previously, she worked from August\n1981 to October 2000 for an employer in State #2.  She is a high school graduate.  (Exhibits 1, 8;\nTR 6-7; 23; 31-32)\nApplicant married in 1981 and listed two children born in 1984 and 1988; she divorced in\nApril 1994.  Later she stated she was a single mother for seventeen years and raised three  kids.\n3\nOne child is in graduate school, but she is helping him financially.  She has another child that just\ngraduated from high school and is going to a community college in the fall.  Her other child lives\nindependently.  Their father has helped with school expenses and child support.  She married\nhusband #2 in February 2002 and separated in June 2004.  (Exhibit 1; TR 21; 29-30; 49-50)\nFinances and Personal Conduct\nIn response to questions on her financial record in Section 27 she disclosed financial issues\nwith a 2005 car loan where she planned to set up payment arrangements and a 2001 car loan where\nshe had co-signed and owed $9,526 that was unsatisfied.  In response to Section 28 on her\nfinancial delinquencies, she answered \u201cyes\u201d she had been over 180 days delinquent on debts, but\nprovided information solely about a 1998 debt for $300 to American Credit Education.  She\ncertified that her answers were true, complete and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.\n (Exhibit 1)  \nWhen confronted with the inconsistency between her large number of debts and her failure\nto detail them in the form, she admitted she was rushed when she completed the security\npaperwork.  However, Applicant declared she had provided a current 2005 credit bureau report\nalong with the security form in order to disclose her debts.  She provided a copy of that 2005 credit\nreport she had submitted in 2005 after the hearing.  (Answer; TR 21; 42, 46-48; Exhibit A)\nInvestigation revealed a substantial number of debts.  (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6) In response to\nan Interrogatory that questioned her about over two dozens debts, Applicant replied in March 2007\nthat she could not make payment arrangements for so many bills, so had consulted a lawyer to file\nChapter 13 bankruptcy.  She listed the status of seventeen debtors and explained she had talked\nto sixteen creditors.  Some bills had been turned over to one or two different other collectors.  She\nindicated she had net monthly income of approximately $2,000, expenses of approximately $1,500\nand a mortgage payment of $344.  She had a net remainder of $236 each month.  (Exhibit 2)\nThe SOR alleged 41 debts which total $52,162 for medical bills, credit cards and other\n\n4\nconsumer purchases.  (Some were duplicate listings.) She admitted each of the delinquent debts\nincurred from 1999 to present.  Prior to filing bankruptcy she had not been able to pay off any of\nthe debts.  She was only make $9 per hour in her previous job. In her current job she makes\n$29,000 per year. (Answer; TR 32-33) Her intent if filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in April 2007\nwas to include all of her debts and have a plan to resolve them. (TR 54)\nApplicant explained her special circumstances led to her financial problems.  She had big\nmedical bills after she had three major surgeries in eight days in 1999 and was out of work for six\nmonths; she had sick leave with the job where she had worked for twenty years.  After that\ncompany went out of business in 2001, she got a layoff package for six months and unemployment\nfor six months.  She stayed home for a year.  When those benefits ran out, she went back to work.\n(TR 25-28)  She had insurance but that did not cover all of her medical costs.  Her wages were\ngarnished from February to April 2007 for some of the medical bills before she filed the\nbankruptcy.  (TR 38) Other special circumstances, in addition to being unemployed from October\n2000 to November 2001, was that she had co-signed a car loan for a paraplegic friend that she later\nbecame responsible for paying.

(Exhibits\n1, 7, 8, 9)\nApplicant did not believe she could get a loan to cover all these payments, so she  filed for\nChapter 13 Bankruptcy on April 1, 2007 which included a certificate of credit counseling.  She\n\n5\ndisclosed $42,00 in assets and $72,000 in liabilities.  Her assets include a trailer and a 1993 car.\nThe Order granting Minutes and Motion to Confirm Chapter 13 Plan was issued on June 5, 2007.\nThe plan was approved; and she is to pay $200 per month for 36 months for a total of $7,200.\n(Exhibits 7, 8, 9; TR 22; 40-41; 45)  She started making payments in May 2007 and has made four\n$200 monthly payments.  (TR 22; Exhibit A)  The bankruptcy court requires a credit counseling\nclass which she attended.  (TR 39)\nIn August 2007 she reported her expenses in addition to the $200 bankruptcy payment:\na payment on her mortgage and insurance of $325; electric $250; water & trash $30; car insurance\n$50; gasoline for work $140; food $200, cell phone $50; son in college $50; and cable $100.  (TR\n43; Exhibit A)  \nReferences\nThe shop steward for pipefitters has known Applicant for six years since 2001; he assesses\nher as an excellent at her work as she plays an integral part in the workplace.  She is trustworthy\nand dependable and an asset to the company.  (Exhibit A)\nThe production supervisor for satellite ship support shops has known Applicant since 2001.\nShe worked under his direct supervision for three years.  He assessed her as a \u201chardworking self\nstarter who invariably understands what a project is all about from the outset, and how to get it\ndone quickly and effectively.\u201d   He sees her as honest and supportive and a well-balanced person\nwith an abundance of positive qualities.  (Exhibit A)\nA friend who has known Applicant for 15 years stated she is a reliable and trustworthy\nperson.  (Exhibit A)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In\ndeciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the\nadministrative judge considers the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case and weighs relevant\nrevised Adjudication Guidelines: the mere presence or absence of any adjudication condition is\nnot decisive. \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate\npersuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the\nclearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended and revised, and the\nDirective, as amended and revised, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance\nmay be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative\nJudge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis\nin the evidence of record.  \n\n       Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e) potentially apply: \n4\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to\nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance\nis not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant. It\nis merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n \u00b6 18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it\nmay lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nThe government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems reflected\nby her accumulating over $50,000 in medical, credit card, and other debts that have persisted.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. \nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation  to overcome the case against her.  In large part,\n4\nApplicant\u2019s debts grew out of medical expenses in 1999, unemployment from 2000 to 2001, and\nunderemployment from 2001 to present where as a single mother she could not manage to resolve\nher past debts on her limited income.  Afer earning only make $9 per hour in her previous job, n\nher current job she makes only $29,000 per year. She established, in large part, that many of  her\n\n       AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\n5\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  \n      The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue\n6\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some\nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not\ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith\n\u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence,\nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than\nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order\nto claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n       AG \u00b6 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\n7\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). \n       AG\u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\n8\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\n7\ndebts were due to conditions beyond her control.   \n5\nAfter she received the Interrogatories and understood the security significance of her\ndelinquent debts, but before receiving the SOR, Applicant took action and concluded that her most\nresponsible way to resolve the debts was to file for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy which she did on April\n1, 2007. This chapter of the Bankruptcy Code provides for adjustment of debts of an individual\nwith regular income. (Chapter 13 allows a debtor to keep property and pay debts over time, usually\nthree to five years.)  Significantly, Applicant chose to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 instead\nof Chapter 7 where her debts would have been discharged.   Ultimately, the Chapter 13 plan was\napproved for her to pay $200 per month for a total of $7,200 over a three-year period; she has\nmade four payments.  While she showed unsound judgment in her delay in addressing these issues,\nshe now has initiated a conscientious plan and has already shown a consistent approach to\nresolving the debts by her monthly payments to the plan which establishes her good faith .  Thus,\n6\nshe largely meets AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) because she took these steps to use legally available means\nto resolve her delinquent debt.  To her credit, there was no evidence of her having developed any\nnew debts beyond those growing out of her special circumstances. \nFurther, Applicant provided evidence of receiving counseling  for these financial problems\n7\nas she did comply with the course that the Bankruptcy court requires.  She certified to the court\nhaving completed it.  She has  made substantial steps to turn around her financial issues. AG \u00b6\n20(a)  does apply as the circumstances seem unlikely to recur and two of her children are now\n8\n\n      See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n9\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nfinancially independent and she has established a responsible work record in her current job.\nOverall, Applicant has established a substantial case in mitigation, but her reform is so recent that\nit is important also to assess her as a whole person. \nWhole Person Analysis\nEvaluating Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I conclude she is an earnest\nperson who demonstrated her initiative in developing a solution to her delinquent debt by using\nthe legally availably path of filing for bankruptcy once she understood the security significance\nof her debts. She filed under Chapter 13 even before the SOR was issued to her.  She has been\nconsistent in making four payments to resolve these debts.  Also, she has changed her financial\npractices and developed a budget.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is\nslight as she has a stable and impressive employment history with the confidence of her\nsupervisors.  Notably, two key people at her work site praise her performance and character highly\nand have confidence in her trustworthiness.  Based on these assessments of two officials who\nknow Applicant well, I conclude favorably for her based on a whole person assessment.  As she\nis earnestly working to resolve her financial problems, the likelihood of new debts and related\nproblems is low. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has  mitigated the security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule for  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.a.o. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nGuideline E:  Personal Conduct\n\u00b6 15. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and a\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  \nApplicant denies she had any intent to falsify by not including all of her debts on the\nsecurity form.  She asserts she provided a 2005 credit report that listed her debts.  I found her\nexplanation credible that it was not her intent to falsify.  An administrative judge must consider\nthe record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nconcerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.   Based on\n9\nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of her as a whole person, I conclude  Guideline E  in\nfavor of Applicant.  While she admits she rushed in completing the form, she did reveal three of\nher debts, so her omissions on the form were not total.  The Government failed to show she had\nan intent to falsify by omission.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and\nall the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person as discussed above, I conclude\n\n9\nshe has refuted the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct.  I rule for Applicant on\nsubparagraphs 2.a. under SOR Paragraph 2.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nin Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.a.o.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance\nis granted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n                                            \n1 Applicant offered a copy of a Security Clearance Application, dated June 2006, into evidence that he \ncompleted and submitted to the Government.  It was marked Applicant Exhibit A. Some of the information \ncontained in it is included, verbatim, on the SOR and in two sets of Interrogatories that are part of this \nrecord. \nMarch 12, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 13, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 1, \n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 11, 2007, and I \nreceived the case assignment on October 16, 2007. After coordinating with Applicant\u2019s \ndeployment schedule, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 31, 2007, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on January 23, 2007. The Government offered \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 3, which were received into the record without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibit (AE) A that was admitted into the record \nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 31, \n2008. The record was left open until February 15, 2008, to give Applicant time to submit \nadditional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE B through O that were admitted \ninto the record without objections from Department Counsel.   \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 14). The request and the attached documents are \nincluded in the record as Administrative Exhibits (AE) I through VII. Applicant did not \nobject to my consideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 13, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h of the SOR and denied \u00b6 1.h, with explanations. \nHe admitted that he omitted information as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.j, but denied that \nhe falsified the information requested in the e-QIP and offered explanations.  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He was born in Iraq. He came to the United States in \n1992. After arriving in the United States in 1992, he held various jobs in private industry. \nIn June 2005, he began working as a bilingual bicultural advisor for a federal contractor \nthat provides support for the U.S. Army in Iraq where he is currently deployed. He was \ndeployed there from July 2005 until October 2005. He returned to Iraq in May 2006 and \ndid not come back to the United States until January 2008 for this hearing. (Tr. 57). \n \n \nApplicant attended high school and undergraduate college in Iraq, receiving a \nBachelor\u2019s of Arts Degree in Economics in 1988. As required by the Iraqi government, \nhe served in its army from 1989 to 1991. (Tr. 18). After fleeing Iraq with his father and \nbrother he went to a fugitive camp in Saudi Arabia, before arriving in the United States \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nas a refugee in September 1992. He was 24 years old. (Tr.19). In 1999, he became a \nU.S. citizen. (GE 1 at 7). \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. His mother died in 1973 in Iraq and \nhis father died in 2003 while living in the United States.  He is one of nine children, all \nborn in Iraq. Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces killed three of his brothers and targeted his father \nfor arrest. (Tr. 17). During his school years, Saddam Hussein\u2019s party harassed him. One \nof his sisters was tortured in jail. (Tr. 22). His remaining brother and one sister live in the \nUnited States.  His three other sisters are citizen residents of Iraq, along with their \nfamilies. (Tr. 26).  He telephones them a couple times a year. (Tr. 33). While previously \nstationed in Iraq, he spoke to them once a week. They did not visit him because he was \nnot permitted to have physical contact with them. None of them have visited him in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 34). \n \n \nAfter his mother died, Applicant\u2019s father remarried an Iraqi woman in 1978. They \nhad five boys and four girls, all born in Iraq, and now residing in the United States. (Tr. \n20). He and his father helped them immigrate to the United States, beginning in 1995. \nHis stepmother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2004, and his stepsiblings are \nalien residents. (Tr. 20-21; 28; AE 1). \n \n \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant married an Iraqi woman, who was living in the United States. \nShe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1999. They have two children, \nborn in the United States, and await the arrival of their third child. His mother-in-law is \nan Iraqi citizen, residing in the United States as a resident alien. His father-in-law was \nborn in Iraq and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 32).  His wife\u2019s six siblings reside in \nthe United States. (Tr. 13).  \n \n \nIn 1968, Applicant\u2019s grandfather, an Iraqi citizen resident, died and left a piece of \nproperty, with an estimated value of $460,000, to Applicant\u2019s father and his other \nchildren. Because Applicant\u2019s father died in 2003, Applicant, along with his numerous \nsiblings, may inherit a portion of his father\u2019s share of that estate. Applicant speculates \nthat the amount he may receive will be less than $10,000, based on the number of his \nfather\u2019s heirs. (Tr. 36). Title to the property remains in his grandfather\u2019s name. (Tr. 35).  \nApplicant, personally, owns two homes in the United States valued at $170,000 with a \n$100,000 mortgage. (Tr. 37).  \n \n \n \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \nthrough his employer, who supplied some assistance in its completion. (AE A). In \nFebruary 2006, he received a request to complete an e-QIP, which he did and returned \nto the Government. (GE 1). In April 2007, he answered a set of Interrogatories in follow-\nup to his responses in the e-QIP. (GE 2). Based on those answers, he received another \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nset of very specific Interrogatories that he answered and returned in July 2007. (GE 3). \nApplicant was in Iraq at the time he completed the two sets of Interrogatories. 2  \n \n \nThe August 2007 SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his responses to four \nquestions on the February 2006 e-QIP and to six questions on the April 2007 \nInterrogatory, covering five areas of inquiry. Applicant denied that he intentionally \nfalsified information on either document. (Tr. 59). For purposes of clarity, I refer to all \ndocuments and record evidence relevant to the specific SOR allegations.    \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2.a and 2.i (Foreign Property) \n \n \n \nMay 2005 SF 86: In response to Question 12: Your Foreign Activities \u2013 Property \n(Do you have any foreign property, business connections or financial interests?), \nApplicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d (AE A). \n \n \nFebruary 2006 e-QIP: In completing Section 17a: Your Foreign Activities (Do you \nhave any foreign property, business connections, or financial interests?), he again \nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d  (GE 1). \n \n \nApril 2007 Interrogatory: In response to Question 15 of the: (Do you have any \nfinancial interests (e.g., real estate; bank account; investments; or other financial \nassets) in a foreign country, or receive income (e.g., personal or business income; \npension or retirement income; proceeds from a loan or rent; or other income) from a \nperson, business or other organization located in a foreign country), he answered \u201cNo.\u201c \n(GE 2). \n \n \nJuly 2007 Interrogatory: Question 4 asks specific questions about Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to disclose information about his father\u2019s property on the April 2007 Interrogatory. \nIt notes that \u201cavailable records indicate that you are inheriting approximately $460,000 \nfrom your father\u2019s estate in Iraq.\u201d (GE 3). Applicant explained why he omitted \ninformation about the potential inheritance: [Sic] \u201cI already mentioned that at the CI \nscreening interview. My great grandfather had lift farming land worth a lot of money \ninheritance to a lot of uncles and ants, and I have no interest getting any things of this \nproperty and I lift Iraq long time ago.\u201d (GE 3). At the hearing, he elaborated on the \nomission, indicating that he did not believe it was necessary to repeat what he had \npreviously disclosed and because he had not legally received an interest in the \nproperty. (Tr. 39).   \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n2 During this hearing, Applicant referred to a CI screening interview that he had with an investigator in the \nearly stages of the security clearance application process. The date of that interview is not clear, but it \nappears to have occurred after he executed the May 2005 SF-86. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n2. SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2 b. and 2.e (Applicant\u2019s Iraqi Military Service) \n \n \nMay 2005 SF 86: In response to Question 11: Your Military History (Have you \never served in the military), Applicant disclosed that he was a trainer in the Iraqi army \nfrom January 15, 1989 to March 1, 1991. (AE A).   \n \n \nFebruary 2006 e-QIP: In response to Question 17b: (Are you now or have you \never been employed by or acted as a consultant for a foreign government or agency), \nApplicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d  (GE 1). \n \n \nApril 2007 Interrogatory: In response to Question 1 (Have you ever been \nemployed by, serviced with, or been a member of any of the following: 1.c. foreign \nmilitary (including regular military, paramilitary, militia, or other group engaged in military \noperations)), he answered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 2). \n \n \nJuly 2007 Interrogatory: Question 1 asked: \u201cIn you [sic] interrogatory response, \nyou denied having ever been employed by a foreign government, to include military \nservice. Available records indicate that you served in the Iraqi Army between the \napproximate dates of 1/89-3/90.\u201d (GE 3). In his answer he stated:  [Sic] \u201cSince I \nindicated every little detail in my SF 86 I figured out with myself I didn\u2019t have to repeat \nmyself since the form went to data system.\u201d (Id.; Tr.  44-45).  \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 \u00b6  2 c. and  2.j (Foreign Travel) \n \n \nMay 2005 SF 86: In response to Question 16: Foreign Countries You Have \nVisited within the last seven years, Applicant disclosed ten countries. Between January \n1997 to August 2004, he visited Canada a few times. He visited Denmark, Germany, \nSwitzerland, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, from November 2003 to December \n2003. He visited Jordan on his way to Iraq a few times from August 2003 to November \n2003. In the General Remarks section, at the end of the form, he noted, \u201cDue to \ncontract requirements, I will be working and residing in Iraq.\u201d (AE A). \n \n \nFebruary 2006 e-QIP: In answer to Question 18, which requested the same \ninformation as the SF 86, Applicant noted \u201cNot Applicable.\u201d (GE 1). \n \n \nApril 2007 Interrogatory: In response to Question 28 regarding his travels, he \nlisted three countries: \u201c11-03-12/03-Iraq, Denmark, Germany; 8/03-11/03-Iraq.\u201d (GE 2).   \n \n \nJuly 2007 Interrogatory: Question 5 specifically inquired why he left out \ninformation on the previous interrogatory pertaining to his other travels since December \n2003, in view of his current residence in Iraq. Applicant indicated that he did not think it \nwas necessary to report his residence with the U.S. Army in Iraq from July to October \n2005 or from May 2006 to July 2007. (GE 3).  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n4. SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2 d. and 2.h (Relatives) \n \n \nMay 2005 SF 86: In response to Questions 9 and 10: Your Relatives and \nAssociates, Applicant listed 24 people, including his spouse, parents, stepmother, two \nchildren, four brothers, three sisters, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and nine half-siblings, \nalong with their place of residence and citizenship. (AE A). \n \n \nFebruary 2006 e-QIP: In response to Question 14/15, Applicant listed his \nparents, stepmother, two children, four brothers, and three sisters. He did not list his \nstepsiblings because he had listed all of them on the earlier SF 86. (Tr. 40).  \n \n \nApril 2007 Interrogatory: Question 9 inquired further into his E-QIP\u2019s  answer, \ninquiring whether he \u201chad any immediate family member . . . other relative (including in-\nlaws), cohabitant, friend or business or professional associate, who is a citizen of a \nforeign country, or who lives in a foreign country?\u201d He answered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 2).  \n \n \nJuly 2007 Interrogatory: Question 2 followed up on the interrogatory answer, \nnoting \u201cavailable records indicate that your stepmother, sister, and eight half-siblings are \nall citizens of Iraq residing in the U.S. and that you denied having any family members \nthat were citizens of a foreign country or reside in a foreign country.\u201d (GE 3). Applicant \nexplained that he answered \u201dNo\u201d based on his understanding of the word \u201cforeign.\u201d He \nomitted the information in the April 2007 Interrogatory because: [Sic] \u201cMy understanding \nthat my native country operations dose not mean as a foreign country. And since they \nwere legally reside in US. And they were also in the process to get their US citizenship, \nsome of them already became a US citizen therefore they weren\u2019t consider as a \nforeigners.\u201d (GE 3). He interpreted the word \u201cforeign\u201d to mean any country other than \nIraq, where he was born, or the United States, where he held citizenship. (Tr. 51-52). \n \n5. SOR  \u00b6 \u00b6 2 f. and 2.g (Relative\u2019s Foreign Military Service) \n \n \n \nApril 2007 Interrogatory: Questions 3 and 5 asked whether any of Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members or relatives have been employed in the \u201cforeign military \n(including regular military, paramilitary, militia, or other group engaged in military He \nanswered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose any information about his brother or brother-in-\nlaws\u2019 previous military service. Again, he was confused about the translation of the word \n\u201cforeign.\u201d He also did not have any specific information about his brother-in-laws army \nservice. (Tr. 50).  \n \n \nJuly 2007 Interrogatory: After receiving the interrogatory, inquiring about the \nabove omission, Applicant spoke to some of his colleagues in Iraq about the meaning of \nthe word \u201cforeign.\u201d  He realized he made a mistake and noted in his answer that both \nbrother-in-laws served in the Iraq-Iran war. (GE 3). In his Answer to the SOR, he \nindicated that he previously disclosed his brother\u2019s service in the Iraqi army from \u201c1988 \nto 1991.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and \nsupport for \u201cthe mission of liberation of Iraq hundred percent.\u201d (Tr. 21).  He loves the \nUnited States. \u201cAfter I got to United States I find the freedom here, me and my family. \nWe find like the real life here, . . we love and we will support, will protect this life and this \nreally excellent life in America.\u201d (Tr. 23). \n \n \nThroughout the hearing, Applicant denied any intention to falsify the documents \nhe submitted to the Government. (Tr. 52). \u201cI don\u2019t want to hide any information I have \nabout my background, from like the defense of \u2013Department of Defense or any other \nAmerican agency.\u201d (Tr. 23). While in Iraq, he phoned for assistance in completing the \nforms, but does not remember the date or which document he was completing when he \nmade the call. He was told to answer the questions, as he understood them. (Tr. 67).3 \nDuring cross-examination, he said he did not want to repeat all of the details he \nincluded in the May 2005 SF 86 when he completed the February 2006 e-QIP. He found \nthe forms hard to understand. (Tr. 24). He takes responsibility for not fully completing \nthe E-QIP and April 2007 Interrogatories. (Tr. 61). \n \n \nApplicant joined the U.S. Armed forces to assist with the war on terror. \u201cI joined \nthe force to help them and to help the Iraqis in translating in the advising of the \nAmerican forces commanders. I did that in many camps, in many places. I worked with \nthe commanders at different levels. . . I help with all my effort and all I could to success \nthe mission of freedom of Iraq.\u201d (Tr. 23). Applicant submitted several exhibits attesting \nto his training, capabilities and contributions to those efforts. In June 2005 he completed \na Linguist Training Course. (AE H). In July 2006, he received a certificate of completion \nin \u201cThe Basics of Government Contracting in Iraq.\u201d (AE I). According to his performance \nevaluations for the months of January, March and November 2007, he exceeded \nrequirements in the many categories. His most recent evaluation for January 2008, \nindicate that he exceeded requirements in all categories. (AE C, J, L, and M). He \nreceived a Certificate of Appreciations from his commander for his \u201cexemplary service \nand outstanding cooperation in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom\u201d for the time periods \nof October 1, 2006 to March 2007, and one from April 2007 to March 2008.4 (AE G and \nO).  He has held an interim Secret clearance since working with the U.S. Army. (Tr. 56). \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have target the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.  \n                                            \n3 The 2006 e-QIP does not contain a phone number to call for assistance; however, a contact person and \nphone number are listed on both sets of Interrogatories, giving credence to Applicant\u2019s testimony that he \nsought assistance in completing the forms.  \n4 March 2008 appears to be a typographical error, in that March 2008 is a premature date as of the writing \nof this opinion. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, one of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case: (a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d5  \n \n  \nIn this case, Applicant has some telephonic contact with his three siblings, who \nare resident citizens of Iraq. While he was in Iraq, he phoned them more frequently than \nhe does when he is at home in the United States. His relationship with them potentially \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because \nterrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence and are hostile to United States\u2019 interests, \nand possibly because of his family\u2019s previous experiences with Saddam Hussein\u2019s \nparty.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of this disqualifying condition, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. Two Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifying conditions: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \n                                            \n5 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nApplicant established application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States since 1992, after fleeing \nIraq, and did not return to Iraq until his employment with the U. S. Army in June 2005.  \nThe majority of the members of his large family, including his wife, are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens or resident aliens, residing in the United States. He has two children who were \nborn in the United States. He owns property in the United States. He has worked in the \nUnited States since arriving here with his father and brother over 15 years ago. He \nsubsequently helped all of his other family members immigrate here. There is no \nevidence that he has connections or contact with any people other than his sisters in \nIraq.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c) has some application because Applicant\u2019s relationship with his sisters \nappears to be casual and based on telephone communication rather than personal \ncontact. He cautiously abides by the U.S. Army\u2019s regulation that precludes any physical \ncontact with family members while he is stationed in Iraq.  \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG & 15:       \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant and \npotentially disqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities\u201d may raise a security concern. Applicant incorrectly answered four \nsections on the February 2006 e-QIP and six questions contained in the April 2007 \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nInterrogatories. He denied that he intentionally falsified his answers or attempted to \ndeceive the Government.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in \nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.i allege that Applicant falsified the February 2006 e-QIP and \nApril 2007 Interrogatory because he did not disclose the information about a potential \ninheritance from his father\u2019s estate. Applicant admitted the omission, but asserted that \nhe disclosed the information during the CI interview.  Additionally, he did not believe it \nwas important to list the property on the documents because he had not received a \nlegal right to the property, as title remains in his grandfather\u2019s name. I find Applicant\u2019s \nposition credible, especially in view of the fact that the SOR specifically listed $460,000 \nas the amount of the property, which information came from Applicant in all probability, \nand put the Government on notice of the potential inheritance. Arguably, he was not \nobligated to disclose a speculative interest in a piece of property that had not \ntransferred to him.   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.e allege that Applicant falsified the February 2006 e-QIP and \nApril 2007 Interrogatory because he did not disclose his Iraqi military service from \n\u201cJanuary 1989 to March 1991\u201d on either document.  The SF 86 listed those specific \ndates.  The Government obviously had notice of his conscription into the Iraqi army from \nthe SF 86 when it drafted the April 2007 Interrogatories because it included those dates \non subsequent documents. As an aside, Question 17 on the e-QIP does not specifically \nask about previous foreign military service, but whether one has acted as a foreign \nconsultant. That distinction could be confusing to an applicant. \n \n   SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.j allege that Applicant falsified the February 2006 e-QIP and \nApril 2007 Interrogatory because he did not list all of his travel and travel dates. The \nallegations recited various countries and travel dates that he allegedly omitted. The \nGovernment must have had previous notice of his specific travel history and his \nintentions to reside and work in Iraq when it drafted the April 2007 Interrogatories, as it \nincorporated specific facts listed on the SF 86. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.h allege that Applicant falsified the February 2006 e-QIP and \nApril 2007 Interrogatory because he failed to disclose certain family members, and their \ncitizenship and residency. Applicant listed 24 family members on the SF 86, including \nhis spouse, mother-in-law, father-in-law, nine half-siblings, his sisters, stepmother, and \nbrothers-in-law, along with their residency and citizenship at the time he completed the \nform. The Government clearly had notice of all of his relatives because in the April 2007 \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nInterrogatory and SOR, it specifically referred to some of his relatives that he listed on \nthe SF 86.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g allege that Applicant falsified the February 2006 e-QIP and \nApril 2007 Interrogatory because he did not disclose his brother\u2019s or brother-in-laws\u2019 \nservice in the Iraqi army. In his Answer, he stated that he previously disclosed the \nspecific dates of his brother\u2019s conscription that were contained in the SOR, indicating \nthat the Government had notice of his brother\u2019s military service. In regard to omitting his \nbrother-in-laws\u2019 service records, he initially misunderstood the word \u201cforeign\u201d when \nreviewing those documents, and additionally, did not have specific information about the \ntimes or positions his family members served. Both explanations are believable. \n \nApplicant admitted that he omitted certain information from the e-QIP and April \n2007 Interrogatory. However, he also provided evidence that he thoroughly disclosed \nthe information, allegedly omitted, in the May 2005 SF86 or during a subsequent \ninterview. Based on that, he believed the information was in the Government\u2019s \u201cdata \nsystem\u201d and that he had made sufficient disclosure. While it would have been more \nprudent for Applicant to re-disclose the information in the e-QIP and April 2007 \nInterrogatory and not rely on his personal interpretation of the disclosure requirements, I \ndo not find his omissions rising to a level of intentional wrongdoing in an effort to \ndeceive the Government. Nor do I find that such omissions raise questions about his \nreliability or ability to protect classified information. Based on the documentary evidence \nin this record, Applicant\u2019s demeanor and obvious language differences (given his native \nlanguage is not English), his explanations for the omissions are reasonable. I believe \nsome of the omissions were possibly misguided or negligent, and others were the result \nof confusion, but none of them were intentional.  Hence, the evidence does not \nestablish deliberate falsification. Accordingly, Guideline E is found in his favor.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \u201c. \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, \nrehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this \n\n \n \n \n \n13\nadjudication.6 Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nvarious human rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists \nare hostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and \neven friendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s sisters to obtain such \ninformation. Second, he had numerous connections to Iraq before he immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1992. Following his birth, he spent his formative years there, along with \na large family. He was educated at an Iraqi university and subsequently was \nconscripted into its army. Third, his sisters and their families remain resident citizens of \nIraq. Fourth, he has some contact with his siblings. Fifth, three of his brothers were \nkilled by the Hussein\u2019s regime and his father was targeted for arrest by it. His sister was \ntortured and he was harassed for holding contrary political beliefs.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 15 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for eight and a half years.  His spouse has been living in \nthe United States for a number of years and is a naturalized citizen, as are his two \nchildren. He obviously has a strong sense of patriotism toward the United States, as \nwitnessed by his dedication and work with the U.S. Army. There is no evidence he has \never taken any action that could cause potential harm to the United States. His military \nsupervisors, who work with him daily in a war zone, praise his work in the cause of \nfreedom in Iraq. After fleeing Iraq in 1992, he never returned until he worked with the \nU.S. Army in July 2005. He appreciates his new life in the United States and \nopportunities. \n \nApplicant held a security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. Army without \nany indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n                                            \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n \n \n \n14\n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.7 Overall, the record evidence, \nincluding his testimony, leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2. through 2.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n7 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b68 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n15\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 66-year-old man who has been employed by a defence contractor since approximately 1985 with varying periods of unemployment during that time due to layoffs. The security clearance applications contained in the FORM indicate Applicant served in the Army from August 1961 until March 1970, and the Air Force from October 1970 until March 1982, although they indicate it was as an inactive reservist. However, Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he is a Viet Nam veteran and in a statement he provided he attributed his financial problems in 1984 to excessive debt he accumulated while in the military. Whether from active duty or as a reservist, Applicant retired from the Air Force in 1982. Applicant has been married four times. The first marriage was from July 1960 until April 1967. The second marriage was from approximately October 1967 until October 1994. The third marriage was from February 1995 until June 2004. Applicant has been married to his current wife since August 2004. Applicant has six adult children. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in or about October 1984.

Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR,\ndated September 5, 2007, in which he admitted all SOR allegations and provided various\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 23, 2008\n\n2\nexplanations and clarifications to the allegations. Applicant requested a clearance decision\nbased on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on\nOctober 9, 2007, that was mailed to Applicant on October 11, 2007,and informed him he\nhad 30 days from receipt of the documents to submit his objections or information he\nwished to be considered. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM or object to\nanything contained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was assigned to\nme on December 13, 2007.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 66-year-old man who has been employed by a defence contractor\nsince approximately 1985 with varying periods of unemployment during that time due to\nlayoffs. The security clearance applications contained in the FORM indicate Applicant\nserved in the Army from August 1961 until March 1970, and the Air Force from October\n1970 until March 1982, although they indicate it was as an inactive reservist. However,\nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he is a Viet Nam veteran and in a statement\nhe provided he attributed his financial problems in 1984 to excessive debt he accumulated\nwhile in the military. Whether from active duty or as a reservist, Applicant retired from the\nAir Force in 1982.\nApplicant has been married four times. The first marriage was from July 1960 until\nApril 1967. The second marriage was from approximately October 1967 until October\n1994. The third marriage was from February 1995 until June 2004. Applicant has been\nmarried to his current wife since August 2004. Applicant has six adult children.\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in or about October 1984. His\nmonthly net income at that time, including military retired pay, was $1,621.93. His wife\u2019s\nmonthly net income was $430.00. Their total monthly living expenses were $1,873.00.\nApplicant listed outstanding debts in the amount of $4,521.04 in the bankruptcy petition.\nIn a statement he provided in May 2000, Applicant attributed his 1984 financial problems\nto excessive debt due to over spending. Applicant successfully completed the plan and\nobtained a discharge in March 1987. \nApplicant next filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 1989. His\nmonthly net income at that time, including military retired pay, was $2,500.00. His wife\u2019s\nmonthly net income was $842.00. Their total monthly living expenses were $2,712.00.\nApplicant listed delinquent state and federal taxes in the total amount of $9,317,00,\nmortgage payments in arrears in the amount of $7,348.00, and unsecured debts in the\namount of $1,727.00 in this bankruptcy petition. In a statement he provided in May 2000,\nApplicant attributed his 1989 financial problems to being laid-off from work. The plan was\ndismissed because Applicant did not have funds to make payments under the plan. \n\n3\nApplicant again filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in February 1996. His\nmonthly net income at that time, including military retired pay, was listed as $1,285.00.\nApplicant, having listed his monthly retirement pay as $635.00 in the 1984 petition and as\n$780.00 in the 1989 petition, only claimed $445.00 per month as retirement pay in the\n1996 petition, likely because a portion of his retirement pay had been ordered paid to his\nex-wife. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s monthly net income was listed as $300.00. Their total income\nfrom employment was listed as $36,000 in 1994 and only $4,000 in 1995. Applicant also\nclaimed as income of $195 per week from unemployment but did not list anything for\nretired pay. Their total monthly living expenses were $1,245.00. Applicant listed delinquent\nstate and federal taxes in the total amount of $43,628,00, secured claims in the amount\nof $2,398.25, and unsecured debts in the amount of $41,681.00, excluding $30,000.00 that\nis included in the delinquent taxes noted above in this bankruptcy petition. \nIn the statement he provided in May 2000, Applicant attributed his 1996 financial\nproblems to a number of factors, including his 1994 divorce and the resulting child support\nand alimony he was required to pay, being laid-off from work from January 1995 to January\n1997, and past debts incurred during earlier lay-offs. Applicant successfully completed the\nplan on this bankruptcy and obtained a discharge in August 2000.\nApplicant once more filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in or about\nNovember 2003. The pleadings for this bankruptcy are not included in the FORM.\nHowever, Applicant was interviewed in July 2006, at which time he stated his net monthly\nincome, including retired pay, was $3,400, and his net monthly expenses were $2,346. His\nwife did not have any income. Applicant also provided a personal financial statement in\nMarch 2007, in which he listed his net monthly income as $6,323 (the documents he\nprovided in response to interrogatories in March 2007, indicate his net monthly income is\nactually about $5,100), and his net monthly expenses as $2,272. Again his wife is not listed\nas having any income. The significant increase in income, whether as he listed in his\nfinancial statement or as reflected in the documents he provided, is apparently due to\nApplicant receiving social security payments in the amount of $1,538.00 beginning in\nJanuary 2007.\nApplicant listed unsecured claims in the amount of $16,626.27, priority claims in the\namount of $2,635, and secured claims in the amount of $20,545.09 in the 2003\nbankruptcy. Amounts ranging from the current $141 to as high as $292 have been\ngarnished from Applicant\u2019s pay every week since October 1, 2003, to make the payments\nrequired under the plan. During the July 2006 interview, Applicant attributed his need to file\nfor bankruptcy protection in 2003 to a strike being called by his labor union in either late\n2001 or early 2002, the resulting loss of income, and the divorce he was going through in\n2002. Applicant estimated at that time that he would complete the scheduled payments\nunder the plan in or about June 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports, dated November 2005 and January 2007, indicate\nApplicant had two tax liens that were either released and/or paid in September 2000.\nFurther, most, if not all, accounts listed in those credit reports were included in the 2003\nbankruptcy.   \n \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n10\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant found it necessary to seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on four\noccasions. The bankruptcy petitions filed in 1984, 1996 and 2003 were approved and\nrepayment plans ordered. The petition filed in 1996 was dismissed because Applicant\nlacked income with which to make payments under any plan that could have been\napproved. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nDC 19\u00a9: a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant candidly admitted that the 1984 bankruptcy resulted from he and his wife\nspending excessively while he was in the military. Applicant made all payments required\nunder the plan that was ordered in this bankruptcy and obtained a discharge in March\n1987.\nApplicant attributed the 1989 bankruptcy to being laid off from work. Items 9 and 13\nof the FORM substantiate that Applicant and his wife earned $38,560 in 1988, and that his\nemployment with a defense contractor was terminated on December 2, 1988. His verified\nanswer to questions 2a, 2c and 2d in the bankruptcy petition he executed on September\n30, 1989 (Item 9) indicate he was unemployed for most if not all of the time between\nDecember 1988 and September 1989. Applicant\u2019s debts listed in this bankruptcy consisted\nof delinquent state and federal taxes, $1,727 of unsecured debt, and delinquent mortgage\npayments that appear to coincide with the period of his unemployment.\nApplicant attributed his 1996 financial problems to a number of factors, including his\n1994 divorce and the resulting child support and alimony he was required to pay, being\nlaid-off from work from January 1995 to January 1997, and past debts incurred during\nearlier lay-offs. Again, Applicant\u2019s verified answers to questions posed to him in the\nbankruptcy petition substantiate his claim of unemployment with his income from\nemployment falling from $32,000 in 1994, to $0.00 in 1995, and $864 through the first two\nmonths of 1996. Applicant successfully completed the plan that was ordered in this\nbankruptcy and obtained a discharge in August 2000.\nApplicant once again filed for bankruptcy protection in 2003, and again attributed\nhis financial problems to the loss of income that resulted from a labor strike. The Summary\nof Claims listed on page 9 of Item 7 indicates that as of February 15, 2007, Applicant had\npaid $35,566.85 in principal and interest under the plan toward the 26 claims totalling\n$39,806.36 that had been filed. Page 6 of Item 7 discloses that $141 per week was being\ngarnished from his wages to make payments under the plan as of February 16, 2007.\n\n6\nThus, it is reasonable to conclude that if Applicant has maintained his employment he has\neither successfully completed the plan as of this time or will do so in the very near future.\nApplicant\u2019s repeated periods of unemployment, coupled with his divorces and the\nresulting child support and maintenance payments, and his legal action in seeking Chapter\n13 bankruptcy protection and thereafter making all required payments under the plans\nentitle him to application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and MC 20(d) the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nDepartment Counsel correctly points out in the FORM that a number of debts listed\nin Applicant\u2019s 1989 and 1996 bankruptcies became delinquent before the events which he\nclaimed triggered his need to seek bankruptcy protection. And, while it is reasonable to\nassume it would take Applicant some period of time to regain financial stability after being\nunemployed, there is no record evidence to indicate he could not or should not have\nresolved some if not all of the delinquent debt, most specifically the state and federal tax\nliabilities, prior to having to file a subsequent bankruptcy. \nHowever, whatever negative connotations may be drawn from Applicant\u2019s failure to\naddress delinquent debts before those triggering events, is overwhelmingly outweighed by\nApplicant\u2019s current financial condition. He is now employed and receives both monthly\nmilitary retirement pay and social security. The documents Applicant provided in Item 7\nindicate that as of February 2007, his net monthly income is approximately $5,100 and his\nnet monthly expenses are $2,272. $2,715 of his net monthly income comes from retirement\nand social security payments that will continue even if he again experiences a period of\nunemployment. Thus, he now has the income to remain current on his expenses\nregardless of what happens to his employment. Or, to put it another way, Applicant for the\nfirst time since at least 1984 has found himself in a financially secure position. Accordingly,\nApplicant is entitled to application of MC 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.\nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns caused by the financial considerations that are present in this case. He has\novercome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \n \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Minster, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 15, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), on\nMarch 17, 2006. (Item 1.) On March 24, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines  E (Personal Conduct) and F (Financial Considerations). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 13, 2010, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on May 20, 2010. The Applicant received the FORM on June\n1, 2010, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. He elected not to\nsubmit any additional information. The case was assigned to me on August 19, 2010.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 28, and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to\nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Government during the\nclearance screening process.  The Applicant admitted the single allegation under this\nguideline.\nApplicant filled out a Questionnaire for National Security Positions on March 17,\n2006.  (Item 1.) In that Questionnaire, the Applicant was required to answer Section\n24.a., which asked whether the Applicant had used any illegal drugs in the last seven\nyears, or since the age of 16, whichever was shorter. He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d This was a\nfalse answer since the Applicant had, in fact, used marijuana from 1998 to 2004,\ncocaine in 2003 and 2004, and heroin in 2003 and 2004. In fact, the Applicant admitted\nin an April 2007 interview with a Government investigator that, in February 2004, he\noverdosed on heroin and had to be hospitalized. (Item 6 at 3.) In the same interview,\nwhen asked about his falsification, he said:\nThe reason I did not list my past illegal drug use on my application\nor at my last interview was because I was ashamed of it. When I first met\nthe investigator I was not sure what to expect of the investigation. I used\nillegal drugs in the past after my mother passed away. I did not think it\nwould have an impact on my clearances. I am not proud of my past drug\nusage and I am trying to put the past behind me and start over. (Item 6 at\n4.) \nThe Applicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI agree that I made some mistakes during\nthe investigation period. I was nervous and not sure what to expect.\u201d  (Item 4 at 5.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR under this paragraph.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits substantiate, 15 delinquent debts\ntotaling $25,585. (SOR 1.a. through 1.o.) Some of these debts have been due and\nowing since 2001-2004. (Items 7, 8, and 9.)\n\n3\nApplicant states that his poor financial situation is primarily due to his history of\ndrug abuse, and poor judgment with regards to managing his finances. He stopped\nusing alcohol and drugs in 2004, but has been unable to pay any of his past due debts\nsince then. (Item 6 at 4.)\nIn his Answer, Applicant states that he is attempting to fix his credit. He attached\na letter from a company he hired to resolve the issues. However, the company states in\nthe letter that they \u201cspecialize in credit report restoration.\u201d (Item 4 at 6.) There is no\nevidence in the record as to which debts of the Applicant, if any, have been paid or\nremoved.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n4\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Applicant admitted that he falsified the Government Questionnaire\nconcerning his serious drug use up to the year 2004. \nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to this case, concerning the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 17(c) has also been considered. It states that\nfalsification can be mitigated where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s single falsification occurred four years ago, and concerned activities\nthat happened more than six years ago. He has expressed sincere remorse and intent\nnot to engage in such conduct in the future. Under the particular circumstances of this\ncase, he has mitigated the security significance of his conduct. Paragraph 1 is found for\nthe Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\n\n5\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, has over $25,000 in past due debts,\nall of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties started about 2001, and continue to the present. In addition,\nApplicant has failed to provide any evidence that he is paying any of his debts, or has\nany plan to do so. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his financial\nsituation has improved.  He has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable\nto this case.  \nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  There is no\ntrack record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6\n20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is $25,000 in debt, I cannot find\nthat \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d\nas required by AG \u00b6 20(c). Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n\n6\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is under financial strain,\nand has been so for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(3), Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find\nthat there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at\nthe present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nParagraph 2 is found against the Applicant. As stated above, Paragraph 1 is found for\nthe Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge denied him due process;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s credibility determination was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is currently employed by a Defense contractor.  He served\nin the U.S. military from 1984 until 2004, retiring as an E-7.  Between 1988 until 2007, Applicant\nengaged in six instances of domestic violence, though none resulted in prosecution or other\ndisciplinary action beyond referral to the military Family Advocacy Program at his station or some\nanger management classes.  The first instance occurred in July 1988 in a foreign country where\nApplicant was assigned, along with his family.  Applicant and his wife argued on the side of a\nhighway.  Applicant hit, pushed, kicked and shoved his wife, who was pregnant at the time, causing\nher to fall to the ground.  He then grabbed her jacket and dragged her along the side of the road.  On\nanother occasion he shoved her on the ground and pushed her against the house.  In some of the\nincidents cited by the Judge, Applicant\u2019s wife was an active participant in the affrays.  \nApplicant received numerous awards during his military service, to include the Meritorious\nService Medal, two Commendation Medals, six Good Conduct Medals, and the Bronze Star.\nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Specifically, he disagrees\nwith the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant made an inconsistent statement to the OPM investigator.\nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility in light of the record as\na whole and finds no reason to disturb it.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant and his wife made\ninconsistent and otherwise unbelievable statements, including Applicant\u2019s statement to the OPM\ninvestigator, is supported by the record.   See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant contends that the\n1\nJudge improperly denied him the opportunity to question a witness about the Lautenberg\nAmendment,  which forbids gun ownership or use by persons convicted of domestic violence.  The\n2\nBoard construes this to be a contention that the Judge denied Applicant due process.  The record\ndemonstrates that the Judge admitted a document summarizing the Amendment and its application\n\n3\nto the military.  However, the Judge did not permit Applicant to read it aloud during his questioning\nof a witness due to lack of relevance.  Tr. at 34.  The Judge\u2019s ruling is sustainable.  Even if there\nwere error in this ruling, it would be harmless. \n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision\nat 10.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett                 \nJeffrey D.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn April 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on June 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 9, 2009. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n9, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nfive witnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A-1 through A-28, B, C, and D, which were \nreceived without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 16, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the \nU.S. Army from 1984 to 2004, and retired as a sergeant first class (E-7). He is currently \nattending college in pursuit of a Bachelor of Science degree. He has been married since \n1984. He has four children, ages 23, 19, 9, and 8.1  \n \n \nThe security concerns were based on a series of domestic violence detentions, \narrests, and charges over a course of almost 20 years. Applicant and his wife described \na series of tragic and stressful events during their marriage. Their first child was stillborn \nin 1984. The loss of the child had a very traumatic effect on his wife. Because of genetic \nabnormalities, all her pregnancies were complicated with risk of severe birth defects. \nShe suffered from many emotional and psychological issues throughout their marriage. \nShe stated that she was diagnosed with severe panic attack disorder, anxiety disorder, \nmajor depressive disorder, agoraphobia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s many deployments, unaccompanied tours, service schools, field training \nexercises, and other travels added to her stress. He deployed in support of Operation \nDesert Shield/Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other humanitarian and \npeacekeeping operations. She has been under the care of psychologists and \npsychiatrists and on medication for many years. She was hospitalized for psychiatric \nreasons on several occasions, including in 1986 and 2006. She also admitted to some \ndrinking problems. She had an ongoing affair with her psychologist and other \nextramarital affairs. One of their children was severely burned in 1999, and almost died. \nThe child required a long period of hospitalization, numerous surgeries, and extensive \nphysical therapy. They had to move to where the child could be treated and live in \ndifficult conditions. Applicant\u2019s step-father passed away in 1993, while they were in \nGermany and his wife\u2019s father died in 2003. His wife indicated that she is now doing \nmuch better. She recently obtained a job with a federal agency and indicated that she \nnow understands the importance of a security clearance, because she received a \nclearance through her job.2  \n \n \nApplicant was serving in Germany with the U.S. Army in 1988. In the early \nmorning hours of July 9, 1988, Applicant and his wife argued on the highway. The \nargument turned violent when he hit, pushed, kicked, and shoved her, causing her to fall \nto the ground. He then grabbed her jacket and dragged her along the side of the road. \nHis wife was holding on to their two-year-old child during the assault and she was eight-\nweeks pregnant at the time. The incident was observed by two local women who pulled \nto the side of the road to assist. Applicant fled the scene. The two women bought \nApplicant\u2019s wife and child to the hospital and told the doctor what happened. The doctor \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 66, 153; GE 1, 4. \n \n2 Tr. at 68-114, 126-127; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A-15 to A-24. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nnoted that she was \u201cvery bewildered, crying, the clothing is dirty, in particular the back \nand buttock area.\u201d He noted that \u201c[t]he child is totally bewildered and states constantly \nthat he was hit by his daddy.\u201d The Military Police (MP) were notified and Applicant was \napprehended and transported to the MP station. The MP report noted that he was \nadvised of his rights, waived them, and made a sworn statement. He attributed his \nwife\u2019s injuries to her having \u201ca fit.\u201d Applicant was referred to Family Counseling and \nsuccessfully completed all sessions. No further disciplinary action was taken. Both \nApplicant and his wife completely denied any memory of this incident.3  \n \n \nApplicant was serving on a post in the United States in 1994. A 911 call was \nreceived from Applicant\u2019s home at about 5:30 in the afternoon on November 27, 1994. \nThe MPs went to the home and found that Applicant and his wife were involved in a \nverbal altercation that turned physical when they began pushing each other. He was \ntransported to the MP station. The MP report noted that he was advised of his rights, \nwaived them, and made a sworn statement, admitting to the incident. He attended and \ncompleted a family advocacy program. No disciplinary action was taken. Applicant and \nhis wife both testified that they did not remember this incident.4 \n \n \nApplicant was serving on a different post in the United States in 1999. At around \n10:30 in the morning on December 23, 1999, the MPs were notified of a domestic \ndisturbance at Applicant\u2019s home. Their investigation revealed that Applicant and his wife \nwere involved in an argument when he grabbed her on both sides of her face and shook \nher head. She was pregnant at the time. They were escorted to the MP station. The MP \nreport noted that he was advised of his rights, waived them, and made a sworn \nstatement, admitting to the incident. No disciplinary action was taken. Applicant \nadmitted that he grabbed his wife on both sides of her face and shook her head. He \nstated that he did it because she \u201cwas having a severe panic attack and nervous \nbreakdown in the emergency room of [the] Army Medical Center.\u201d5 \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was serving on another post in the United States. At around \n10:00 in the evening on March 15, 2002, the MPs were dispatched to Applicant\u2019s home. \nHis wife told the MPs that they were having an argument when Applicant struck her \nbehind the head with an open hand. He was transported to the MP station. The MP \nreport noted that he was advised of his rights, waived them, but did not make a \nstatement. He was referred to family advocacy. He attended and completed the Senior \nNCO/Officer\u2019s Group Parent Awareness Education Class. The Chief of the Department \nof Social Work noted that Applicant \u201cdemonstrated active participation, completed all \nassignments for the time he attended group.\u201d No disciplinary action was taken. \nApplicant testified that this incident was the culmination of several days of arguments. \nHe was about to be away for several months for training prior to deploying to Iraq, and \nhis wife was very upset. He stated that she threw things at him and \u201cliterally chased one \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 74-79, 128-130, 141; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 9. \n \n4 Tr. at 130-132, 142-143; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8; AE A-1. \n \n5 Tr. at 143-144; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nof [the] children around with a frying pan.\u201d He testified \u201cI don\u2019t recall striking my wife. I \nrecall pushing my wife. I\u2019ve never once, can never remember physically doubling up my \nfist or slapping my wife, for that fact.\u201d His wife testified that she shoved him into a door \nin the kitchen and \u201c[h]e became angry and shoved [her] back into the kitchen cabinet,\u201d \ncausing her to hit her head on the wall.6 \n \n \nA police officer contacted Applicant\u2019s wife on May 3, 2005, for a delayed \ndomestic violence call. She told the officer that on May 1, 2005, she and her husband \nwere arguing when he threw her down on the ground and up against the house. The \nofficer asked her how long the abuse had been going on and she stated \u201cthe last 23 \nyears.\u201d She was hesitant to provide a signed statement. She told the officer that \nApplicant was the primary income earner and they would lose everything if he lost his \njob. The officer provided her a written statement form and asked her to fill it out and \ndrop it off at the station. He contacted her later when she did not provide a written \nstatement and offered her the opportunity to provide a tape recorded statement. She \nrefused. There is no evidence that she ever provided a written or tape recorded \nstatement. Applicant was never arrested or charged for this incident. Both Applicant and \nhis wife denied any memory of this incident.7 Applicant testified: \n \nI never once drug my wife across my driveway in front of my house, ever. I \ndon\u2019t recall this. I don\u2019t remember this ever even happening. If it did \nhappen, I wasn\u2019t even present when the police were there or when my \nwife was taking anybody to the hospital or anything else. I am completely \noblivious to this.8 \n \nThe police report did not state that Applicant dragged his wife across their driveway in \nfront of their house. It only stated that \u201c[Applicant] threw her down on the ground and up \nagainst the house (which is made of brick).\u201d9 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on September 16, 2007, and charged with assault-\ndomestic violence and interference with communication. His wife told the police officer \nthat she and Applicant had been arguing for about two hours. He hit her arm with a \npillow. She got tired of his shouting so she was looking for the home phone. He got up \nand broke the home phone. She went into the bedroom and called the police on her cell \nphone. The officer summarized what occurred in the police report: \n \nOn 09/16/07 at 2353 I was dispatched to [address] in reference to a \ndomestic violence incident. Upon arrival I contacted [Applicant] who \nexplained to myself that on today\u2019s date him and his wife [wife\u2019s name] \nwere involved in an argument which began when [Applicant] woke up on \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 134-135, 144-147; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6; AE A-2, A-3. \n \n7 Tr. at 125-126, 132-133,147-148; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5. \n \n8 Tr. at 147-148. \n \n9 GE 5. \n \n\n \n5 \n \ntoday\u2019s date and decided he was going to steam clean his carpet and then \nclean up the rest of his house. He explained to me in detail in a very irate \nmanner how hard he had worked today cleaning his residence. After \n[Applicant] was finished explaining to myself about how hard he had \nworked to clean his residence, he further explained how he and his wife \nwere laying in bed at the end of this day and he wanted to spend time with \nhis wife, but she kept falling asleep because she was tired from working \nlong hours. [Applicant] became so irate that he hit his wife on her face with \na pillow. At this time [wife] stated that she wished to dial 911, but her \nhusband had dismantled the telephone and threw it in the trash. \n[Applicant] was very difficult to have a conversation with because he was \nso irate and belligerent about the fact that he had cleaned his residence \nand his wife was tired and could not stay awake to spend quality time with \nhim. At this time I placed [Applicant] under arrest for the listed charges. He \ncontinued to be very belligerent with me the entire time. He was \ntransported to [detention center] without further incident.10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife wrote a letter to the district attorney stating that she did not want to \npress charges against her husband. Charges were dismissed in February 2008.11 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was sleeping on the couch and his wife woke him up. \nHe admitted that he struck his wife with a pillow after she had struck him with a pillow. \nHe stated that he wanted to call the police but his wife would not let him, so he broke \nthe phone. His wife provided similar testimony and that he hit her in the face with the \npillow. Applicant commented at one point in the hearing that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know pillow \nfighting was illegal.\u201d12 He was asked if he struck his wife with the pillow in anger, and he \nanswered: \n \nIt was in retaliation for being struck with a pillow. I don\u2019t recall being angry, \nand if I was angry, I don\u2019t recall at what level I was angry. I had just been \nwoken off the couch by a woman that had been antagonizing me all day \nlong.13 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in September 2008. A \nsigned statement was not provided but the interview was memorialized in a report of \ninvestigation (ROI). DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the ROI in an interrogatory and \nasked him if the ROI accurately reflected the information he provided to the investigator \non the day he was interviewed. He was provided the opportunity to explain why the ROI \nwas inaccurate and to add additional information regarding the matters discussed \nduring the interview. He answered that the ROI was accurate and submitted additional \n                                                          \n10 GE 4. \n \n11 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A-5, A-6. \n \n12 Tr. at 118-124; 148-149. \n \n13 Tr. at 149.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \ninformation. The ROI indicates that Applicant gave the investigator a somewhat different \nversion of events. He and his wife were arguing for about three to four hours before he \nwas arrested. He tried to avoid the argument by going into different rooms of the house \nbut she pursued him. When he attempted to leave the house, she got in front of him and \nstarted yelling in his face. At that point he picked up a pillow off the couch and used it to \npush her from in front of him. This made her even angrier and she called the police. He \nrealized he could not leave with the police coming, but she continued to follow him \nthroughout the house yelling at him. He decided to call the police himself but she kept \ngrabbing the phone out of his hand. He then became angry and ripped the phone cord \nout of the wall. He also told the investigator that this was an isolated incident and he \nhad never hit his wife.14 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife accepted responsibility for most of Applicant\u2019s contacts with law \nenforcement. She stated that she was difficult when she did not take her medication. \nShe frequently called his command to complain about him being gone. She was angry \nabout their situation and frequently initiated fights. He would try and avoid fights. She \ndescribed him as a good man and a good father. She stated that Applicant has never \nstruck her with a closed fist or an open hand, and that when their fights turned physical \nthey \u201cmostly pushed and shoved each other.\u201d She admitted on one occasion he pushed \nher and she fell and hit her head. She denied that he kicked her but stated that he has \nused his foot to move her out of the way when he was trying to get away from her. She \nstated that she would sometimes lie to the police officers in order to get Applicant in \ntrouble.15 \n \n \nI did not find either Applicant or his wife to be credible witnesses. Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony was evasive and inconsistent at times. I further find that some of his \ntestimony was intentionally false. Of particular note was the testimony of Applicant and \nhis wife that they had no memory of the 1988 incident in Germany. That was the one \nincident that was witnessed by someone other than Applicant and his wife. It is not \nbelievable that neither party could remember him striking his pregnant wife while she \nwas holding their two-year-old child, causing her to fall to ground, and dragging her \nalong the side of the road. To the extent that Applicant or his wife\u2019s testimony varied \nfrom the account of events in the police reports, I find the facts to be as detailed in the \npolice reports. I further find that Applicant provided intentionally false or misleading \ninformation to the OPM investigator when he told the investigator that he had never hit \nhis wife.16 \n \n \nApplicant estimated that he has been through four or five anger management \nclasses while in the Army. Some of the classes were unrelated to his domestic violence \nissues but were connected with his dealings with other soldiers. He denied having any \n                                                          \n14 GE 2. \n \n15 Tr. at 84-85, 89, 99, 110, 115-116, 123, 134-137. \n \n16 It was not alleged in the SOR that falsified the OPM interview. Applicant\u2019s statements will not \nbe used for disqualification purposes. They will be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility; in the \napplication of mitigating conditions; and in evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \ndifficulty in controlling his anger. He and his wife have seen marriage counselors and he \nhas received counseling for his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to his \ncombat experiences. Applicant has not consumed alcohol since he was about 20 years \nold.17 \n \n \nApplicant earned many awards, decorations, and accolades while he was in the \nArmy, including the Meritorious Service Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, four \nArmy Achievement Medals, six Good Conduct Medals, and the Bronze Star Medal for \nexceptionally meritorious achievement during combat operations in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. His Army evaluation reports reflect excellent service. Four witnesses testified \non Applicant\u2019s behalf. His former first sergeant testified about Applicant\u2019s outstanding \nservice in Iraq. Three witnesses testified about Applicant\u2019s hard work and \nprofessionalism in his post-Army career.18  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n                                                          \n17 Tr. at 112-113, 117, 149-153. \n \n18 AE A-8 to A-14, A-24. \n\n \n8 \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s multiple instances of domestic violence, as established by the police \nreports, are sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n9 \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant was involved in six documented domestic violence incidents over the \ncourse of almost 20 years. The most recent incident was in September 2007. The \nbehavior was not infrequent and, under the circumstances, I find it to be recent. His \ncriminal acts cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n32(a) is not applicable. His counseling, education, military record, and good work record \nare positive signs of rehabilitation. However, his behavior has been recurrent over many \nyears. He gave false or misleading information to the OPM investigator in September \n2008, and he knowingly provided false testimony at his hearing. That is not evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. No mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s 20 years service in the Army, including multiple combat tours, and his very \nfavorable character evidence. I also considered the stressful and tragic events in his \nand his wife\u2019s life. His wife is obviously very troubled, with emotional and psychological \n\n \n10 \n \nproblems. I believe their testimony that she was the initiator of much of the arguments \nthat preceded the violence in their marriage. I also believe that she was an active \nparticipant in many of the events. That does not mean that Applicant is free from blame. \nNothing his pregnant wife did in 1988 could justify striking her while she was holding \ntheir two-year-old child, causing her to fall to ground, and dragging her along the side of \nthe road. That event was witnessed by two German women who took Applicant\u2019s wife \nand child to the hospital. The doctor noted that her clothing was dirty, in particular the \nback and buttock area, and that the two-year-old child kept stating that he was hit by his \ndaddy. Even though it occurred more than 20 years ago, it is simply not believable that \nneither Applicant nor his wife could remember such a traumatic event. Without complete \ncandor, it is impossible to find that Applicant is rehabilitated, and that such events are \nunlikely to recur. Serious doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s judgment, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Criminal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On August 29, 2007, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nA review of the record indicates that Applicant received the Government\u2019s File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on June 29, 2007.  She filed a timely response to the FORM, dated July 24, 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s response was a hand-written letter which described her efforts to work with her\ncreditors, and stated: \u201cI have proof for SOR #1a.  Here is a copy of the letter I received stating that\nmy IRS account is paid in full and there is nothing else owing.\u201d  The referenced attachment,\nhowever, does not appear in the file.  \nBy memorandum dated July 31, 2007, Department Counsel transmitted Applicant\u2019s response\nto the Administrative Judge stating that he had no objection to its admission into the record.  In that\nmemorandum he also stated: \u201cI do not see any new documents accompanying [Applicant\u2019s] letter\nof 7/24/07.\u201d  It is unclear from the record what, if any, efforts were made by Department Counsel\nor the Administrative Judge to ascertain whether the referenced documentation had been mistakenly\nseparated from Applicant\u2019s letter after its arrival at DOHA, or if any efforts were made to contact\nthe Applicant and otherwise resolve the issue.  In her appeal brief, Applicant states: \u201c . . .

However, given the language in Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM and Department\nCounsel\u2019s transmittal memorandum to the Administrative Judge, the Board cannot determine\nwhether Applicant submitted the attachment or not.  In this regard, the Board notes that Applicant\u2019s\nappeal brief states: \u201cEnclosed is a letter from the Internal Revenue Service describing my account\nas being \u2018paid in full\u2019 with a zero balance.

From 2000\nthrough 2006, she annually acquired delinquent debt which was left unaddressed. That debt now\namounts to almost $13,000, including about $2,000 in medical bills acquired while unemployed and\na tax lien. She denied having any delinquent debt or liens in completing her questionnaire for public\ntrust positions. Although she may not have deliberately concealed facts, she has otherwise failed to\nmitigated security concerns regarding her financial considerations and personal conduct. Eligibility\nfor positions designated ADP I/II/III is denied. \n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n1\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The procedural rules set out\nin the Directive for security clearance cases are applied to ADP trustworthiness determinations. The adjudicative\nguidelines set out in Department of Defense Regulation 5200-2R, Personnel Security Program (Jan. 1987), as amended\nand modified (Regulation), are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations. \n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary determination that\nshe was not eligible for assignment to information systems positions designated ADP I/II/III.  The\n1\nSOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and  Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct). Specifically, it alleges that she falsified material facts on a Questionnaire for\nPublic Trust Positions, Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), by denying she had a tax lien within the past\nseven years and for denying being 180-days or more past due on any loans or obligations. \nApplicant responded with a  notarized Answer to the SOR, dated April 9, 2007, in which she\nadmitted all allegations. In it, she also declined to request a hearing on the record. Consequently, the\nGovernment submitted its FORM, containing its argument and seven supporting items, on June 22,\n2007. Applicant received the FORM on June 29, 2007, and timely provided a response, dated July\n24, 2007. It described efforts to work with creditors and referred to a document showing that she had\npaid the debt designated in the SOR as 1.a. concerning a $7,121 tax lien. No such document is\ncontained in the official file with her response, and the Government noted on its receipt of the\nresponse \u201cI do not see any new documents accompanying the [Applicant\u2019s] letter of 7/24/07.\u201d The\ncase was assigned to me on August 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. After a\nthorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the following additional findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old appointment setter working for a defense contractor. She has\nworked for the same employer since April 2006. She returned to work after a year off living with her\nmother, and was a service associate for a health care provider for several years before that. She\nearned and received her high school diploma in 1987. Currently, she is a single mother with a nine-\nyear-old son.  \nLittle can be discerned about Applicant because she declined to have a hearing and because\nshe provided few facts for the record. Since 1993, she has had erratic employment. She was\nunemployed from November 2001 through September 2002, and again from September 2005\nthrough April 2006. A federal tax lien was imposed in about March 2004 for $7,121. She claims the\nlien obligation has been settled, but she failed to submit any evidence to support her claim. \nThe debts at issue became delinquent and were placed into collection between approximately\nNovember 2000 and November 2006. In terms of the number of debts, the majority were referred\n\n Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n2\n Regulation Appendix 8.\n3\n Id.\n4\n Id.\n5\n4\nfor collection in 2001-2002. This period approximately coincides with the time of Applicant\u2019s first\nperiod of unemployment. The total amount at issue is a little less than $13,000. Of the 17 debts, 8\nare for medical care provided for her asthmatic son while she was unemployed and which she\nthought had been paid by Medicaid; they amount to about $2,000. As for the rest, they went\ndelinquent because her income did not meet her obligations. \nIn explaining why she did not note either her tax lien or her delinquent debts (over 180 days)\non her SF-86P, Applicant set forth three explanations. First, regarding Guideline E, in general, she\nwrote in her response to the SOR: \u201cI did not correctly answer the question. It was not intentionally.\nI am trustworthy [sic] from my previous employers I had not breached my confidential information.\nI have dealt with a lot of information and I would never do any type of criminal act.\u201d Second, she\ncontinued, with regard to the tax lien, by stating: \u201cI am trustworthy. My tax account status was on\nhold until I was able to make payments again [sic] I was told to do a financial worksheet over the\nphone and I was over extended. I am filing for my taxes and I should have a small amount that I\nwould owe.\u201d Third, regarding her delinquencies, she wrote: \u201cIt was not intentionally [sic] the old\nmedical bills I had I thought were being paid from Medicaid [sic] I was told they would be back\ndated from the time I had applied and the other bills[.] I was not able to make payments on my\naccount due to my income situation.\u201d\nPOLICIES\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Regulation. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\u201d  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the personnel security\n2\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  Each eligibility\n3\ndetermination must be a fair, impartial, and commonplace decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation.4\nAn administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  The revised\n5\n\n Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n9\n Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n10\n AG \u00b6 18.\n11\n5\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions applicable to each specific guideline.  \nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  In security clearance cases,\n6\nthe Government initially must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.7\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\n8\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201cAny doubt as to\n9\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access\n10\nto sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F and Guideline E of the revised AG most pertinent\nto the evaluation of the facts in this case. For clarity, I will discuss the two separately: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or an inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.11\nIn this matter, the Government provided substantial evidence that Applicant has 17 unpaid,\ndelinquent debts. The balance owed is almost $13,000. Although no documentary evidence was\nintroduced, she claims she settled one debt, a tax lien. Her debts are multiple in number and most,\nif not all, remain unpaid. Therefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1,\nAG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 2, \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. Given this showing, the burden now shifts to Applicant to\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, to overcome the case against her. \n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n12\n Albeit with some explanation.\n13\n6\nOf the approximately $13,000 at issue, approximately $2,000 represents  medical debt. It was\nacquired providing essential medical care to address her son\u2019s severe asthma during a period when\nshe was unemployed. Consequently, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG\n\u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies to the essential\nmedical care provided while unemployed.\nThe majority of the debts were referred for collection between late 2000 and 2002. The most\nrecent were turned over for collection around November 2006. Taken as a whole, the debts noted\nin the SOR steadily grew in number with each passing year between November 2000 and November\n2006. Some debts were accrued during a period of unemployment; other debts were acquired while\nemployed, but on a salary or budget that did not satisfy all of her obligations. Given the more recent\nobligations, it cannot be said that Applicant\u2019s accrual of debt is a thing of the past or something\naberrational in her credit history. Given the fact she chose to have this review based solely on the\nrecord and has provided few, if any, additional facts for consideration, she has failed to show that\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\napplies.\nDespite two periods of unemployment and jobs yielding salaries which apparently could not\ncover her expenses, there is no indication she has sought credit counseling, assistance with money\nmanagement, or attempted debt consolidation of what appears to be a potentially manageable amount\nof debt. With so few facts offered, neither FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) nor FC MC 4, \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) can be found to apply.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.12\nIn its FORM, the Government emphasizes that it \u201calleged that Applicant deliberately failed\nto list her outstanding debts in her security clearance application in response to Questions 22(a) and\n(b),\u201d in its original SOR. It fails, however, to cite to a specific Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) as being applicable. It then states that although Applicant admitted to those\nallegations,  she failed to cite to a specific Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC).\n13\nConsequently, both parties have failed to provide the tribunal with guidance as to which, if any,\nconditions apply.\n\n7\nThe facts presented do not indicate an intentional or deliberate effort to omit, conceal, or\nfalsify, nor do they reflect a refusal to cooperate. Indeed, Applicant denies intentionally answering\nthe questions incorrectly. The available PC DCs, by and large, contemplate an intentional or\ndeliberate act, refusal, or concealment. Without guidance in the FORM or some indication of\nduplicity on the part of the Applicant, none of the PC DCs specifically apply. However, the scant facts\navailable do indicate that Applicant failed to provide complete answers on the SF-86P and was, in\nfact, confused as to the questions.\nPersonal Conduct security concerns can also arise from conduct involving questionable\njudgment and questionable reliability. It is apparent Applicant knew she had delinquent debts and she\nconcedes she was working on her tax lien. Based on this knowledge, and in the absence of any\nadditional facts from Applicant proving otherwise, she had an obligation to seek counsel from a\nsecurity officer or at least provide the minimal explanations she provided in response to the SOR.\nSuch information would have been sufficient to put investigators on notice of problem areas. Based\non the few facts presented here, neither the available PC MCs nor an analysis of the underlying\nsecurity concerns can mitigate this failure or the personal conduct exhibited.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis.\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. She\nis a mature woman and mother with a high school diploma and some experience in the insurance\nindustry. She has experienced minor financial problems which have manifested themselves in the\nannual accrual of additional debt to the extent that it now amounts to almost $13,000, a not\nunmanageable sum. She demonstrated few efforts to address the balance and stated she seldom had\nthe resources to do so. Similarly, she presented few facts and no documentary evidence upon which\nto consider her case more thoroughly. Based on the scant record provided, Applicant has failed to\nmitigate financial and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

She is a mature woman and mother with a high school diploma and some experience in the insurance industry. She experienced minor financial problems which eventually manifested themselves in the annual accrual of additional debt. Inasmuch as she has satisfied her tax lien, Applicant demonstrated that she repaid over half of the $13,000 cited in the SOR as raising concerns. She has not, however, shown any 12 Although approximately $2,000 was previously mitigated as unexpected medical necessity, that 13 does not excuse Applicant from her obligation for those debts.

Moreover, 13 Applicant has not provided any references as to whether she has received productive financial counseling, whether she is currently free of delinquent debt, or whether her current financial situation mitigates, rebuts, or extenuates the financial considerations concerns set forth in Guideline F. Consequently, financial concerns still remain. Furthermore, Applicant knew she had a tax lien and delinquent debts when she completed her April 2006 SF-85P form and certified that she had no such liens or debts.

MARSHALL, JR.\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nJohn Bayard Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 13, 2007, I was assigned the above-captioned case. A decision finding\nagainst Applicant based on both financial considerations and personal conduct was issued\non August 29, 2007. Applicant appealed the adverse decision to the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). The Appeal Board subsequently issued its decision on\nDecember 27, 2007. \nIn its decision, the Appeal Board stated it found the record unclear as to what efforts\nwere made by Department Counsel or the undersigned to ascertain what happened to a\n\n In her response to the FORM, Applicant wrote \u201cI have proof for SOR #1a. Here is a copy of the letter\n1\nI received stating that my IRS account is paid in full and there is nothing else owing.\u201d SOR #1a states: \u201cYou\nare indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in the approximate amount of $7,121.00 on a federal tax lien\nentered in about March 2004. As of February 9, 2007, this debt has not yet been paid.\u201d Department Counsel\nhandwrote on the bottom of the Legal Assistant\u2019s July 31, 2007, memorandum: \u201cI do not see any new\ndocuments accompanying Ms. Alexander;\u2019s letter of 7/24/07.\u201d In my initial decision, I noted both Department\nCounsel\u2019s comment and my assessment that the referenced letter was neither attached to the response nor\ncontained elsewhere in the official file.\n In its assessment of the matter, the Appal Board notes that, in her appeal brief, Applicant again\n2\nreferenced enclosure of an IRS letter, as well as a letter from an unemployment agency. It concluded,\nhowever, that only two pages from a state employment and training agency were attached to her materials.\n See Order of January 10, 2008.\n3\n See Department Counsel\u2019s Response to Decision of Administrative Judge, dated January 17, 2008.\n4\n2\ncertain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) letter referenced by Applicant in her July 24, 2007,\nresponse to the File of Relevant Materials (FORM).  Department Counsel had noted that\n1\nthe letter was not included with Applicant\u2019s materials when the case file was being\nprepared for assignment to a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The Appeal Board remanded\n2\nthe matter to me, broadly stating \u201cthe Administrative Judge is permitted to reopen the\nrecord as appropriate, to resolve any outstanding issues.\u201d\nUpon receipt of the remand, I reviewed the record in this case and my earlier\ndecision. On January 10, 2008, I issued an order directing Department Counsel to fully\ninvestigate the issue as to what happened or may have happened to the IRS letter at issue,\nand to report to me any information or deductions.  On January 17, 2008, Department\n3\nCounsel submitted his response to the January 10, 2008, order.  After reviewing the\n4\ngeneral procedures used in the preparation of FORMs, responses to those FORMs, and\nthe processes leading to the forwarding of completed case files for assignment to a DOHA\nAdministrative Judge, as well as the statements of the Legal Assistant who prepared this\nspecific case file, Department Counsel again noted that the referenced IRS letter was\nneither attached to Applicant\u2019s materials nor included in the case files. He also echoed my\nassessment that there was no sign of a staple, paper clip, or other attempt to append any\ndocuments to Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM.\nBased on the above investigation and assessment, Department Counsel stated that\nhe believed there were only two explanations for the missing IRS letter: First, as suggested\nby the Appeal Board, that the IRS Letter was separated from Applicant\u2019s July 24, 2007,\nresponse to the FORM after its arrival at DOHA. Second, that the Applicant mistakenly\nomitted the IRS letter from the package she sent to DOHA. \nWith regard to the first explanation, Department Counsel noted his assessment that\nthis explanation is highly unlikely given the Legal Assistant\u2019s reputation for highly efficient\nand methodical work. Further, he noted that it is most likely the Legal Assistant hand\ndelivered her July 31, 2007, memorandum directly to him and that she sits 15 feet from his\noffice. Department Counsel surmised that \u201cit is highly unlikely that she mistakenly\nseparated the IRS letter from Applicant\u2019s response and then lost it, while at the same time\n\n Department Counsel further states: \u201cIt also appears that Applicant\u2019s Appeal brief/letter, dated\n5\nSeptember 26, 2007, also purports to enclose a copy of the same IRS letter for the Appeal Board\u2019s\nconsideration. The copy of this brief/letter provided by the [Appeal Board Chairman] to Chief Department\nCounsel, dated September 27, 2007, does not include a copy of this IRS Letter as an attachment to\nApplicant\u2019s brief/letter. The Board\u2019s decision in this case . . . similarly reflects that Applicant\u2019s brief/letter did\nnot include a copy of the IRS Letter, as indicated by Applicant in her brief/letter. . . . It seems that Applicant\nmade the same mistake on two occasions.\u201d \n Notice No. CP49, \u201cOverpaid Tax Applied ot Other Taxes You Owe\u201d. \n6\n3\nshe managed to copy properly the other documents Applicant sent with her response . .\n. and to file the original in the Orange File and the copies in the Purple File.\u201d He also noted,\nas previously mentioned, the lack of evidence of any staples or paper clips having been\nused to attach any documents to the response.  In conclusion, in light of the procedures\n5\nused and the available facts, Department Counsel suggested that the second explanation\nwas the correct one. \nDepartment Counsel also forwarded a copy of a May 7, 2007, IRS document he\nobtained from Applicant during his investigation.  That IRS notice is the letter Applicant\n6\nmeant to include in her response to the FORM. It reflects that an IRS action had recouped\n$2,920.97 from Applicant\u2019s tax refund amount of $3,428.00 for tax year ending 2006 in\norder to satisfy taxes owed from tax year ending December 31, 2001. As a result of that\naction, the notice indicated Applicant had a zero balance owed for the tax period ending\nDecember 31, 2001. Upon review of Department Counsel\u2019s  investigation and the proffered\nIRS document, I issued an order on January 24, 2008, directing Department Counsel to\nforward my January 24, 2008, order and permit Applicant to respond or comment on these\nmatters within seven calendar days. On January 29, 2008, he forwarded my order to\nApplicant and suggested she clarify her suggestion that the IRS\u2019 application of $2,920.97\nin May 2007 satisfied the entire $7,121 tax lien noted in the SOR at 1.a.\nIn Applicant\u2019s February 5, 2008, response to my January 24, 2008 order and\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s suggestion for further clarification, she stated that the original lien\namount of $7,121.00 was incorrect. She stated it had been reduced over time by\ninstallment payments. Through this method, Applicant had made monthly payments to\nreduce her balances owed and tax refunds owed were applied to her tax lien obligation\nbalance. .\nTo support her statement, Applicant offered illustrative evidence showing that, as\nof July 11, 2005, her total beginning tax liability for December 31, 1995, through December\n31, 2002, was approximately $7,385.93. Her proffer further showed that during that period,\nshe submitted $1,725.60 in payments toward her total obligation. Her ending balance on\nJuly 11, 2005, was $4,976.60 for those tax years, of which; $3,874.08 was shown owed\nfor tax period ending December 31, 2001 and the balance owed for tax years 1995 and\n2002. The May 2007 IRS recoupment satisfied the amount owed for 2001 and intervening\npayments after July 11, 2005, apparently satisfied the minor sums owed for 1995 and\n2002. Consequently, Applicant showed that her tax liability, as cited in SOR 1.a, was\nsatisfied.\n\n Neither party expressed objection(s) to the documents submitted.\n7\n It is also noted that Applicant offered no new facts or exhibits indicating she has sought financial\n8\ncounseling or showing her current financial situation. \n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18.\n9\n4\nDECISION\nAfter confirming that the thorough procedures cited by Department Counsel\naccurately portrayed those procedures used in the preparation of FORM cases in which\nan applicant declines the opportunity for a hearing on the record, I thoroughly considered\nboth Department Counsel\u2019s report and the extraneous facts regarding what happened to\nthe referenced IRS letter. Next, I again searched the record for any indication that the IRS\nstatement was ever in the case file and again noted the lack of evidence that any\ndocuments to the Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM had been physically appended.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s exact language regarding the absence of any attachments in his\ncomments to the Legal Assistant on her memorandum, dated July 31, 2007, was then\nreexamined. Based on the above, I concur with Department Counsel\u2019s assessment and\nconclude that, as a result of simple error, the IRS letter did not originally accompany\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM. \nBecause this omission of the May 2007 IRS letter was the result of unintentional\nerror, and given the Appeal Board\u2019s invitation to reopen the record to resolve any\noutstanding issues, I now include within the record both Department Counsel\u2019s and\nApplicant\u2019s narratives and the documents received in response to my orders of January 10,\n2008, and January 4, 2008.  The record is now closed.\n7\nBased on the information and exhibits now of record, and in light of both the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s broad language in remanding the matter and judicial economy, I have\nreconsidered the matter. Applicant\u2019s satisfaction of the tax lien noted in SOR allegation 1.a\nis acknowledged as satisfied, Applicant\u2019s explanations regarding her negative answers\nregarding obligations on her SF-85P, and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\napplicable to Guidelines F and E are reconsidered below in view of this additional finding.8\nAll other prior findings as to the facts, policies, and discussion contained in my original\ndecision and not conflicting with this new evidence and explanation are affirmed.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  In this matter,\n9\nthe Government provided substantial evidence that Applicant had 17 unpaid, delinquent\ndebts amounting to about $13,000 accrued over several years. Therefore, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n10\n5\nto satisfy debts) and FC DC 2, \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nGiven this showing, the burden now shifts to Applicant to present evidence of refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation, to overcome the case against her. \nThe majority of the debts cited in the SOR were referred for collection between late\n2000 and 2002. The most recent obligations cited were turned over for collection around\nNovember 2006. Taken as a whole, the debts noted in the SOR steadily grew in number\nwith each passing year between November 2000 and November 2006. Some debts were\naccrued during a period of unemployment; other debts were acquired while employed, but\non a salary or budget that did not satisfy all of her obligations. Given the more recent\nobligations, it cannot be said that Applicant\u2019s accrual of debt is a thing of the past or\nsomething aberrational in her credit history. Based on the scant facts provided, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply. Moreover, despite two periods of unemployment and jobs\nyielding salaries which apparently could not cover her expenses, no facts are in the record\nto show she has sought credit counseling as a method of better handling her obligations\nand budgeting her future income. Consequently, FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nOf the approximately $13,000 at issue, approximately $2,000 represents medical\ndebt acquired providing essential medical care to address her son\u2019s severe asthma during\na period when she was unemployed. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances) applies to these specific medical obligations, although it is notable that\nthere is no indication whether Applicant has responsibly addressed these debts since the\ntime they were acquired. Additionally, Applicant has demonstrated that the tax lien cited\nat SOR 1.a regarding approximately $7,121 has been repaid through an installment plan\nand an IRS recoupment, giving rise to FC MC 4, \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Of the approximately\n$13,000 at issue in the SOR, a little over $9,000 has been mitigated or shown to be repaid,\nleaving approximately $4,000 unaddressed.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  In her response to\n10\nthe FORM, Applicant admitted the allegations under Guideline E that she denied having\na tax lien or delinquent debts (over 180 days) on her SF-85P despite the fact she had a tax\n\n In response to questions inquiring whether she had been subject to a tax lien in the preceding seven\n11\nyears [SF-85P Question 22(a)] or was then 180 days or more delinquent on any loan or financial obligations\n(SF-85P Question 22(b)], Applicant answered \"No.\" \n The amount referenced is the sum paid off to satisfy the $7,121 tax lien cited in the SOR.\n12\n6\nlien and multiple delinquent obligations.  As noted in my original decision, Applicant set\n11\nforth three explanations. First, regarding Guideline E, in general, she wrote: \u201cI did not\ncorrectly answer the question. It was not intentionally,\u201d then referred to her work record.\nSecond, with regard to the tax lien, she stated: \u201cI am trustworthy. My tax account status\nwas on hold until I was able to make payments again [sic] I was told to do a financial\nworksheet over the phone and I was over extended. I am filing for my taxes and I should\nhave a small amount that I would owe.\u201d Third, regarding her other delinquencies, she only\naddressed the above-referenced medical obligations. Regarding those debts, she wrote:\n\u201cIt was not intentionally [sic] the old medical bills I had I thought were being paid from\nMedicaid [sic] I was told they would be back dated from the time I had applied and the\nother bills[.] I was not able to make payments on my account due to my income situation.\u201d\nGuideline E is primarily predicated on issues involving deliberate falsity, an element\nfound lacking in the original decision. Personal conduct concerns can also arise, however,\nfrom conduct involving questionable judgment and questionable reliability. Applicant\nadmitted she was \u201con hold\" in repaying her tax lien when she completed her SF-85P. Her\nmost recent submissions clearly show that she was otherwise addressing that lien both\nbefore and after she completed the SF-85P. Consequently, she knew she had a tax lien\nand she knew she had a balance owed toward that tax obligation when she completed that\nquestionnaire. She chose, however, not to disclose that fact on the form. Moreover, while\nshe may have been confused as to her liability for certain medical bills, there is no\nindication that she diligently and properly sought the advice or counsel of a security\nmanager, a supervisor, or a colleague before certifying that her SF-85P answers were true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of her knowledge. Furthermore, she failed to identify or\nreference the other delinquent accounts at issue on her questionnaire. As a result, known\nobligations were not included on the SF-85P and investigators were given no notice of their\nexistence. Such a situation both vexes and undermines the investigative process. It also\nraises serious questions regarding Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Based on the few\nfacts presented here, none of the available Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept. She is a mature woman and mother with a high school diploma and some\nexperience in the insurance industry. She experienced minor financial problems which\neventually manifested themselves in the annual accrual of additional debt. Inasmuch as\nshe has satisfied her tax lien, Applicant demonstrated that she repaid over half of the\n$13,000 cited in the SOR as raising concerns.  She has not, however, shown any\n12\n\n Although approximately $2,000 was previously mitigated as unexpected medical necessity, that\n13\ndoes not excuse Applicant from her obligation for those debts. \n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n15\n Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n16\n7\nprogress made toward paying off the remaining balance of her obligations.  Moreover,\n13\nApplicant has not provided any references as to whether she has received productive\nfinancial counseling, whether she is currently free of delinquent debt, or whether her\ncurrent financial situation mitigates, rebuts, or extenuates the financial considerations\nconcerns set forth in Guideline F. Consequently, financial concerns still remain. \nFurthermore, Applicant knew she had a tax lien and delinquent debts when she\ncompleted her April 2006 SF-85P form and certified that she had no such liens or debts.\nIndeed, evidence recently submitted and admitted on remand shows that her efforts toward\nsatisfying her tax lien had been an on-going process. That evidence also shows that she\nfinished her incremental satisfaction of this tax obligation by May 2007. Additionally,\nalthough she may have been confused with regard to her son\u2019s emergency medical bills,\nshe has provided no reason why she failed to mention her other delinquent debts on the\nform. To specifically deny liens and obligations under these circumstances not only calls\ninto question one\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, but also raises serious concerns under\nGuideline E. \nAn applicant in an ADP determination is responsible for presenting evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  She \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n14\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\u201d her\nsecurity clearance.  \u201cAny doubt is to be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Here,\n15\n16\ndistinct doubts remain under two independent guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate\nconcerns arising under both Guideline E and Guideline F regarding her eligibility for\nassignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility for positions designated ADP I/II/III is denied. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):                  AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility\nfor positions designated ADP I/II/III is denied.\n                                                _____________________\nArthur E. Marshall, Jr.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "discussion": "contained in my original decision and not conflicting with this new evidence and explanation are affirmed. Guideline F, Financial Considerations Failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. In this matter, 9 the Government provided substantial evidence that Applicant had 17 unpaid, delinquent debts amounting to about $13,000 accrued over several years. Therefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness AG \u00b6 15. 10 5 to satisfy debts) and FC DC 2, \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. Given this showing, the burden now shifts to Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, to overcome the case against her. The majority of the debts cited in the SOR were referred for collection between late 2000 and 2002. The most recent obligations cited were turned over for collection around November 2006. Taken as a whole, the debts noted in the SOR steadily grew in number with each passing year between November 2000 and November 2006. Some debts were accrued during a period of unemployment; other debts were acquired while employed, but on a salary or budget that did not satisfy all of her obligations. Given the more recent obligations, it cannot be said that Applicant\u2019s accrual of debt is a thing of the past or something aberrational in her credit history. Based on the scant facts provided, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Moreover, despite two periods of unemployment and jobs yielding salaries which apparently could not cover her expenses, no facts are in the record to show she has sought credit counseling as a method of better handling her obligations and budgeting her future income. Consequently, FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply. Of the approximately $13,000 at issue, approximately $2,000 represents medical debt acquired providing essential medical care to address her son\u2019s severe asthma during a period when she was unemployed. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies to these specific medical obligations, although it is notable that there is no indication whether Applicant has responsibly addressed these debts since the time they were acquired. Additionally, Applicant has demonstrated that the tax lien cited at SOR 1.a regarding approximately $7,121 has been repaid through an installment plan and an IRS recoupment, giving rise to FC MC 4, \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good- faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Of the approximately $13,000 at issue in the SOR, a little over $9,000 has been mitigated or shown to be repaid, leaving approximately $4,000 unaddressed. Guideline E, Personal Conduct Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. In her response to 10 the FORM, Applicant admitted the allegations under Guideline E that she denied having a tax lien or delinquent debts (over 180 days) on her SF-85P despite the fact she had a tax In response to questions inquiring whether she had been subject to a tax lien in the preceding seven 11 years [SF-85P Question 22(a)] or was then 180 days or more delinquent on any loan or financial obligations (SF-85P Question 22(b)], Applicant answered \"No.\" The amount referenced is the sum paid off to satisfy the $7,121 tax lien cited in the SOR. 12 6 lien and multiple delinquent obligations. As noted in my original decision, Applicant set 11 forth three explanations. First, regarding Guideline E, in general, she wrote: \u201cI did not correctly answer the question. It was not intentionally,\u201d then referred to her work record. Second, with regard to the tax lien, she stated: \u201cI am trustworthy. My tax account status was on hold until I was able to ",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On February 1,\n\n2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On May 31, 2007, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndetermination.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant explains the causes of his financial situation and his attempts\nto improve it.  Applicant argues that the Judge should have found that his financial situation was\nmitigated.  He alleges bias on the part of the Judge, and he  cites a factual error on the part of the\nJudge.  Applicant states that because of a comment by someone in the security office, he misjudged\nthe seriousness of the trustworthiness determination process and therefore did not hire an attorney\nor submit documentary evidence.  He believes that some financial information he submitted to an\ninterviewer may not have reached the interviewer.  Applicant notes that the Judge\u2019s decision does\nnot mention an interviewer\u2019s report.  He nevertheless believes that the interviewer\u2019s report may have\ninfluenced the Judge\u2019s decision, and he believes that he should have been able to review the report\nand rebut its contents.  Applicant also points out that he has no access to classified information.  In\nlight of the above, Applicant requests remand of his case to the Judge.\nAs stated above, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief contains an explanation of the source of his\nfinancial difficulties and his attempts to improve his financial record.  To the extent that the\nexplanation contains information not presented before the Judge reviewed the record, it cannot be\nconsidered on appeal, since the Board is not allowed to consider new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.\nIn his response to the government\u2019s SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged debts.  His\nadmissions established the government\u2019s case.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts he admitted.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain\na favorable trustworthiness determination rested with Applicant.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant\nprovided some information about the origin of his financial difficulties in his responses to the SOR\nand to the file of relevant material (FORM).  In her decision, the Judge referred to the information\nApplicant provided.  The Judge stated she was not able to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial\nsituation was mitigated because Applicant provided neither sufficient information nor corroboration\nfor his assertions.  Applicant contends that the Judge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s\nmitigating evidence.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case\nNo. 06-13629 at 3 (Sep. 4, 2007).\nApplicant\u2019s assertion of factual error as to the age of Applicant\u2019s debts is not entirely clear.\nEven if we accept Applicant\u2019s argument on this point, the error would be harmless.  Considering the\ndecision as a whole, it is unlikely that clarification of the point in question would lead to a different\nresult.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-29143 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2005).\n   \n\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s allegation of bias, there is a rebuttable presumption that quasi-\njudicial officials are unbiased and impartial, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a\nheavy burden on appeal.  When the Board considers a claim of bias, the standard is not whether the\nappealing party personally believed that the Judge was biased.  Rather, the standard is whether the\nrecord contains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a disinterested person\nto question the fairness or impartiality of the judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-12361 at 3 (App.\nBd. Oct. 31, 2005).  In this case, Applicant offers no explanation for his claim of bias other than the\nJudge\u2019s failure to apply mitigating factors as he believes they should be applied.  The Board finds\nno indication of bias.\nApplicant received explanations of DOHA\u2019s procedures and a copy of the Directive.  He was\nadvised that an unfavorable decision could result in loss of his job and that he could hire an attorney\nif he wanted one.  Applicant states that an employee in the Defense Manpower Data Center security\noffice told him that she had \u201cnever seen anything come of these.\u201d  If Applicant chose, as he suggests,\nto limit his responses based on that comment, he cannot ascribe error to the Judge for his failure to\nparticipate fully.\nApplicant refers to contact he had with an interviewer.  He states that he slipped information\nunder the interviewer\u2019s door and is not sure whether the interviewer received the information.\nAlthough the Judge\u2019s decision does not reference a report from the interviewer, Applicant believes\nthe Judge may have been negatively influenced by such a report and argues that he should have been\nallowed to read the report and rebut its contents.  Applicant requested that his case be determined\non the written record.  Therefore, the Judge based her trustworthiness decision on the FORM and\nApplicant\u2019s response to it.  The FORM does not contain an interviewer\u2019s report.  Applicant was\ngiven the opportunity to respond to the FORM before it was delivered to the Judge, and he did\nsubmit a response.  Any information Applicant wanted the Judge to consider, he should have\nsubmitted as part of his response.  Applicant\u2019s arguments about  an interviewer\u2019s report are\nspeculative and without merit.\nFinally, Applicant points out that he has no access to classified information.  In accordance\nwith the memorandum of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense dated August 30, 2006, the\nAdjudicative Guidelines \u201capply to all adjudications and other determinations made under DoD\nDirective 5220.6.\u201d\nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments constitutes harmful error.  The Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination is sustainable.  \n\n   \nORDER\nThe determination of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems\nin ADP I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\n      \nSigned: Jean E.

As required by the Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan.\n1987), as amended (Regulation) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 1, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  In a sworn statement dated February 16, 2007,\n1\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations. Applicant elected to have his case decided on the\nwritten record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM)\non March 23, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on March 28, 2007, and received on April\n10, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided additional information and it was received on April\n25, 2007. Department Counsel had no objections. The case was assigned to me on May 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 60 years old and has been employed by a federal contractor as a business\nmanager since 2005. He is a college graduate with a master\u2019s in business administration. Applicant\nwas unemployed from January 2005 to July 2005. He is divorced and has two children. \nApplicant admitted the delinquent debts alleged in SOR 1.a. and 1.b. The debt in SOR 1.a\nis a state tax lien in the approximate amount of $69,541 for tax year 2001. The tax lien was filed in\nFebruary 2004. Applicant has a second state tax lien in the amount of approximately $39,905, which\nwas filed in November 2006. This tax lien was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered\nfor disqualifying purposes.  However, it will be considered when accessing Applicant\u2019s ability to\nrepay his debts and when analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d  The debt in SOR 1.b. is a debt to the\n2\nInternal Revenue Service in the approximate amount of $100,000 for tax year 2001. Applicant does\nnot dispute the debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b. \nApplicant\u2019s sworn statement attributes these debts to the following factors: (1) a business he\nowned and was trying to keep solvent so he used funds from his personal accounts; (2) his wife\u2019s\n\nAnswer.\n3\nGE 4.\n4\nAnswer.\n5\nResponse to Form.\n6\nAnswer.\n7\nSee FN 2.\n8\n4\nincreased spending in 1998 for three years; (3) the stock market and margin calls, which created\ntaxable events; (4) he had \u201cnearly\u201d no income until he obtained his present job in August 2006.3\nApplicant did not provide any amplifying information as to the causes of his financial\ndifficulties. He listed in his trustworthiness application that he started work for his present employer\nin July 2005.  He lists he was unemployed for a period in 2005, but also lists he was employed from\n4\nDecember 2003 to December 2004, as a vice president of operations for a company, and was\nemployed as the owner of his own business from 1998 to 2003. However he also states he closed the\nbusiness in 2001.  Without amplification, his information is conflicting.  \n5\nApplicant stated he contacted his state tax office and the IRS several times since 2002, but\ndid not elaborate as when he did this and what transpired, if anything. He stated he recently contacted\nthem both, but claimed they did not reply. He spoke with an accountant the day before he provided\nhis answer to the SOR. He stated he presented an offer to compromise, but did not state whether the\noffer was to the state or the IRS. He stated he had presented an offer to compromise to the IRS 18\nmonths ago and it was rejected for procedural reasons. He failed to explain what he did in response\nto that rejection. In his answer to the FORM, he stated both his state and federal tax liens were still\noutstanding, but he is current on his personal and his business taxes for 2003-2006. He stated this\nwas a prerequisite for filing an offer to compromise. He further stated: \u201cI still have a couple of non-\nmonetary prerequisites to satisfy before I can file a [state] or federal [offer to compromise] for 2001\nand 2002.\u201d  He did not explain what those prerequisites were and when and if he was going to satisfy\n6\nthem. Applicant did not provide any documentation as to his efforts to resolve these tax debts. He\nalso did not provide any information to show what caused his financial problems and what actions\nhe took to minimize or mitigate the problems. He did not provide any information as to why it has\ntaken more than six years for him to take more than nominal action on his tax debts. \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR 1.c, however he did admit that he is indebted to the\ncreditor\u2019s affiliate and was making payments.  In his answer to the FORM he stated he has now\n7\nsatisfied the debt, but failed to provide any documentation to support the payment. \nIn addition to the second state tax lien not alleged Applicant states in his answer to the\nFORM that he has two credit card debts totaling $20,000. He paid off one and owes $10,000 on the\nremaining credit card.  This debt will only be considered for purposes of analyzing Applicant\u2019s\n8\nability to repay his delinquent debts and in a whole person analysis. \n\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n9\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n10\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n11\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n12\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n13\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n14\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines 2(a).\n15\n5\nPOLICIES\nThe revised adjudicative guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.9\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n10\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n11\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n12\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  The\n13\nrevised adjudicative guidelines set for potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the\nadjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.14\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n15\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n16\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n16\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n17\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n18\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n19\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n20\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n21\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n22\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n23\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n24\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\n\n7\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has more than $169,000 in delinquent tax debts from 2001.\nHe did not provide any information as to why he did not address the debts sooner or how he is going\nto pay them. He did not provide any information of his financial resources or specifically how he got\ninto deep financial trouble. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), and FC MC.20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts\nare recent and remain unpaid. Applicant failed to provide any mitigating evidence as to how he was\ngoing to pay the debts and assurances that it is unlikely to recur. The tax debts are years old and no\nsubstantive proof was provided to show what Applicant has done in the past or how he intends on\nresolving the debts. Therefore, FC MC 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant alludes to problems he encountered that may have been beyond his control, but\nfailed to elaborate or provide any substantiating documentation. He alludes to the stock market and\nmargin calls as being a problem, but failed to provide how his finances were affected. Both of these\nfinancial endeavors are fraught with risk and those involved with them take on the risks with the hope\nof financial reward, but also the risk of serious financial loss. Although the result of what happens\nin the stock market and margin calls are beyond an investor\u2019s control, the willingness to take the risk\nis totally within their control. I do not find that condition is beyond a person\u2019s control. Applicant also\nalluded to being unemployed and underemployed, but again failed to elaborate. Applicant has had a\nsignificant number of years to address his financial problems and failed to offer any substantiation\nfor his failure to address them. The debt he claimed he paid, he failed to provide documentation that\nit is satisfied. He apparently has remaining prerequisites to abide by in order to make an offer to\ncompromise, but again he did not elaborate as to what they were. He simply failed to provide\nsubstantive mitigating evidence. I find FC MC 20(b) and (d) do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\n\n8\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the Directive\nto be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Specifically these are:\n(1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent\nto which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of\na particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the Guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. Applicant has more than $169,000 in\ndelinquent tax debts as listed in the SOR. He has an additional $39,000 in tax debts and $10,000 in\ncredit card debts he owes. These additional debts affect his ability to pay those listed in the SOR. He\nhas not provided documentation on his efforts to repay, an explanation as to specifically how he got\ninto financial problems, or a plan for how he will repay his delinquent debts. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to meet his burden and mitigate the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility\nis denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She has two delinquent debts for 2002 and 2003, which\nresulted from a divorce, a home business , and periods of unemployment.  Applicant thought she\nused a legal method to resolve the debts in 2002 and 2003, but discovered she made an honest\nmistake as to the efficacy of a debt elimination \u201cprogram\u201d she purchased from a vendor.  However,\nshe mitigated the financial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct trustworthiness\nconcerns.  Her eligibility for a trustworthiness position is granted.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On March 12, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines of the Directive issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nMarch 30, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 20, 2007.  \nOn August 6, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The\nGovernment submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant\ntestified in her case.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until August 20, 2007,\nfor the submission of exhibits.  I received them in a timely manner.  The Department had no\nobjection, so I marked them as Exhibits A to E, and admitted them into evidence.  DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 57 years old, divorced after 31 years of marriage, and works for a defense\ncontractor in the computer business.  Her current employer evaluates her as dependable and\nconscientious.  She had periods of unemployment from August 1999 to July 2000, then November\n2001 to October 2002, and November 2004 to April 2005.  She was divorced in 2002. (Tr. 12, 41,\n42, 53; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant paid her bills and mortgage while married.  She and her former husband had credit\ncards for 20 years and paid them in full.  While unemployed, and moving around the U.S. between\n2002 and 2006, to work on various contractual jobs, she borrowed money from her family upon\nwhich to live.  She repaid the $3,000 she borrowed from her mother, and the $5,000 she  borrowed\nfrom her father after 2005.  She continues to owe her sister $3,000, but her sister declines repayment.\nApplicant is committed to repaying that loan also.  Applicant\u2019s credit record shows all credit card\nand other debts as paid in full or current, except for two credit card debts owed to two banks.  The\nfirst delinquent debt is for $11,487.  The other delinquent debt is for $9,532.  These debts date from\n\n4\n2002 when Applicant had a home business and was being divorced. (Tr. 15, 16, 19, 32, 41; Exhibits\n2-5)\nApplicant ceased paying these two accounts in 2002.  She paid $2,000 to obtain debt\nelimination \u201cprogram\u201d materials (CDs, books, course materials) from a company to learn how to get\nrid of these two debts.  She sent letters using the \u201cprogram\u201d suggested formats to the two creditors,\nwhich letters stated, in part, \n\u201cI am disputing the amount because I believe that (the bank) failed to credit my account for\nmoney or credits accepted from me.  I believe that (the bank) accepted my signed note(s) and\nother promises to pay into new bank money and credits, but failed to disclose those material\nfacts to me.  I believe that I am entitled to receive these new credits or (the bank) would be\nreceiving something for nothing, while profiting from my fruit (sic) and labor.\u201d  \nThe form letter demanded the creditor bank provide an affidavit that it did not follow Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles, did not follow Federal Reserve Bank policies and procedures, that\nthe bank \u201cprohibits the party that funds the loan or extension of credit to be repaid,\u201d and that the\nbank \u201cdisclosed to me that they would create new money based on my note or similar instrument\nand that I am not entitled to those credits or money.\u201d  The letter then referred to the Fair Credit\nReporting Act. (Tr. 17, 21, 31, 33, 35-39, 43; Exhibits 2-5, B-E) \nAnother form letter Applicant used cited 15 U.S. C. \u00a71666 as authority for Applicant not\nrepaying these debts.  That section of the U.S. Code provides procedures for correcting billing errors\non credit card statements.  Applicant believes that because the banks did not contact her, the debts\nwere eliminated and closed.  One creditor sent her a IRS Form 1099-c for tax year 2006 for $8,502\nin cancelled debt,  of the original $11,487 listed in the SOR.  Applicant paid tax for 2006 on that\namount as income.  Applicant does not have the CDs or other materials from the \u201cprogram.\u201d (Tr.\n17, 21, 31, 33, 35-39, 43; Exhibits 2-5, B-E) \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits contained copies of the form letters and the letters she sent to the two\nbanks.  The justifications and statutes  listed by Applicant in these form letters are not valid legal\nbases for avoiding repayment of debt when she merely ceased paying the debts.  However, Applicant\nhonestly believes she was following a legitimate \u201cprogram\u201d to rid herself of these two debts.  She\ndoes not intend to repay these debts because she does not believe she owes them.  Applicant could\nnot remember where she obtained the $2,000 to buy the debt elimination \u201cprogram\u201d while\ncontinuing to owe these two credit cards. (Tr. 17, 21, 31, 33, 35-39, 43; Exhibits 2-5, B-E)\nApplicant did not list these two debts on her public trust application form (PTA) she\ncompleted on March 9, 2006, because she believed they were closed and did not have to be paid.\nShe did not consider them as debts.  She knew they were on her credit report at the time she\ncompleted the PTA.  Question 22.b. on the PTA form requested an Applicant disclose any\ndelinquent debts currently more than 180 days past due.  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to that question.\n(Tr. 37-39; Exhibit 1)\nPOLICIES\n\n5\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because\neach case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\n\n6\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \u00b618\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b615\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \u00b630\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (Regulation\n\u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.  DoD\ncontractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive. (Regulation\n\u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F:  Applicant owed two credit card debts in 2002.  While undergoing a painful\ndivorce, and some unemployment, Applicant sought and found an advertised as legitimate way to\nrid herself of these two sizeable debts.  Examining the exhibits offered by Applicant, it is clear to\nme that the arguments and reasons cited in the \u201cprogram\u201d letters are not legal, but are fallacious and\ndelusive.  Nonetheless, Applicant in her naivete and legal ignorance, paid $2,000 for this instruction\nprogram and thought she had rid herself of these two debts.  On creditor cancelled the debt in 2006\nand Applicant had to pay the tax on that income.  That debt (Subparagraph 1.a of the SOR) does not\nexist now because of the cancellation.  The other debt continues to exist.  Applicant and her former\n\n7\nhusband had a history of paying debts, according to her testimony, which I find believable, and the\ncredit reports submitted as exhibits.\nThe disqualifying condition applicable is Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n(DC) \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).  Applicant was unable at the time to pay\nthe debt.  Now she honestly believes that the debt is not owed.  \nApplicant had financial difficulties in 2002, resulting from her divorce and unemployment.\nHer record of paying her current bills and responsibly managing her money in the past and present\nweighs heavily in her favor.  Her honest belief in the correctness of the actions she took also count\nin her favor.  The actions were five years ago and have not been repeated.  Her debt problems in\n2002 and 2003 were contrary to the record of payments on debts she made before and after that\nperiod of time.  She thought she was using a legal method to dispute her debts and resolve them\nthrough that process.  She was mistaken, but no one told her that at the time, nor apparently until the\nhearing on this issue was any dispute about the legitimacy of that \u201cprogram\u201d brought to her\nattention.\nShe relied on the representations and information sold to her by this \u201cprogram\u201d provider.  She\nprovided proof of her efforts to resolve the two largest debts according to the lessons in this\n\u201cprogram.\u201d\nTherefore, Mitigating Conditions (MC) \u00b620.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), \u00b620.b (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and \u00b620.e (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue) apply.  \nGuideline E:  Applicant did not list the two debts set forth in Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b of\nthe SOR on her PTA form in 2006.  She denied the allegations in Paragraph 2 of the SOR in her\nAnswer.  She effectively admitted at the hearing she did not list them, but explained her\nunderstanding that having followed the \u201cprogram\u201d she bought, the debts were no longer owed.\nTherefore, in her mind, they were not 180 days or more past due, so they did not exist, and she did\nnot have to list them.  Wrong though she was, she made an honest mistake.  Her testimony and\ndemeanor at the hearing convince me she truly believed what the \u201cprogram\u201d told her to do about the\ndebts.  With no further contact from the creditors, she thought they had accepted her explanations,\nand the debts were no longer collectible.  Therefore, she did not deliberately falsify her answers to\nQuestion 22.b on the PTA form.  None of the Disqualifying Conditions under Guideline E apply.\nGuideline J:  This guideline is applicable if Applicant willfully and knowingly made a false\nstatement or representation to the U.S. Government.  It works in tandem with the allegation of\ndeliberate falsification under Guideline E.  For the same reasons stated under that Guideline E, I\nconclude Applicant did not make a willful and knowing false statement on her PTA form in\nQuestion 22.b.  No DC apply, and no MC need apply.\n\n8\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case,\nI have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nIn evaluating these factors, in addition to the DC and MC of the specific guidelines, I\nconsidered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I considered\nApplicant\u2019s age and length of marriage when her marriage dissolved.  I looked at her past and\npresent record of debt payments contained on the credit reports, noting that the period of her divorce\nand unemployment caused her financial problems and debt repayment problems out of the usual and\ncustomary pattern in her life.  I considered that only two debts were at issue, and that Applicant\nhonestly thought she was resolving them by using valid procedures under Federal law, which was\nher motivation for that conduct.  Her lack of legal sophistication and the language of the \u201cprogram\u201d\nletters contributed to her belief that she was taking a legitimate avenue to dispute these two debts.\nThe debt in SOR Subparagraph 1.a was cancelled by the creditor during the 2006 tax year, and\nApplicant paid income tax on the amount cancelled.  The use of this \u201cprogram\u201d was a one-time\noccurrence by Applicant on only two debts.  She has not repeated the use of that \u201cprogram.\u201d  It is\nnot likely she will use it again, based on her testimony.  I do not believe she poses a trustworthiness\nconcern or that similar conduct will recur in the future.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern for Applicant.\nLikewise, I conclude the personal conduct and criminal conduct trustworthiness concerns for\nApplicant.  Finally, I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n9\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for a public trust position is granted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old project manager, who has worked for a defense contractor since October 2005. He successfully held an interim secret clearance from December 2005 to April 2007, when it was revoked as a result of these proceedings. During that time-frame, Applicant was never involved in a security violation. He seeks reinstatement of his clearance, which is required to successfully perform his duties required by his employer. Apart from his wife, Applicant\u2019s immediate family members include his father, mother, two sisters and one brother. Applicant and his immediate family were all born in South Korea. Applicant\u2019s parents are retired university professors, and both parents hold Ph.D.s in chemical engineering. In 1982, Applicant\u2019s father came to the U.S. after being invited to conduct research in chemical engineering at a major U.S. university. In 1983, Applicant, his mother, two sisters and brother joined Applicant\u2019s father in the U.S. At the time Applicant joined his father, he was 16 years old.

Zaid, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Foreign Preference and \nForeign Influence.  Clearance is granted. \n \n History of Case \n \n \nOn March 21, 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF \n86).1 On April 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n \n1GE 1 (Security Clearance Application is dated March 21, 2006 on p.1; however, the signature \npage is dated February 27, 2006.) For convenience, the security clearance application in this decision will \nbe called an SF 86.    \n \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \n \n                                                          \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, \nmodified and revised.2 \n \n The SOR alleges security concerns under AGs C (Foreign Preference) and B \n(Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on April 17, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. The case was originally \nassigned to another administrative judge on June 6, 2007, and due to caseload \nconsiderations was reassigned to me on August 22, 2007. On September 6, 2007, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on October 16, 2007.  \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered three documents, which were admitted without \nobjections as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. The Applicant offered seven \nexhibits, which were admitted without objections as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nG. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 29, 2007. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibits \n(Exs.) I through XI. Applicant objected to Exs. I, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI. After \nargument by counsel, I overruled Applicant\u2019s objections to these documents and took \nadministrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which pertain to \nSouth Korea. (Tr. 18-27).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative AG to all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative AGs are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \n \nSouth Korea were derived from Exs. I through XI as indicated under subheading \u201cSouth \nKorea\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR \nwith explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old project manager, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since October 2005. He successfully held an interim secret clearance from \nDecember 2005 to April 2007, when it was revoked as a result of these proceedings. \nDuring that time-frame, Applicant was never involved in a security violation. He seeks \nreinstatement of his clearance, which is required to successfully perform his duties \nrequired by his employer.  \n \nApart from his wife, Applicant\u2019s immediate family members include his father, \nmother, two sisters and one brother. Applicant and his immediate family were all born in \nSouth Korea. Applicant\u2019s parents are retired university professors, and both parents \nhold Ph.D.s in chemical engineering. In 1982, Applicant\u2019s father came to the U.S. after \nbeing invited to conduct research in chemical engineering at a major U.S. university. In \n1983, Applicant, his mother, two sisters and brother joined Applicant\u2019s father in the U.S. \nAt the time Applicant joined his father, he was 16 years old. \n \nAfter arriving in the U.S., Applicant, his siblings and mother remained in the U.S. \nfor varying lengths of time, primarily for educational purposes. Throughout the years, \nApplicant\u2019s parents went back and forth between the U.S. and South Korea as visiting \nprofessors. Applicant\u2019s parents currently are resident citizens of South Korea. SOR \u00b6 \n2.b. Applicant\u2019s parents lived in the U.S. for a cumulative total of 23 years before \nreturning to South Korea. Tr. 77.  Applicant communicates with his parents \u201ca couple of \ntime a year on the phone.\u201d Tr. 82. Applicant has three aunts, who along with their \nrespective families live in the U.S. Tr. 89-90.  \n \nAfter Applicant graduated from high school, he enrolled in the university where \nhis father was conducting research, and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in \nmechanical engineering in December 1989. He went on to attend graduate school at the \nsame university, and in May 1993 was awarded a master\u2019s degree in mechanical \nengineering, and in July 1998 was awarded a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering.  All of \nApplicant\u2019s post-education employment has been in the U.S. except for three years he \nworked in South Korea as a technical consultant and senior consultant from July 2002 \nto July 2005. Tr. 81-82, GE 1.  After working in South Korea for this brief time, Applicant \nreturned to the U.S. with his wife in September 2005 to begin his new position \ndiscussed supra and infra. Applicant has lived approximately 20 of his 40 years in the \nU.S. Tr. 82. It is his intent to permanently reside in the U.S. Tr. 82.   \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \n \nLike the Applicant, all of his siblings graduated from high school in the U.S. and \nspent a significant portion of their formative years in the U.S. All of Applicant\u2019s three \nsiblings went on to receive their higher education, which included graduate work in the \nU.S. Tr. 77-78. \n \nApplicant\u2019s three siblings are currently resident citizens of South Korea. SOR \u00b6 \n2.c. Like his parents, Applicant communicates with his three siblings by telephone \u201c[a] \ncouple of times a year.\u201d Tr. 83-84. Applicant\u2019s brother is a civil engineer employed by a \nprivate firm, one his sisters works as an engineer at a private electronics company, and \nhis other sister works at a private bank. Tr. 88.  \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are associated with or connected \nwith the South Korean government. During the time Applicant\u2019s parents were employed \nas university professors working in South Korea, they were \u201ctechnically\u201d working for the \nSouth Korean government given they were employed at a public university. Applicant \ndescribed his parent\u2019s employment as university professors in South Korea similar to \nemployment as a professor at a state university in the U.S. Tr. 84-85.  \n \nApplicant has no reason to believe any of his family members would be \nsusceptible to coercion, pressure or blackmail from the South Korean government as a \nmeans of extracting classified information from him. Applicant believes this to be the \ncase because his family members are well traveled, savvy and not the type of people \nwho would easily be intimidated. Tr. 86-87. Applicant stated if he were approached by \nanyone seeking classified information, he would report such contact to his supervisor \nand facility security officer. Tr. 87.    \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2001, and has held a U.S. \npassport since September 2001. He is not a citizen or passport holder of any other \ncountry other than the U.S. He emphatically stated he owes his loyalties to the U.S. Tr. \n92. \n \nApplicant was previously married from January 1992 to February 1997, and that \nmarriage ended by divorce. His current wife, like him, was born in South Korea, but was \nresiding in the U.S. with her entire family at the time they met in July 2002. They \nmarried in South Korea in January 2003, and at present do not have any children. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a South Korean citizen holding permanent resident alien status and \nlives with Applicant in the U.S. SOR \u00b6 2.a. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship, but \nmust first comply with the five-year waiting period to become a citizen. She will be \neligible to apply in two years. Applicant\u2019s wife was a musician by profession in South \nKorea before emigrating to the U.S. At present, she attends school and is studying \nEnglish as a second language. \n \nGiven the amount of time Applicant has lived in the U.S., he and his wife live as \n\u201cvery much American.\u201d He described his home as an \u201cAmerican environment\u201d as \nopposed to a \u201cKorean environment.\u201d Apart from work, Applicant plays golf and is a \nmember of a city league soccer team. Tr. 89. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \n \n \n \nHis wife\u2019s immediate family consists of her mother, two older sisters, and one \nyounger brother, and they all live in the U.S. Her father passed away in 2002. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law has lived in the U.S. since 1996. She is a citizen of South \nKorea residing in the U.S. as a permanent resident alien. SOR \u00b6 2.d. His mother-in-law \nis a permanent resident and plans to apply for U.S. citizenship when eligible. Neither \nApplicant\u2019s wife nor her immediate family have ever had any connections with or are \nassociated with the South Korean government. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is retired and \nhis two sisters-in-law own bakery shops in the U.S. Tr. 73-74. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law \nis a student. \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s supervisors testified on his behalf. Both supervisors hold top \nsecret clearances. They interact daily with the Applicant and they along with their \nspouses socialize with Applicant and his wife. Both supervisors have a very high opinion \nof Applicant and consider him to be a very trusted and valuable employee.  During the \nlast performance cycle, Applicant was performing at such a superior level that he was \nthe only employee selected from his team to receive additional stock options.  Both \nsupervisors enthusiastically and without reservation recommended Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. Tr. 35-52. \n \nThe supervisory computer engineer at the government entity where Applicant is \nemployed submitted a reference letter. He stated in part, \u201cmy organization would be \ndrastically hurt if [Applicant] was not granted the necessary security clearance to \nsupport [mission].\u201d  He also stated that if Applicant is not granted a security clearance \nand allowed to continue working at his government entity, not only would his \norganization suffer by losing Applicant, but also \u201cthe US Army and its warfighters would \nsuffer the ramifications of his loss of knowledge as well.\u201d  He strongly recommended \nApplicant for a security clearance. AE G.   \n \nLastly, the wife of one of Applicant\u2019s supervisors who testified submitted a \nreference letter. She extolled on the many fine virtues Applicant and his wife have to \ninclude their values, integrity, and honesty. She stated, \u201cI deal with many \u2018Americans\u2019 \nwho have no respect for their fellow man or for our Country. In my opinion, [Applicant \nand his wife] truly appreciate the values and principles upon which our Country was \nfounded and do not take these gifts for granted. . . .

All of his financial interests \nare in the U.S., which includes a home, mutual funds, a 401(k), a certificate of deposit, \nand checking and savings accounts. Tr. 91-92. \n \nSouth Korea3 \n \nIn the decades following the Korean War, South Korea experienced political \nturmoil that included autocratic leadership, restrictions to political freedoms, military \ncoups, declarations of martial law, and violent confrontations. \n \nCurrently, South Korea is a stable, democratic republic.2 The South Korean \ngovernment has generally respected the human rights of its citizens, however, reported \nhuman rights problems include: societal discrimination against women, persons with \ndisabilities and minorities; domestic violence and rape, child abuse, and trafficking in \npersons.  The South Korean National Security Law: (a) has vague rules regarding arrest \nand detention; and (b) permits imprisonment for up to seven years for conduct that falls \nunder a vague legal standard of \u201cendangering the security of the State. The State \nDepartment has indicated it is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners in \nSouth Korea. \n \nAlthough the 1950 invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces ended in \n1953 with the establishment of a Demilitarized Zone, a peace treaty never has been \nsigned.  Noting that South Korea and North Korea legally remain in a state of war, the \nU.S. Department of State warns \u201cthe possibility of military hostilities that could \nnecessitate the evacuation of U.S. citizens from the Republic of Korea cannot be \nexcluded.\u201d \n \nFor almost 20 years after the Korean War, relations between South Korea and \nNorth Korea were minimal and very strained.  In 1991, relations between South Korea \nand North Korea improved with the South-North Basic Agreement, which acknowledged \nthat reunification was the goal of both governments. But, divergent positions on the \nprocess of reunification, the North Korean weapons programs, and South Korea\u2019s \ntumultuous domestic politics have contributed to a cycle of warming and cooling of \nrelations between South Korea and North Korea. South Korea\u2019s \u201cSunshine Policy,\u201d a \npolicy of engagement with North Korea, has been cited by the U.S. Ambassador to \nSouth Korea as one of the present challenges to U.S.-South Korean relations. \n \n \n3 The contents of the South Korea section are taken from Exs. I through XI. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n \nUnder the 1953 U.S.-Republic of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty, the United \nStates maintains a substantial military presence in South Korea.  After 1998, South \nKorean public opinion became critical of the U.S. military presence in South Korea, and \npolls since January 2004 have found that more South Koreans view the United States \nas a bigger threat to South Korea than North Korea. There has been increasing anti-\nAmerican sentiment in South Korea, including anti-American demonstrations in 2002 \nand 2006. \n \nIndustrial espionage is intelligence-gathering \u201cconducted by a foreign \ngovernment or by a foreign company with direct assistance of a foreign government \nagainst a private U.S. company for the purpose of obtaining commercial secrets. This \ndefinition does not extend to activity of private entities conducted without foreign \ngovernment involvement . . . .\u201d Industrial espionage is not limited to targeting \ncommercial secrets of a merely civilian nature, but rather can include the targeting of \ncritical technologies and classified U.S. information. Foreign government entities, \nincluding intelligence organizations and security services, have capitalized on private-\nsector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive U.S. technology by \nforeign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments or its use in military \napplications. \n \nSouth Korea has a history of collecting protected U.S. information. The 1996 \nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook notes that South \nKorea has targeted the United States with intelligence gathering programs, and has \ncentered its collection efforts on computer systems, aerospace technologies and \nnuclear technologies, and its activities have included stealing information from \ncomputerized databases maintained by U.S. government agencies. \n \nThe 2000 Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and \nIndustrial Espionage, issued by the National Counterintelligence Center, ranks Korea as \none of the seven countries most actively engaging in foreign economic collection and \nindustrial espionage against the United States. The most recent Annual Report, \nreleased in 2006, states that the major collectors remain active. \n \nSouth Korean collection activities also are evidenced by a criminal prosecution \nlinking espionage as directly involving the South Korean government. In May 1997, \nRobert Chaegon Kim, a civilian employee for the U.S. Department of Navy, Office of \nNaval Intelligence, pled guilty to \u201cconspiracy to obtain national defense information.\u201d  \nMr. Kim had passed classified documents to an officer in the South Korean navy, \nserving as the South Korean naval attach\u00e9 to the U.S. \n \nThe United States restricts the export of sensitive, dual-use technologies that can \nhave civilian uses, but also can be used for military purposes or to build weapons of \nmass destruction. South Korea has been the unauthorized recipient of technology \ncontrolled under U.S. export control laws, including: material that could be used in \nmissile delivery/reentry systems, encryption software, military truck parts, and night \nvision cameras. \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative AGs for Determining Eligibility For \nAccess to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief introductory \nexplanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions. \n \nThese AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these AGs in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \n \n4 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n \n                                                          \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n  \nAnalysis \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nAG C (Foreign Preference) \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern  \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a \nway as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d \n \n AG \u00b6 10(a) indicates one condition that raises a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case stating, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.\u201d And AG \u00b6 10(a) includes two pertinent examples, \u201c(3) Accepting educational, \nmedical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country . . . \n \n \n5\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \n \n[and] (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another \ncountry,\u201d which apply in this case.   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged Applicant maintains a bank account in South Korea with an \napproximate balance of $13,000.00, which raised a concern under this AG.  AGs \u00b6 \n11(c), \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred \nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor\u201d is the \nclosest relevant mitigating circumstance, and it does not apply in this case.  \n \n \nApplicant took the affirmative step of closing this account and transferring the \nremaining balance in the amount of $15,834.17 to his U.S. bank account on June 7, \n2007. This action substantially negates the underlying basis for this concern. As noted, \nall of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the U.S. The foreign preference concern will \nbe further addressed in the whole person concept section of this decision. \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this AG can and should consider \nthe identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is \nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country \nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and, \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under AG B. However, if only one relative lives in a \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontacts with his immediate family members, who are resident citizens of South Korea.  \nHis wife, who is a South Korean citizen, lives with him. He has contact to a lesser extent \nwith his in-laws, who are citizens of South Korea and permanent residents of the U.S. \nThese close relationships with his family members create a heightened risk of foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation because South Korea has an active collection \nprogram.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions primarily as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and travel to South \nKorea, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never \nshifts to the Government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) partially applies to Applicant\u2019s wife and 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply to \nhis relationships his in-laws. They all live in and are completely vested in the U.S. His \ncontact with his in-laws is maintained vicariously through his wife and is infrequent, and \nnot of great substance. AG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Considering how vested Applicant, his \nwife, and in-laws are in the U.S. and the nature of their business, it is unlikely Applicant \nwill be placed in a compromising position.  Also, his limited and infrequent contacts with \nhis in-laws are not a security concern because it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between his-in laws and the interests of the United States.  \n  \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n \n                                                          \nAppellant, however, did not establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) or 8(c) in regard to his parents \nand siblings. He did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of [his parents and siblings] and the interests of the \nU.S.\u201d His frequent contacts with his family members in South Korea could potentially \nforce him to choose between the United States and South Korea. He did not meet his \nburden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his parents and \nsiblings] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Appellant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the U.S., as he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States 20 of his 40 years and has lived \ncontinuously in the United States since 2005. He became a U.S. citizen in 2001. His \nwife plans to apply for U.S., but must meet the mandatory waiting period. Applicant \nspent his formative years in the U.S. to include high school, college, and went on to \nearn two graduate degrees. His parents and siblings spent a substantial number of \nyears in the U.S. and are familiar with the U.S. and the American way of life. Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts and linkage to the United States are substantial and based on his decision to \nlive in the U.S. versus South Korea and divest himself from South Korea, he has \nestablished his linkage to the U.S. is greater than his linkage to South Korea. He is \nheavily vested in the U.S., financially and emotionally. \n   \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative AGs related to the \nwhole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the \nAdministrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n   \nI carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal connections to \nSouth Korea.  He lived in South Korea half of his life.  His wife is a citizen of South \nKorea. She has frequent, non-casual conversations with her family members living in \nSouth Korea. Applicant\u2019s parents are citizen-residents of Korea.  Applicant traveled to \nSouth Korea six times since 1996. Essentially all SOR allegations are established. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 20 of his 40 years, and he has \nbeen a naturalized citizen for six years. He has long ties to the U.S., his wife and all of \nher immediate family members reside in the U.S. After working briefly in South Korea, \nhe chose to live and work in the U.S. with his wife versus South Korea. When he \nbecame a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His wife is a \npermanent resident alien and plans to apply for U.S. citizenship when eligible. All of her \nimmediate family member live in the U.S. His ties to the United States are stronger than \nhis ties to South Korea. He has no financial ties to South Korea in contrast to his U.S. \nsignificant financial ties. In fact, he took the affirmative step of divesting himself of all \nfinancial ties to South Korea by closing his bank account in South Korea and \ntransferring the funds to his U.S. bank account. There is no evidence he has ever taken \nany action which could cause potential harm to the United States. In fact, and most \nnotably, he has successfully held a security clearance for 16 months.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer confidence and trust in him is so high as to warrant \nrecommending him for a clearance. This was clearly demonstrated by two of his \nsupervisors testifying on his behalf. Both those supervisors hold top secret clearances. \nApplicant takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has worked \ndiligently for a defense contractor for 27 months. His supervisors, family, and friends \nassess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, responsible, mature, and of high \nintegrity. He has an excellent reputation as a friend, family member, employee and U.S. \ncitizen. His witnesses and documentary evidence recommend him for a security \nclearance. No witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance or produced any \nderogatory information about him.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members are not, and never have been, South Korean agents. \nSouth Korea is a highly developed, stable, democratic republic with a modern economy \nthat has dispatched troops to support the war against terrorism being led by the U.S. in \nIraq. South Korea is a country that has been and continues to be friendly with the U.S. \nfor more than 50 years. Further, there is no record evidence that South Korea has ever \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \n \n                                                          \nattempted to exploit any resident of South Korea for the purpose of compromising a \nsecurity clearance holder in the U.S.8 \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. Those considerations must answer the question whether there is a legitimate \nconcern under the facts presented that the South Korean government or its agents \nmight exploit or attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way \nthat this U.S. citizen would have to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and \nthose family members. Or, to put it another way, is it reasonable to assume that this \nloyal ally of the U.S. might do in the future what there is no evidence to suggest it has \never done in the past. Applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis, \nthe possibility is so remote as to be speculative.    \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the AGs. Applicant has \nmitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is \neligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 e.: For Applicant \n         \n \n \n \n \n8 Noting the lack of record evidence that the South Korean government has ever engaged in such \nconduct is not to imply that the Government had any burden to present such evidence.

Therefore, they are not at issue in this\nappeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(b).  \u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n2\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances . . .\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(d).  \u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n3\nresolve debts . . .\u201d  The Judge\u2019s identification of this as subparagraph (e) is error. \nDecision at 6.   \n4\n3\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn this case the Judge properly found that Applicant\u2019s financial situation raised security\nconcerns under Guideline F.  As a consequence, he went on to examine possible mitigating\nconditions.  He stated, \u201cI find that MC 20. (b)  applies because the conditions that resulted in the\n2\nfinancial problem of Applicant were largely beyond his control . . . and Applicant has acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.  MC 20. (e)  could be argued to also apply, as Applicant has\n3\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay the creditors.\u201d   The Judge went on to conclude, however, that\n4\nApplicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation, in view of the amount of\noverdue debt he still carries and the length of time it will take to pay it off.\n\n4\n Applicant\u2019s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s decision is persuasive.  The\nJudge found that Applicant\u2019s case satisfied the criteria of MC 20(b), in that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were due to causes largely beyond his control and that his response to those problems had\nbeen reasonable.  That finding is sustainable.  Having so found, it is inconsistent for the Judge then\nto conclude that Applicant had nevertheless failed in meeting his burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation.  The decision does not explain why, under the facts of this case, if Applicant had been\nreasonable in addressing problems rooted in causes beyond his control, the mere fact that it might\ntake him a long time to complete the process was a reason to deny him a clearance.  Applicant\nreasonably argues that the Judge\u2019s decision does not take into account substantial contrary record\nevidence.  For example, Applicant had paid down his wife\u2019s $250,000.00 in medical debts.\nApplicant\u2019s discharge of that enormous debt underscores the reasonableness of his actions with\nregard to the debt and undermines  the Judge\u2019s rationale for denying him a clearance under Guideline\nF by demonstrating that Applicant is not lacking in self-control or good judgment.  Under the facts\nof this case, the Judge\u2019s decision fails to draw a rational connection between his finding that MC\n20(b) has been established and his conclusion that Applicant has failed to demonstrate that his\nsecurity concerns have been  mitigated.  The Judge\u2019s decision runs contrary to the record evidence.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s decision is\nnot sustainable.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael D. Hipple             \nMichael D.

She took no action to\nresolve her debts until action on her application for a security clearance was imminent.  She falsely\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to two questions on her security clearance application about delinquent debts.\nSecurity concerns based on financial considerations and personal conduct are not mitigated.\nClearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 17, 2007, denied the allegations, and\nrequested a hearing.  The case was assigned to an administrative judge on June 12, 2007, and\nreassigned to me on July 25, 2007, based on workload.  The case was heard as scheduled on August\n23, 2007.  I kept the record open until September 4, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit additional\nevidence.  I received her evidence on September 4, 2007, and it was admitted without objection from\nDepartment Counsel.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the\nfollowing findings:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old technical services specialist for a defense contractor.  She\ngraduated from college in December 1998, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology.  She worked full-\ntime for most of her college days, but there is no evidence in the record about her income during that\nperiod.  After college, she worked for ten different employers in three states before she was hired for\nher current job.  Several were entry-level temporary jobs.  She was unemployed for a about three\nmonths in 2001 and about three months in 2004. She has worked for her current employer since\nNovember 2005 (Tr. 25-31; Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 14-27).  She has never held a security\nclearance.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors describe her as intelligent, honest, hard-working, trustworthy, and\nfinancially responsible in her personal life.  She is responsible for handling materials worth between\n$2 million and $3 million.  Her supervisors are aware of her past financial problems but believe she\nnow manages her money very carefully (AX J, M).  She was rated as \u201cexceeding expectations\u201d on\nher last performance appraisal, and she received a 4 percent pay raise.  She has received recognition\nfor her performance on three recent projects (Tr. 33).\nOne of her earlier supervisors described her as energetic, ambitious, and hard-working.  He\ncommented that she, like many recent college graduates, \u201cmade money and she spent it.\u201d  He stated\nthat she has since matured.  He stated he has no reason to question her honesty or integrity (AX L).\nBefore working for her current employer, Applicant incurred seven the delinquent debts\nalleged in the SOR, totaling  about $17,786.  Two debts were charged off or placed for collection\nin July 2000, two in September 2000, one in August 2001, one in June 2002, and one in May 2003.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s current employer has actively supported her efforts to resolve her debts and\nobtain a clearance.  Her employer referred her to a credit counseling agency (Tr. 36) and paid all her\nexpenses to attend the hearing (Tr. 52).  Her husband attended the hearing at his own expense (Tr.\n52-53).\nApplicant enrolled in a debt management plan in June 2007.  She pays $290 per month for\ndistribution to the four creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f (AX H).  She makes\npayments directly to the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b and 1.g (AX E, G, N).  Her consolidated\npayment plan is designed to pay off all delinquent debts within about 24 months (Tr. 36).  Her\nseparate payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is designed to run for about 30 months (Tr. 75).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nLibrary fines\n$238\nPlaced for collection 6-02;\npaid 8-07\nGX 3 at 1; AX I; \nTr. 34\n1.b\nCredit card\n$2,428\nCharged off 7-00; payment\nplan started 8-07\nGX 3 at 1; AX G; \nTr. 35\n1.c\nCredit card\n$468\nCharged off 9-00; payment\nplan started 8-07\nGX 2 at 2; AX H; \nAX N; Tr. 35-36\n1.d\nCredit card\n$504\nCharged off 9-00; payment\nplan started 8-07\nGX 2 at 2; AX H; \nAX N; Tr. 35-36\n1.e\nTelephone\ncredit card\n$2,917\nPlaced for collection 7-00;\npayment plan started 8-07\nGX 2 at 2; AX H; \nAX N; Tr. 37\n1.f\nCredit card\n$6,527\nPlaced for collection 8-01;\npayment plan started 8-07\nGX 2 at 2; AX D; \nTr. 39\n1.g\nCar payments\n$4,704\nPlaced for collection 5-03;\npayment plan started 7-07\nGX 2 at 3; AX E; \nAX N; Tr. 40\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect several delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR.  A\ndelinquent medical collection account for $1,628 is being paid through her debt management plan\n(GX 2 at 1; AX H; Tr. 40).  Her most recent credit report reflects several collection accounts for\nunpaid parking tickets issued in 2003 and 2004 (AX A at 4-11; Tr. 44-45).  She testified she is\nmaking monthly payments on the parking tickets, but she submitted no substantiating documentation\n(Tr. 45).\nApplicant testified that her debts became delinquent because she was dealing with personal\nissues that superseded her concern for her financial obligations.  Her Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) discloses that, from August 1999 to the date of her e-QIP, she\nreceived therapy and counseling for child sexual abuse at the hands of her biological father ( GX 1\nat 34-35).  She testified she spent much of her money for counseling and medication (Tr. 71).  Her\n\n5\ncounseling is now partially covered by her medical insurance.  She now spends about $100 per\nmonth for medications, about $40 per month for individual counseling, and $45 weekly for group\ncounseling (Tr. 87).\nApplicant was married in March 2007.  Her net monthly income is about $2,200, and her\nhusband\u2019s net monthly income is about $2,400.  After they pay their rent, car payment, car insurance,\nstudent loans, utility and phone bills, they have a net monthly remainder of about $2,800 for living\nexpenses, debt payments, and savings (AX K).  They spend $200-$400 per month for groceries,\ntoiletries, and miscellaneous expenses (Tr. 85).  Applicant\u2019s husband handles most of the family\nfinances (Tr. 53).  \nApplicant has about $12,500 in her 401(k) retirement account (AX F; Tr. 50).  She and her\nhusband live frugally and rarely spend money on entertainment (Tr. 50-52).  She has not used credit\ncards since 2000 (Tr. 81).\nApplicant executed her e-QIP on January 20, 2006.  She answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28(a)\nand (b), asking if she had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years\nand if she was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debt.  She did not disclose any of the\ndebts listed above.\nIn mid-2006, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator and questioned about her\ndelinquent debts.  She readily admitted the debts to the investigator, and she disclosed her financial\nsituation to her supervisor after her interview with the investigator (Tr. 58).  She was aware her debts\nraised security concerns, but she did nothing to address the debts until she received the SOR in\nMarch 2007.  She testified she was \u201cin denial\u201d and not focused on her past debts (Tr. 65-66).  \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying her e-QIP. She testified she misunderstood questions\n28(a) and (b) and thought they applied only to the original lenders and did not apply to debts that\nwere charged off or referred to collection agencies (Tr. 54-55).  She was aware of the delinquent\ndebts but adamantly insisted at the hearing that she did not believe they were encompassed by the\nquestions (Tr. 79-81).  She had examined her credit report in 2005, in contemplation of purchasing\na house,  and she was aware of her old delinquent debts (Tr. 96).  At the time she executed the e-QIP,\nshe had no recent debts to original creditors more than 90 days past due (Tr. 55).  She knew her\ncredit reports would be included in her background investigation (Tr. 56).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\n\n6\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling about $17,786, charged off or referred for\ncollection between June 2000 and May 2003.  The concern under this guideline is as follows:\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all\nof which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or\nintent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there\nis \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c)\n\n7\nare raised by Applicant\u2019s financial history.  AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised, because she recently established\na realistic plan to pay her debts.  AG \u00b6 19(e) is not raised, because there is no evidence in the record\nabout her income during the period the debts were incurred.\nApplicant introduced evidence of several delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR.  Conduct\nnot alleged in the SOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether\nan applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision\nof the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis\nunder Directive Section 6.3.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations\nomitted).  I have considered this evidence for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence\nof mitigation, determining whether she has changed her financial habits, and in my whole person\nanalysis.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and(c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  Applicant\u2019s debts are multiple and still not fully resolved.  Her\nrepayment plans have not been in effect long enough to establish a track record of financial\nresponsibility, especially in light of her long record of financial neglect.  \u201cOnly with the passage of\ntime will there be a track record that shows whether a person, through actions and conduct, is willing\nand able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that the person has acted in\nthe past.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  I\nconclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nFrom her graduation in 1999 until she found her current position in November 2005, she worked at\na series of intermittent, entry-level jobs, and she experienced at least two periods of unemployment,\nthe last in late 2004.  Her underemployment and unemployment were circumstances beyond her\ncontrol.  However, she found a permanent and responsible position in November 2005, but she took\nno action to resolve her debts until June 2007.  \nSince 1999, Applicant has been undergoing counseling and receiving medication for\nunspecified problems arising from child sexual abuse.  These problems were beyond her control.\nHowever, the record does not reflect the severity of her emotional problems and does not establish\nthat she was mentally or emotionally unable to act responsibly.  To the contrary, she acted\nresponsibly and decisively starting in June 2007, even though she continues to take medication and\n\n8\nreceive counseling.  She also incurred medical expenses, in an amount not reflected in the record,\nfor medication and counseling, but her medical expenses have been partially covered by her medical\ninsurance since she began her current employment.  Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment,\nemotional distress, and medical expenses were all circumstances beyond her control.  However, I\nam not satisfied she acted responsibly.  Applicant has the burden of establishing a mitigating\ncondition.  I conclude she has not carried her burden with respect to AG \u00b6 20(b).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  This condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).  The\nconcept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness,\nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL\n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by\npayment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  Applicant took no action\nto resolve her debts until she received the SOR and finally realized she would not receive a clearance\nunless she put her financial house in order.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant intentionally falsified her security clearance application by\nanswering \u201cno\u201d to the two questions about delinquent debts.  The concern under this guideline is as\nfollows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.  \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s\nstate of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record\nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an\napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd.\nNov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant is a well-educated, mature adult.  She presented herself at the hearing as very\nintelligent and articulate.  Her supervisors commented favorably on her intelligence.  I find her\nexplanation for not disclosing her debts totally implausible.  She saw the delinquent debts on her\ncredit report in 2005.  She admits she was \u201cin denial\u201d about her debts, even after being interviewed\nby a security investigator.  Her emotional distress deserves sympathy and understanding.\nNevertheless, the evidence shows she knew she had numerous delinquent debts that had been\n\n9\ncharged off or referred to collection agencies, but she intentionally failed to disclose them on her e-\nQIP.  I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is established.\nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance application\ncan be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(a).\nApplicant executed her application in January 2006, but she did not correct the omission until she\nwas confronted with the evidence by a security investigator six months later.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a)\nis not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(c).  Applicant\u2019s offense is not minor; it is\na felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and it goes to the heart of the security clearance process.  It is\nrecent.  It is \u201cinfrequent\u201d because there is no evidence of other falsifications.  It occurred during a\nroutine security clearance application in connection with employment by a defense contract, which\nis not a unique circumstance.  The falsification casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  The absence of other incidents of falsification offers some mitigation, but the\nremaining elements of AG \u00b6 17(c) are not established.\nSecurity concerns can be mitigated by evidence that \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(d).  It is unclear to what extent, if any,\nApplicant\u2019s unfortunate childhood experiences caused her to conceal her financial problems.  For\nreasons not apparent from the record, she chose not to present more detailed medical evidence.  To\nthe extent her emotional distress affected her financial management, she has sought medication and\ncounseling to address those stressors.  Her conduct is somewhat mitigated by the emotional distress\nher life experiences have caused her and her positive steps to deal with it.\nLastly, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 17(e).  Applicant has now made full disclosure of her financial history and taken positive steps\nto right her financial ship.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(e) is established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\n\n10\nApplicant is a mature, intelligent, well-educated adult.  She has impressed her current\nsupervisors, as demonstrated by the strong support she has received before and during the hearing.\nShe has made a good start in resolving her financial problems, but not enough time has elapsed to\ndemonstrate a change in financial habits.  Her previous unwillingness to face financial reality and\nher lack of candor on her security clearance application raise serious concerns that can be overcome\nonly by a track record of financial responsibility and absolute candor.  Insufficient time has elapsed\nto demonstrate such a track record.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns based on financial considerations and personal conduct.  Accordingly, I\nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant her a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 3, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nMay 12, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on December 26, 2007, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on April 17, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 23,\n2008.\nThe record was kept open until April 25, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit a copy of his military discharge paperwork (DD Form 214). It was timely\nsubmitted and forwarded by department counsel without objections. The DD Form 214\nis admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that in December 2005 Applicant pleaded\nguilty to the federal offense of conspiracy to commit fraud relating to the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and he was\nsentenced to two years of probation and ordered to serve 100 hours of community\nservice. Applicant admits this allegation. Under Guideline F, the SOR refers to the\nconspiracy offense alleged under Guideline J and alleges that in 2005 Applicant filed a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy case, which was discharged in 2006. Applicant admits these\nallegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He works as a field\nengineer and is responsible for maintenance and repair of equipment in the field. He\nhas worked for his current employer since 2004. He worked for another federal\ncontractor from 1997 to 2004. In addition, his employment history includes more than\ntwo decades of military service in the U.S. Army (Tr. 51\u201354; Exhibit F). He retired as a\nsenior noncommissioned officer (NCO) at the pay grade of E7. His discharge paperwork\nreflects a solid and successful career as an Army NCO who specialized in the repair of\nair defense artillery equipment (Exhibit F). \nApplicant\u2019s wife is 59 years old, and they have been married since 1972. They\nhave no children. She is now a partner in a used-car business.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s federal conviction stems from a HUD housing fraud scheme.\nAccording to Applicant, in 2002 he and his wife entered into a business agreement with\na trusted friend, and they formed a corporation to buy foreclosed properties (Exhibit E).\nThe general idea was to buy houses from banks, finance companies, and the HUD, and\nthen sell the houses after making any necessary repairs. Applicant maintains that the\nbusiness partner was buying HUD homes via straw purchasers without  his knowledge. \nIn May 2005, Applicant, his wife, and three others were indicted by a federal\ngrand jury (Exhibit 5). Applicant was charged in Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment. In\nCount 1, he was charged with the conspiracy offense as well as engaging in fraud or\nmaking a false statement for a HUD transaction in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010. In\nCount 3, he was charged with a making a false statement to a federal agency in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \nOn December 1, 2005, Applicant pleaded guilty to Count 1 for conspiracy to\ncommit fraud relating to the HUD in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Exhibit 4). The court\ndismissed Count 3 based on the prosecution\u2019s motion. The court sentenced Applicant to\nserve probation for 24 months. Also, he was required to serve 100 hours of community\nservice as a condition of probation. He served the probation without incident or violation.\nIn December 2007, he was released from court-ordered supervision and all supervision\nrequirements (Exhibit A). Applicant has no other history of criminal conduct.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife pleaded guilty on the same day. She was sentenced to serve\nprobation for 4 years or 48 months. She is currently serving probation and is scheduled\nto remain on probation until about December 1, 2009. \nRecently, Applicant and his wife received notice from the HUD that they owed a\ndebt related to the sale of houses (Tr. 63\u201365). They paid $11,000 to settle the matter,\nand it is pending final resolution. Besides the HUD debt, Applicant is aware of no\ncurrent collection activity against him (Tr. 63). \nBefore pleading guilty, Applicant and his wife spent a large sum of money on\nlegal fees. Each had a defense attorney, and Applicant puts the figure at about $55,000\nfor legal fees (Tr. 38). This expense, along with his wife\u2019s job loss, resulted in Applicant\nand his wife seeking protection by pursuing the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in which\nthey listed total assets of about $261,010 and total liabilities of about $316,792. The\nbankruptcy court granted a discharge in January 2006. \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s income as a field engineer, he receives about $1,575\nper month for his military retirement pay. He has about $2,200 in a checking account\nand about $30,000 in a 401(k) account (Tr. 57). Applicant is meeting his financial\nobligations and able to save money (Tr. 57). Three credit reports were admitted into\nevidence and none reflect a past-due, collection, or charged-off account (Exhibits 2, 3,\nand D). The most recent credit report from April 2008 reports a credit score of 646,\nwhich is considered \u201cfair\u201d (Exhibit D). He has two sizeable car loans and a mortgage\npayment, which are current and in good standing.  \n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n16\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n17\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (\u201cIf two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States,\n18\nor to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of\nsuch persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\nnot more than five years, or both.\u201d).\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n14\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n15\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s 2005 federal conviction. In\nparticular, DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant based on the grand jury indictment\n16\n17\nfor multiple offenses and his subsequent guilty plea to the conspiracy offense. Although\nthe sentence was limited to probation and community service, the conspiracy offense\nwas a felony with a maximum punishment of imprisonment for five years.  He\n18\ncompleted probation a few months ago in December 2007. To sum up, the criminal\nconduct calls into question Applicant\u2019s judgment and his ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322. \n19\n See ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006) (addressing the collateral-estoppel doctrine).\n20\n6\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns.\n19\nThe four potentially applicable MCs are as follows:\nMC 1\u2013so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or\nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\nMC 2\u2013the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life;\nMC 3\u2013evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \nMC 4\u2013there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment\nrecord, or constructive community involvement. \n \nHe was indicted in 2005 for criminal conduct in about 2002, he pleaded guilty in\n2005, and he completed his sentence to probation a few months ago. Given these\ncircumstances, the criminal behavior is relatively recent. In addition, although the\ncircumstances were unusual, it continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment in light of the nature of the offense (conspiracy to commit fraud).\nAccordingly, MC 1 does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThere is no evidence suggesting Applicant was pressured or coerced.\nAccordingly, MC 2 does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant seems to suggest that he and his wife were duped by a trusted friend\n(Exhibit E). Nevertheless, Applicant, who was represented by an attorney, elected not to\ncontest the case against him when he pleaded guilty. Applicant\u2019s federal felony\nconviction precludes consideration of evidence that he did not commit the offense to\nwhich he pleaded guilty.  Accordingly, MC 3 does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n20\nMC 4 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor because there is some evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation. He served probation without incident or violation and was released from\ncourt-ordered supervision on about December 1, 2007 (Exhibit A). He remained\nemployed during the entire period, and he appears to have a good employment record\n(Exhibits B and C). He is working to recover from the financial problems resulting from\nhis criminal case and his credit history is improving (Exhibit D). Before the federal\nindictment in 2005, he had no history of criminal conduct, and he had enjoyed a\nsuccessful career in the Army (Exhibit F). \n\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n21\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n22\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n23\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n24\n DC 4 is \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income\n25\ntax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional breaches of\nfinancial trust.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n26\n7\nThe SOR also alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations,  where a security concern typically exists due to significant unpaid\n21\ndebts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual\n22\nwho is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or\ncareless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information.   \nAlthough not a typical Guideline F case, the record evidence supports a\nconclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems. First, Applicant\u2019s Chapter\n7 bankruptcy case is substantial evidence of inability to satisfy debts  and a history of\n23\nnot meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of the guideline. Second,\n24\nApplicant\u2019s federal conviction is substantial evidence of a deceptive or illegal financial\npractice within the meaning of the guideline.  Taken together, these circumstances call\n25\ninto question Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns,\n26\nand those conditions are as follows:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n8\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, MC 3 is most pertinent; the others do not\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe federal conviction, as discussed above, is  relatively recent. Likewise, the\nChapter 7 bankruptcy case is relatively recent because it was discharged about two\nyears ago in January 2006. In addition, although the circumstances were unusual, it\ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment in light of the\nnature of the offense (conspiracy to commit fraud). Accordingly, MC 1 does not apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nThere is insufficient evidence to show that the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problems were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Accordingly, MC 2 does not apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nThere are indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or\nare under control. His financial condition has improved since the bankruptcy. He has no\ncurrent past-due, collection, or charged-off accounts, and he is current with his bills. He\nhas money in the bank and in a retirement account. And he appears to be living within\nhis means. Accordingly, Applicant receives some credit under MC 3. \nFinally, MC 4, MC 5, and MC 6 are inapplicable based on the facts of this case. \nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this case presents both disqualifying\nand mitigating circumstances, which requires thoughtful balancing. First, Applicant is 60\nyears old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions. In other words, he had\nsufficient experience in the ways of the world to know what he was doing when he\nengaged in the activity that led to his federal conviction. Second, viewed individually, his\nfederal conviction and his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case each raise doubts about his\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. And viewed collectively, these circumstances\nraise serious doubts about his suitability for access to classified information. Third,\nApplicant receives credit for his lengthy record of honorable military service, the\nabsence of workplace misconduct, his good employment record, and his otherwise\n\n9\ngood record as a law-abiding citizen. But those matters are not enough to overcome or\noutweigh the security concerns raised by his federal conviction and the Chapter 7\nbankruptcy case. The nature of the criminal offense is of special concern because it\ninvolved a conspiracy to commit fraud related to a department of the federal\ngovernment. Although an unfavorable clearance decision may have an adverse effect\non Applicant, his family, or his employer, it should come as no surprise to Applicant that\nthe same federal government that prosecuted him for conspiracy to commit fraud now\nhas serious doubts about his fitness for a security clearance. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, a commonsense decision militates against Applicant and in favor\nof protecting national security.   \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Monaghan, Esq.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(d).\n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 15, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 28, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T.\nWilliams granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (ACMC) 23(d)  is arbitrary and capricious in that it\n1\nis not supported by record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant is 53 years old and has\nworked as a senior mechanical designer for a defense contractor since 1994.  He is divorced and has\ntwo adult children.\nOn several occasions between 1971 to at least July 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol, at\ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication.  He first began drinking alcohol at age 17.  At times\nhe has consumed as much as a quart of rum a day.\nOn February 16, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle\nunder the influence of liquor.  After consuming about four ounces of brandy, he was driving home\nand was stopped by the police because the car was swerving.  He pled no contest and was fined $500,\nplaced on unsupervised probation, and ordered to attend alcohol counseling.  His driver\u2019s license was\nsuspended for eight months.  His alcohol consumption increased during 1999 because of marital\ndifficulties, which included his wife suffering from a serious mental illness.  In June 2004, after\nseparating form his wife, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault on his girlfriend.  He had\nbeen drinking prior to this arrest.  This charge was dismissed.\nAfter the death of his girlfriend in 2004, for about two weeks, Applicant drank excessively,\nconsuming alcohol to numb his pain and grief.  He was treated for depression after her death.\nApplicant sought help from the Employee Assistance Office at worked and they suggested that he\nenroll in an alcohol treatment program.\n\n3\nApplicant attended alcohol treatment at an institute from December 27, 2004, until January\n24, 2005.  He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and depression.  These diagnoses were made\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.  He attended both individual and group counseling, which included education groups,\ntherapy groups, and AA/NA meetings every night.  At the time of his discharge, his prognosis was\npositive if he followed through with his discharge plans, including returning to his apartment and\nreturning to his employment, which he accomplished.  At least four weeks after rehabilitation, he\ncontinued to attend meetings to talk about his alcohol problems.\nA witness at the hearing, a retired Army chaplain and Brigadier General with a Ph.D. in\nclinical psychology, testified about post-traumatic stress syndrome as it related to the events of\nApplicant\u2019s loss of his girlfriend.  Applicant is one of his parishioners, and he has been counseling\nhim for about six months about the loss of his girlfriend, which led to his excessive consumption of\nalcohol.  The witness stated that Applicant\u2019s depression, which he had self-medicated with alcohol,\nwas consistent with post traumatic stress disorder.\n  \nDuring the six months preceding the decision, Applicant sought counseling from his pastor\nand obtained a better understanding of why he spun out of control after the death of his girlfriend.\nAlthough he did not cease drinking alcohol, he modified his behavior to a glass or two of wine a\nmonth.  He does not believe he will drink and drive again.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a character letter.  The witness indicated that once Applicant\u2019s\ndrinking got out of control, he sought help from the Employee Assistance Office and entered\nrehabilitation.  He stated that since completing the rehabilitation program Applicant\u2019s physical and\nmental health have improved, as have his attendance at work and the quality of his work\nperformance.\n \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  His argument that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by record evidence will be addressed below.  \n\n4\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge based her favorable decision, in part, upon ACMC 23(d), which mitigates alcohol-\nrelated security concerns when \u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d\nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s having completed an alcohol treatment program, the counseling he had\nreceived from his pastor, and his testimony that he had modified his drinking to a glass or two of\nwine a month.  She also noted that Applicant testified that \u201che does not believe he will drink and\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 3, Personal Subject Interview, at 3.  \u201cSubject occasionally drinks, defined as a few\n2\nbeers per week, but stays away from hard liquor.  Subject no longer gets intoxicated to the point where he did in the past,\nbut just to where he feels mellow and sleepy but not violent.  Subject stated that he no longer gets sloppy and has had\nno problems at work since.  Subject declined to answer questions about exactly how many beers and how many nights\nper week, how much it takes to become intoxicated, and how often he is intoxicated.\u201d \nTr. at 32-33.  \n3\nGE 4, Medical Records, at 19.  Applicant testified that he attended AA meetings for about four months after\n4\ncompleting his treatment and that he does not have an AA sponsor.  Tr. at 29-30.  There is no evidence in the file that\nApplicant participated in the prescribed aftercare program.  Applicant\u2019s brief does not refute these matters, but argues\nthat the recommendations are advisory rather than mandatory.  Brief at 8.\n  \nApplicant testified that he missed some work due to drinking and that upon two occasions reported to work\n5\nunder the influence of alcohol.  Tr. at 25-26.  \nSee Note 2 above.\n6\n5\ndrive again.\u201d  In light of these matters, the Judge concluded that Applicant had \u201cmitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s case.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusion did not take into account significant\ncontrary record evidence.  The Board finds this argument persuasive.  The Board notes, for example,\nthat Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation program diagnosed him as alcohol dependent and advised him to\nabstain from the consumption of alcohol.  However, as the Judge acknowledged, Applicant\ncontinued to drink.  Testifying that he drank wine a couple of times a month, he acknowledged his\nprior statement to an interviewer in 2006 that he drank beer weekly.   Additionally, he testified that,\n2\nabout six months prior to the hearing, he consumed enough alcohol to render him unfit to operate\na vehicle.   Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s discharge plan recommended that he continue to attend\n3\nAlcoholics Anonymous, obtain a sponsor, and participate in aftercare, yet he has completed none of\nthese recommendations.   When viewed in light of his extensive history of alcohol abuse, his DUI,\n4\nhis lost work time due to drinking,  and his diagnosis of alcohol dependence, Applicant\u2019s evidence\n5\nas to reduced drinking fails to establish even an appropriate pattern of modified consumption, much\nless the abstinence recommended by his alcohol treatment program.  The Judge\u2019s favorable\napplication of ACMC 23(d) is not sustainable on this record.\nFor similar reasons, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis fails to provide a reasonable basis to\ngrant Applicant a clearance.  The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s grief over the death of his girlfriend and\nhis remorse over his DUI.  However, she does not explain why these matters mitigate Applicant\u2019s\nlengthy history of security significant alcohol abuse, especially in light of his continued drinking and\nhis reluctance to describe the extent of that drinking to the official conducting his subject  interview.6\nThe record, viewed as a whole, does not sustain the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his\nburden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him\n\n6\nto have a security clearance.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528.  Accordingly, the Board holds that the\nJudge\u2019s decision is not supported by the record evidence. \n \nOrder\nThe Judge favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \n \n     \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. 18.\n3\nId.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 14, 2005, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security clearance and issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR)  on February 15, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security\n2\nconcerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR\nwas issued.\nOn March 13, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel indicated the Government was ready to proceed on July 11, 2007. The case was\nassigned to another administrative judge on July 16, 2007. The case was reassigned to me on August\n3, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 9, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 30,\n2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted exhibits\n1-4, and Applicant did not submit any exhibits. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to\nsubmit documents, and Applicant\u2019s exhibits A-E  were admitted into the record without objection.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 53 years old and works as a senior mechanical designer for a defense contractor\nsince 1994. After high school, he joined the Army and served three years in the Medical Corps. Upon\ndischarge, he served in the Army National Guard (E7) from 1972 to 1975. From 1976 to 1978, he\nserved in the Army Reserve. He retired from military service two years ago after having a heart\nattack. In 1979, he received a certificate after attending a two-year program at an institute of\nindustrial technology. He was married in October 1979 and divorced in January 2007. He has two\nadult children.\nOn several occasions between 1971 to at least July 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol, at\ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication. He first began drinking alcohol at age 17.  He\n3\nindicated that at the time \u201c[h]is [Applicant\u2019s] daily consumption was then 1quart of rum.\u201d4\n\nId. at 22.\n5\nId. at 23.\n6\nId. at 33.\n7\nId. at 42.\n8\nId. at 66.\n9\nId. at 45.\n10\n4\nOn February 16, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle\nunder the influence of liquor. After consuming about four ounces of brandy, he was driving home\nand was stopped by the police because the car was swerving.  He pled no contest. He was fined\n5\n$500, placed on unsupervised probation, ordered to attend alcohol counseling, and his driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended for eight months. His alcohol consumption increased during 1999 because\nof marital difficulties, which included his wife suffering from a serious mental illness \u201cwhich\nlingered for years.\u201d6\nIn June 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault of his girlfriend. He had been\ndrinking prior to this arrest. This charge was dismissed.\nAfter the death of his girlfriend in 2004, for about two weeks Applicant drank excessively\nconsuming alcohol to numb his pain and grief. He was treated for depression after her death. He\nsought help from the Employee Assistance Office at worked and they suggested that he enroll in an\nalcohol treatment program.\nApplicant attended alcohol treatment at an institute from December 27, 2004, until January\n24, 2005. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and depression. These diagnoses were made\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram. He attended both individual and group counseling, which included education groups,\ntherapy groups, and AA/NA meetings every night. At the time of his discharge, his prognosis was\npositive if he followed through with his discharge plans, including returning to his apartment and\nreturning to his employment, which he accomplished. At least four weeks after rehabilitation, he\ncontinued to attend meetings to talk about his alcohol problems.7\nA witness who is a retired Army chaplain and Brigadier General, with a Ph.D. in clinical\npsychology, testified about posttraumatic stress syndrome as it related to the events of Applicant\u2019s\nloss of his girlfriend.  Applicant is one of his parishioners and he has been counseling him for about\n8\nsix months about the loss of his girlfriend, which led to his excessive consumption of alcohol.  The\n9\nwitness stated:\nSo knowing [Applicant\u2019s] history, the loss, the depression that he went through, some\nof the counseling he went through, the counseling that I\u2019ve done with him, I would\nsay that this was a typical outcome [posttraumatic stress syndrome] for someone who\nhad had that kind of loss.10\n\nEx.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n5\nDuring the last six months, Applicant has sought counseling from his pastor and he has a\nbetter understanding of why he spun out of control after the death of his girlfriend. Although he has\nnot ceased drinking alcohol, he has modified his behavior to a glass or two of wine a month. He does\nnot believe he will drink and drive again.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a character letter.  The witness indicated that once Applicant\u2019s\n11\ndrinking got out of control, he sought help from the Employee Assistance Office and entered\nrehabilitation. He stated that:\nSince completing the program, [Applicant] has seemed to turn himself around, his\nattendance has improved, he is on time he is routinely at his desk working, and the\nquality and quantity of his work has improved. His physical and mental health has\nimproved and he seems to be happier with who he is and what he is doing.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n12\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n13\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n14\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n15\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n16\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n17\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\n\n6\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol consumption is a security concern because \u201cexcessive consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21.)\nApplicant has a long history of drinking alcohol that spans more than 30 years. Applicant\nwas arrested in 1999 and charged with operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor. He was\nfined $500, placed on unsupervised probation, ordered to attend alcohol counseling, and his driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended for eight months. Moreover, in June 2004, Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with assault of his girlfriend and had been drinking prior to this arrest. In 2004, after the\ndeath of his girlfriend, he excessively consumed alcohol as a way of dealing with his grief. Realizing\nthat his drinking was out of control, he talked to the Employee Assistance Office at work and was\nadvised to enroll in an alcohol treatment program. Applicant enrolled in and completed a six-week\ninpatient alcohol treatment program. He was diagnosed as being alcohol dependent and depressed.\nThus, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from\nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent) and \u00b6 22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a member of a recognized alcohol treatment program ) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. After consuming\nalcohol, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault of his girlfriend. His girlfriend died in\n2004, and his drinking increased. In that same year, he completed treatment at an inpatient alcohol\ntreatment program and was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and depressed. During the last six\nmonths, he has sought counseling from his pastor. Applicant has a better understanding of why he\nspun out of control after the death of his girlfriend. Although he has not ceased drinking alcohol, he\nhas modified his behavior to a glass or two of wine a month. Moreover, he does not believe he will\ndrink and drive again. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition \u00b6 23(d) (the\nindividual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with\nany required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordant with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly\nqualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized alcohol treatment program) apply. Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s case.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas had a drinking history from 1971 to 2006. Applicant testified credibly about his remorse for his\n1999 charge of operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor. In 2004, after his girlfriend\u2019s death,\nhe enrolled and completed a six-week inpatient alcohol treatment program. Based on the evidence\n\n7\nof record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. For\nthe reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

On January 25, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on February 13, 2007, and elected to have the case decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case\non May 2, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on May 8, 2007.\nHis response was due June 7, 2007. As of July 17, 2007, he had not responded. The case was\nassigned to me on July 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n13\n4\nWhile pending his court date on the above charge, Applicant was arrested again on April 21,\n2005, for DUI, reckless driving, failure to maintain lane, and following too closely. Through a\nnegotiated plea, Applicant pled guilty on July 5, 2006, to DUI, and the other offenses were merged\ninto that charge. Applicant was sentenced to a $300 fine and 12 months in the county jail. He was\ncredited with one day for time served, and the remainder of 11 months and 29 days was served on\nprobation. Terms of his probation included that Applicant attend a risk reduction program and at\nleast three Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per week for six months, provide 40 hours of\ncommunity service within six months, pay a probation fee of $32 per month, not drink any alcohol\nor take any drugs without a prescription, and submit to random alcohol and drug testing at\nApplicant\u2019s expense. Applicant\u2019s probation was scheduled to become non-reporting without fees\nafter six months, upon completion of all special conditions, and provided Applicant had not violated\nprobation.7\nApplicant kept his employer\u2019s security personnel fully apprised of the status of his two arrests\nin 2005. Applicant started attending AA meetings in about April 2005, long before he was ordered\nby the court.  In his response to the SOR in February 2007, Applicant stated his probation officer\n8\ntold him his case was closed. He stated he had not consumed alcohol since his April 2005 arrest, was\nstill attending AA meetings, and intended to continue to do so.  Because Applicant elected to have\n9\nhis case decided on the written record and did not submit any information in response to the FORM,\nthere is no information about Applicant\u2019s status since February 2007.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n10\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n11\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n12\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n13\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\n\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n14\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n5\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n14\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n15\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nThe potential Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) in this case are AC\nDC 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC DC 22(c)\n(habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent). \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related charges in 2005 establish AC DC 22(a). Applicant admitted\nhe consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1977\nto April 2005. No further evidence was submitted as to how much and how often he drank. This\nadmission is insufficient to support a finding that Applicant\u2019s drinking was \u201chabitual,\u201d or constituted\n\u201cbinge\u201d drinking. AC DC 22(c) is not established.\nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 1978. The charge was dismissed without a guilty finding.\nApplicant stated the charge was dismissed because his BAC was below the legal limit. No other\nevidence was submitted. The arrest alone, without a guilty finding or other evidence, is insufficient\nto support a finding against Applicant. SOR \u00b6 1.b. is concluded for Applicant. \n\n6\nSOR \u00b6 1.e. alleges that Applicant \u201cattended AA meetings from about April 2005 to at least\nOctober 2006.\u201d This is true, but seeking assistance for his drinking issues through AA is a positive\ndevelopment. I do not find that attending AA meetings supports the application of any disqualifying\ncondition. SOR \u00b6 1.e. is concluded for Applicant. \nThere are three potential Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) in this case,\nAC MC 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AC MC 23(b) (the individual acknowledges\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser)), and AC MC 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear\nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program).\nApplicant\u2019s last arrest for DUI was in April 2005, while pending adjudication of a February\n2005 DUI arrest. Applicant stated in February 2007, that he had not consumed alcohol since his\nApril 2005 arrest, he was still attending AA meetings, and intended to continue to do so. Applicant\nwas on probation at that time, and continued on probation until early July 2007. He could not drink\nwhile on probation, and was required to attend AA meetings through January 2007. I have no\ninformation from Applicant since February 2007. Applicant stated his probation officer told him that\nhis case was closed. He still had to complete the non-reporting half of his probation. There is no\ninformation whether Applicant  successfully completed his probation without drinking, or that he\nhas remained abstinent since his probation ended. Because of his incidents of poor judgment, and\nlack of recent information, I am unable to make an affirmative finding that Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nincidents are unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment. AC MC 23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged his issues of alcohol abuse. He provided evidence of actions taken\nto overcome his problem, i.e., AA meetings and abstention from alcohol. Applicant did not drink\nfrom April 2005, through at least February 2007. Applicant has established a pattern of abstinence.\nI find AC MC 23(b) is applicable, but Applicant does not merit as much consideration under this\nmitigating condition because of the relatively short duration of the pattern of abstinence, the\nabstinence occurred while Applicant was pending adjudication of his charges, or on probation, and\nApplicant did not submit evidence that he has remained abstinent the last six months.\nApplicant attended a risk reduction program as part of his sentence. There was no other\nevidence submitted about what that involved in the program, so I cannot conclude that Applicant\ncompleted alcohol counseling or rehabilitation. There was no diagnosis in this case of alcohol\ndependence or alcohol abuse, nor was there a favorable prognosis. AC MC 23(d) is not applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\n\n7\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and his stable employment record. Applicant\nhad two alcohol-related arrests in 2005, and subsequent convictions. His second DUI arrest occurred\nwhile he was waiting for his other charge to go to court. To Applicant\u2019s credit, he did not attempt\nto hide his arrests, but kept his employer\u2019s security officials appraised of his circumstances.\nApplicant stated in February 2007, that he complied with his court requirements, had not consumed\nalcohol since April 2005, and continued to regularly attend AA meetings. I have no information from\nApplicant since February 2007. He remained on probation through early July 2007. Applicant\u2019s\nsecond DUI, shortly after his other DUI, reveals alcohol issues, and it also reveals questionable\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security concerns\nraised by his alcohol issues. He has done nothing to establish what he has done the last six months.\nApplicant has not been incident-free long enough to show the presence of rehabilitation. Without\nan extended pattern of incident-free conduct, during a period in which Applicant is unrestrained by\nthe conditions of probation, it is too early to conclude this pattern will not continue. The likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence of incidents of questionable judgment remains significant. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his alcohol consumption.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n\n8\nEdward W.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant\u2019s casual and infrequent foreign contacts with his two sisters in Vietnam pose\nno security risk.  Clearance is granted.  \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 19, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on\nMay 2, 2007.   A notice of hearing was issued on May 8, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 13,\n2007.  The case was transferred to this Administrative Judge on May 24, 2007.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented two exhibits.  The Applicant presented seven exhibits, called three witnesses\nand testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and\nthe testimony.  The Applicant is 54 years of age and has a Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer\nScience and Electrical Engineering.  He is employed as a Senior Software Engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Vietnam in 1953.  He grew up there, and later fled the country in\n1975, when the communist regime took control.  His cousin, who, at the time, was a high ranking\nmilitary officer for the South Vietnamese Army, and who was being sponsored by an American\nfamily, helped him to get out of Vietnam.  For a month or so, the Applicant lived in a refugee camp\nin Pennsylvania until he was sponsored by an American family in Florida.  He later moved to Utah\nto study Geology for one semester before he decided to move California where he changed his major\nand completed his studies.  \nIn 1984, he became a naturalized United States citizen.  He decided that he wanted to make\nthe United States his permanent home because of the opportunities available to him in this country.\nThe Applicant has been married twice, both of his wives are Vietnamese.  His current wife is a\nnaturalized United States citizen and is employed as a high school English teacher.  The Applicant\n\n3\nhas one child and four step-children.  His step-children are all grown and are currently employed in\nlocal government or private industry in the United States.  The Applicant\u2019s only son recently\ngraduated from the University of Texas, with high honors and is planning to attend medical school.\nFrom 1975 until 1990, the Applicant had no contact whatsoever with his family in Vietnam.\nIn 1990, through a friend of the Applicant\u2019s, the Applicant received a letter from his father and he\nbegan to write him.  In 1993, his father passed away.  The Applicant continued to write his mother\nin Vietnam about twice a year and he sent her money on the holidays.  In May 2006, his mother\npassed away.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \n     \nThe Applicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens of and reside in Vietnam.  His sisters are elderly and\nnow retired.  One of them used to work as a nurse\u2019s assistant, the other was a teacher.  They are now\nsupported by their children in Vietnam, who are a physician and an Engineer.  Presently, the\nApplicant\u2019s only contact with his sisters is about once or twice a year on holidays at the most.     \nThe Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, who was also a citizen and resident of Vietnam, passed away\nin 1983.  After his death, his wife, the Applicant\u2019s mother- in-law, immigrated to the United States.\nShe passed away about fifteen years ago.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C).      \nThe Applicant traveled to Vietnam in 1992, to visit his father, whom he had not seen since\n1975.  He traveled to Vietnam again in 2000 and in 2002 to visit his ailing mother.  On each\noccasion, he stayed about three weeks.  In 2006, when his mother passed away, he traveled there in\norder to make her funeral arrangements.  The Applicant had no contact with anyone from the\nVietnamese Government during any of his visits to Vietnam.  \nThe Applicant has no property, bank accounts, or assets of any kind in Vietnam and no\nintention of ever returning to Vietnam in the future.  He has no intent of ever helping anyone to\nimmigrate from Vietnam to the United States.  \nThree witnesses, including his Project Manager, Facility Security Officer and his wife\ntestified on behalf of the Applicant.  They believe that he is an excellent worker and a responsible\nperson.   \nLetters of recommendation submitted by the Applicant\u2019s Manager, Security Officer, Team\nLead, and a coworker collectively indicate that the Applicant is highly regarded in the work place.\nHe is considered hardworking, conscientious and displays great attention to detail.  He is extremely\ndependable, and has been asked to work on some of the most difficult projects that the company\nundertakes.  He displays great integrity in his work and particularly under pressure situations and\ntight deadlines and has always properly protected classified information.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nD, E, F and G).   \nI have taken official notice of the fact that Vietnam is a communist country and that its\npolitics, society and human rights records remain inconsistent with United States system of\ndemocracy and freedom.  It is also noted that the Applicant escaped Vietnam to avoid the impact of\ncommunism and to enjoy the liberties and opportunities the United States offers.  \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this guideline should consider th\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7. (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8. (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which therse persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n8. (b) there is not conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. , that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U. S interest; \n8. (c) contact or contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes\ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or\nnexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard\nclassified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\n\n6\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates that he has foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The mere\npossession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be\ncounted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The\nGovernment must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide\nby all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and\nhaving assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes\nthat the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's\nforeign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified\ninformation.  \nWith respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is not vulnerable to foreign\ninfluence.  Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure\nor coercion applies.  However, Mitigating Conditions 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with\nforeign person, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.; 8.(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government or country is minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. , that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U. S interest; and, 8(c)\ncontact or contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation are applicable. \nTwenty-three years ago, the Applicant fled Vietnam for fear of communism and chose the\nUnited States as his permanent home.  He has been a loyal and dedicated United States citizen for\nmore than twenty-two years. Although the Applicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens and residents of\nVietnam, neither of them are associated with the Vietnamese government or any government, nor\nare they in a position to place foreign influence on the Applicant, or in a position to be exploited by\nthe Vietnamese Government or any government in a way that could force the Applicant to choose\nbetween loyalty to them and loyalty to the United States.  Therefore, I conclude that it would be\nunlikely that the Applicant would ever consider any attempt at exploitation.  Furthermore, the\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign relatives are very limited, and are not of a nature to influence\nhis security worthiness.  The Applicant has cut all of his ties with Vietnam, except his once or twice\na year contact with his two elderly sisters.  The Applicant has made it clear that he understands his\n\n7\nresponsibility to the United States in holding a security clearance.  Based on the foregoing, the\nApplicant does not raise a security concern and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.   \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline\nB of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subparas.    1.a.: \nFor the Applicant \n1.b.: \nFor the Applicant\n1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\n1.d.:     For the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR was received by the DOHA on January 9, 2008. Applicant admitted\nall SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 1, 2008. That\nadministrative judge caused a notice of hearing to be issued on March 3, 2008, scheduling\nthe hearing for April 7, 2008. The case was reassigned to me on April 7, 2008, due to the\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 23, 2008\n\n2\nunavailability of the originally assigned administrative judge. I conducted the hearing as\noriginally scheduled. \nThe government submitted 13 documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-13. GE 1-3 were admitted into the record without objection.\nAdministrative notice was taken of the contents of GE 4-13 without objection. Department\nCounsel submitted a document containing written comments on the contents of GE 4-13\nfor my consideration which was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex. I) and made part of\nthe record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted nineteen documentary\nexhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-19, and admitted into the record\nwithout objection. The transcript was received on April 17, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 39-year-old man who has been employed as a linguist by a defense\ncontractor since April 2004. Applicant possessed an interim security clearance from the\ntime he was hired in April 2004 until the SOR was issued in November 2007. No\nallegations have been made that Applicant has ever mishandled or risked the compromise\nof classified information. \nApplicant worked as a linguist with U.S. military forces serving in Iraq from June\n2004 until April 2005. His duties included riding in roving military vehicles with military\nsecurity forces outside secure areas to serve as a translator when Iraqi nationals and other\nArab speaking individuals were to be questioned. In that role, Applicant was exposed to\nthe constant threat of encountering improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Additionally, he\nwas exposed to the constant threat of direct and indirect fire from enemy forces both while\non those patrols and within military bases in Iraq. One of Applicant\u2019s friends was killed\nwhile serving in Iraq.\nApplicant has served as a linguist with U.S. military forces in another middle eastern\ncountry since completing his assignment in Iraq. American military officers and senior\nnoncommissioned officers who served with Applicant and who have had the opportunity\nto work closely with him wrote the following: \nprofessional and courteous (and) willing to go the extra step to get the\nmission accomplished (AE 6); \nhis poise and rapport with both American and foreign officials was integral\nin continuing the support for the war-fighters in both Iraq and Afghanistan\n(and) his trustworthiness, professionalism, and selfless sacrifice were\nunwavering )and he) has always demonstrated a dedication to the United\nStates, even to the point of leaving his family behind to perform duties with\nthe United States military during wartime\u201d (AE 7); \n\n3\nI can personally attest to his outstanding work ethic and flawless character\n(he) stands shoulder to shoulder with other professionals in supporting our\ncountry\u2019s beliefs and principles (AE 8);\n . . . he has done wonders to foster a [sic] positive relations between US and\nhost nation forces (AE 9); \nDuring my tenure as supervisor of (Applicant), I found him to be an extremely\nreliable interpreter and he always displayed the coveted characteristics of\nhonesty and dependability (AE 12); and \nHe constantly displays integrity, service and excellence as he carries out his\nassigned duties with vigor . . . . He is a man of honor, character and passion\nas this unit has been a part of his life for several years . . . . I have the utmost\nfaith and trust in him and do not doubt his ability to maintain his security\nclearance in accordance with the intended use in support of the Department\nof Defense. He is, without a doubt, a loyal and dedicated employee who\nworks side by side with members of our United States Air Force, displaying\nthe same level of dedication, commitment, pride and patriotism. One team -\none fight! (AE 13) \nApplicant has earned a number of certificates and letters of appreciation and recognition\n(AE 14 & 16) and others mementos (AE 19) in consideration of the support he has\nprovided to U.S. military forces and personnel.\nApplicant entered the United States from Sudan in 1993 on a visitor\u2019s visa that\nallowed him to remain in the U.S. for six months. He overstayed the visa and did not exit\nthe U.S. as required. He married a United States citizen in October 1995, and became a\nnaturalized U. S. citizen on August 22, 2001. This marriage ended by divorce in October\n2002. Department Counsel\u2019s questioning of Applicant and Applicant\u2019s answers suggest the\nfirst marriage may have been intended to allow him to gain U. S. citizenship. However,\nthere is no evidence to support such a finding.\nApplicant worked as a cashier in a convenience store from April 1993 to February\n1997. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in February 1997, but received an entry level separation\nin April 1997, based on a medical condition. Applicant worked as a cab driver, as a pizza\ndelivery man, and as a cashier from April 1997 until he was hired by his present employer.\nApplicant married a Sudanese woman in Sudan in March 2003. He has a four-year-\nold child and an eight-year-old stepchild from this marriage. His wife and stepchild are\nSudanese citizens with U.S. permanent resident alien status. His child is a U.S. citizen.\nApplicant\u2019s wife has applied for U.S. citizenship and his stepchild will automatically gain\nU.S. citizenship along with his wife. Applicant, his wife, and children reside together in the\nmiddle eastern country where he has been assigned by his employer.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, two brothers, and five sisters are all citizens and\nresidents of Sudan. His father is a retired cook who now drives a taxi cab part-time. The\nentire family resides together in the same house. Applicant\u2019s siblings, with the apparent\n\n4\nexception of one sister, are students. Applicant described the family support situation as\nhim having supported his one sister until she completed her education and she is now\nresponsible for supporting the other family members. (Tr. 86-87) None of Applicants family\nmembers in Sudan have ever been a member of the military or employed by the Sudanese\ngovernment. \nApplicant visited Sudan for six months in 2000 to care for his ailing father. He\nvacationed there for two months in 2001, and returned for three months in 2003, during\nwhich visit he married his present wife. Since working for his current employer and being\nstationed in the middle east, Applicant has visited his family in Sudan on four occasions,\nwith the most recent visit occurring in October 2007. Applicant notified his supervisors on\neach occasion before traveling to Sudan and was granted permission for the travel. He was\nbriefed before and debriefed after each trip to Sudan. Applicant telephones his parents\nabout twice a month.\nApplicant has possessed a U.S. passport since August 2001. He destroyed his\nSudanese passport once he became a U.S. citizen and considers the destruction of that\npassport to be the equivalent of renunciation of his Sudanese citizenship. He credibly\ndenies any sense of loyalty or obligation to Sudan and has expressed a willingness to\nnever travel there again if such travel would interfere with his present employment. As\nApplicant explained at the hearing, he has done everything he can for his family members\nin Sudan, he must maintain his current job to provide his wife and children a better life, and\nhe will not under any circumstance travel to Sudan in the future. (Tr. 48) Applicant does,\nhowever, hope to be able to eventually sponsor his entire family\u2019s immigration into the U.S.\n(Tr. 83-85) \nApplicant does not have any assets in Sudan. He earns about $4,100 per month\nfrom his employment. He has minimal financial assets in the United States, consisting of\nabout $7,000 in a pension plan. (AE 1) His savings consists of approximately $30,000\nworth of gold he has accumulated. (Tr. 98)\nSudan was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the U. S. Department of\nState on August 12, 1993. (GE 9) It backed Iraq when it invaded Kuwait and provided\nsanctuary and assistance to Islamic terrorist groups. In the early to mid-1990s, Carlos the\nJackal, Osama bin Laden, Abu Nidal, and other terrorist leaders resided in Sudan, and in\n1997, the U. S. imposed comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against\nSudan. In August 1998, in the wake of East Africa embassy bombings, the U. S. launched\ncruise missile strikes against Sudan. (GE 4) \nThe U.S. and Sudan entered into a bilateral dialogue on counter-terrorism in May\n2000, and Sudan has provided cooperation against international terrorism since the\nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorism attacks in the U.S. However, while Sudan publicly\nsupported the international coalition actions against al Qaida and the Taliban, it criticized\nthe U.S. strikes in Afghanistan and opposed a widening of the effort against international\nterrorism. (GE 4) On September 6, 2007, the U. S. Department of State warned travelers\nthat the U.S. had received indications of terrorist threats aimed at American and western\ninterests in Sudan. ( GE 6)       \n\n Applicant testified his family lives two to three thousand miles from Darfur and have never\n2\nexperienced the type of trouble that exists in that region of Sudan.

Numerous villages of African\ntribes were razed and acts of torture and violence were directed against women by\ngovernment forces and others. Security remains a major problem in the region and reports\nof violence were increasing during the latter half of 2006.  (GE 8)\n2\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B (foreign influence) with\nits disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n The Appeal Board has stated: As a general rule, an applicant\u2019s prior history of complying with\n13\nsecurity procedures and regulations is considered to be of relatively low probative value . . . . (citations\nomitted) However, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, where\nthe applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance with security procedures\nand regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s wife and stepchild are citizens of Sudan. They have permanent resident\nalien status in the United States and reside with him in the middle eastern country where\nhe has been assigned by his defense contractor employer. His parents and siblings are all\ncitizens and residents of Sudan. Applicant traveled to Sudan on numerous occasions\nbetween 2000 and 2007 to care for his father, to marry his wife, and to visit with his\nrelatives. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 7(a): contact with a foreign family member . . . or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nand DC 7(d): sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion apply. \nApplicant credibly testified to his unwavering loyalty to the United States and lack\nof any sense of loyalty or obligation to Sudan. His testimony is strongly supported by the\nnumerous letters of recommendation submitted by U.S. military officers and senior\nnoncommissioned officers who have worked closely with Applicant for the past several\nyears. It is further supported by his demonstrated willingness to place his life on the line\nin support of the U.S. military effort in Iraq while possessing an interim security clearance.13\n\nmade a significant contribution to national security. (citations omitted) The presence of such circumstances\ncan give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report\nattempts at coercion or exploitation. \nW hen an \u201cApplicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S.,\n[his behavior] constitute[s] important evidence that Applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. could\nbe sufficiently strong that he [could] be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Directive\n\u00b6 E2.8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (Applicant\u2019s work as an interpreter in\nAfghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant\ncontribution to the national security.\u201d) ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr 9, 2008)\n7\nMitigating Condition (MC) 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person . . . is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. applies.\n \nAdditionally, Applicant has complied with his employer\u2019s reporting requirements, has\nnotified the employer before his travels to Sudan to visit with family members, and has\nobtained the express approval of the responsible persons before undertaking such travel.\nMC 8(d): the foreign contacts and activities . . . are approved by the cognizant security\nauthority applies.\n \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.  \nApplicant is entitled to substantial consideration under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nFor a period of ten months he placed himself in harm\u2019s way by deploying to Iraq and\nengaging in routine patrols outside secure areas with U.S. military units. He has continued\nto serve in another middle eastern country with U.S. military forces and has earned high\npraise and support of many military members. He has been recognized on many occasions\nby the presentation of certificates and letters of appreciation and commendation and other\nmementos. Having observed his appearance, demeanor and manner of testifying, I find\nhis assertions of undivided loyalty to the United States to be credible. Applicant is\nadditionally entitled to credit for the work ethic he has displayed as evidenced by his 15\nyears of uninterrupted employment since immigrating to the United States. His conduct in\noverstaying a visitor\u2019s visa and remaining in the U.S. after his required date of departure\nis overwhelming outweighed by the totality of his actions since he immigrated to the U.S.\nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has mitigated the foreign\ninfluence security concern that existed in this case. He has overcome the case against him\nand satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline B is decided for Applicant. It is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

TUIDER \n \n \nAPPEARANCES \n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nJohn B. Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in 1990. He was able to mitigate \nforeign preference concerns as a result of dual citizenship and holding a Taiwanese passport. \nHowever, he was unable to mitigate foreign influence concerns of a result of his close and frequent \ncontacts with his parents and two brothers, who are resident citizens of Taiwan. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \n1\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn May 19, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).1 On \nDecember 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 \n \n The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference), and B \n(Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on April 26, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record. On May 24, 2007, Department \nCounsel requested to have the case converted to a hearing pursuant to Paragraph E.3.1.7, \nAdditional Procedural Guidance, of the Directive. The case was assigned to me on June 29, \n2007. On August 3, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on \nSeptember 18, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \n  The Government offered one document, which was admitted without objection as \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1. The Applicant offered six documents, which were admitted without \nobjections as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. I held the record open to afford Applicant \nadditional opportunity to submit additional material.  Applicant timely submitted additional \ndocuments, which were admitted without objection as AE G. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non September 26, 2007. \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibits (Exs.) IA \nthrough X. Without objection from Applicant, I took administrative notice of the documents \noffered by Department Counsel, which primarily pertained to Taiwan. (Tr. 9-13).  \n \n                                                          \n1GE 1.(Security Clearance Application is dated May 19, 2005, on the signature page). For convenience, the \nsecurity clearance application in this decision will be called an SF 86.    \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing \napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, \nas amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \n2\n\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. \n02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nThe most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are \neither well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts \npertaining to Taiwan were derived from Exs. IA through X as indicated under subheading \n\u201cTaiwan\u201d of this decision. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He was born in the Taiwan in 1962, where he was raised.  He \nattended college in Taiwan and was awarded a bachelor of science degree majoring in electrical \nengineering in May 1986. Tr. 53-54. Applicant served two years of mandatory military service in \nthe Taiwanese Army from 1986 to 1987. He served as a member of the military police and \nachieved the rank of sergeant. Tr. 45-46, 67-68. \n \nIn May 1990, at age 27, Applicant emigrated to the U.S. He came to the U.S. on an H-1, \nwork visa, and was later granted permanent resident alien status (green card). He attended \ngraduate school in the U.S. from July 1990 to June 1992, and was awarded a master\u2019s degree in \ncomputer science in June 1992. Tr. 36. He married his wife in July 1996. She like him was born \nin Taiwan. Applicant and his wife have to U.S. born children, a 14-year-old daughter and an \neight-year-old son.  \n \nApplicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens in May 2003. Applicant has held \na U.S. passport since May 2005.  Applicant\u2019s wife attended the same U.S. graduate school as \nApplicant and was also awarded a master\u2019s degree in computer science. Applicant\u2019s wife works \nfor a major search engine company as a senior database engineer. Tr. 37. Since February 2005, \nApplicant has worked for a defense contractor and is currently employed as a senior software \nengineer. He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his employment. \n \nApplicant exercises dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S. Applicant acquired his \nTaiwanese citizenship as a result of his birth in Taiwan to Taiwanese parents. Applicant has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. Tr. 47-48. SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nApplicant had an active Taiwanese passport issued in February 2002 expiring in February \n2012. Applicant submitted documentation that he surrendered and destroyed his Taiwanese \npassport in the presence of his Facility Security Officer on April 24, 2007. Tr. 47-52, Response \nto SOR. SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \n3\n\nApplicant\u2019s parents are resident citizens of Taiwan. His father is 75 years old and his \nmother is 73 years old. His parents are retired. His father owned a furniture factory and his \nmother helped his father in the business. Neither parent worked for the Taiwanese government. \nNeither parent receives a pension from the Taiwanese government. However, because of a leg \ninjury, Applicant\u2019s father receives modest benefits such as transportation discounts. Applicant\u2019s \nparents are mobile, financially self-sufficient, and able to take care of themselves. Applicant \ndescribes his relationship with his parents as \u201cclose\u201d and telephones them every weekend. \nOccasionally, he e-mails his parents with pictures of his children. Applicant regularly sends his \nparents gifts on holidays. Tr. 38, 40-41, 44-45, 59-65. SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers, ages 43 and 41, are resident citizens of Taiwan. His older \nbrother is a teacher in a private school and his younger brother is an engineer. Neither brother \nworks for the Taiwanese government. Applicant\u2019s contact with his brothers is \u201cevent driven\u201d \nversus the weekly contact he has with his parents. Applicant also describes his relationship with \nhis brothers as \u201cclose.\u201d Both of Applicant\u2019s brothers received higher education in the U.S. His \nolder brother completed most of the requirements for a Ph.D. in civil engineering. His younger \nbrother completed a Ph.D. in chemistry. Tr. 38-41, 43, 59-63, 65. SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are resident citizens of Taiwan. His father-in-law is 73 years \nold and his mother-in-law is 72 years old. Both of his in-laws are retired. His father-in-law \nworked for a bank that was at one time affiliated with the Taiwanese government, but later went \nprivate. His mother-in-law was a housewife. Both his in-laws live off a private company pension \nand their savings. Applicant described his wife\u2019s relationship with her parents as \u201cclose.\u201d She \ntelephones her parents every weekend. Tr. 40-42, 44, 63, 66-67. SOR \u00b6 2.c. \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan for family visits in June 2000, April 2001, August 2003, \nand June 2004. Tr. 42-44. SOR \u00b6 2.d. Applicant\u2019s mother visited him in the U.S. in 2005. Tr. 43. \n \nApplicant is heavily involved in his community and does volunteer work at nursing \nhomes, a hospice, an abuse shelter, and helps the blind.

Applicant and his family enjoy \na comfortable middle class suburban life. He and his wife earn a joint annual income of $230k. \nApplicant estimates his net worth which includes his home, live insurance savings account, \nmutual funds, 401Ks, checking and savings accounts to approximate $1 million.

AE  A through G.  \n \nTaiwan3 \n \nIn 1949, two million refugees fled from a civil war in mainland China to the island of \nTaiwan and established a separate, provisional capital for a government under Chiang Kai-shek.  \nThat same year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC or China).   The PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is \nonly \u201cone China.\u201d \n                                                          \n3 The contents of the Taiwan section are from Exs. I through XII. \n \n4\n\n \n5\n   \n \nSince in 1949, trade, human rights, and regional issues have dominated U.S.-Sino \nrelations, with particular disagreement on the status of Taiwan.  Although the United States long \nrecognized Taiwan\u2019s independence, on January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the \ngovernment of the PRC as the sole legal government of China.  The U.S. does not support \nindependence for Taiwan and is committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d under the Taiwan Relations \nAct, signed into law on April 10, 1979.  \n \n \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party, and \npossesses a large and increasingly sophisticated military, including strategic nuclear weapons \nand missiles.   The Intelligence Threat Handbook notes that \u201c[t]he United States is a primary \nintelligence target of China because of the U.S. role as a global superpower; its substantial \nmilitary, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a developer of \nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of \nAmericans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence targets by the PRC.\u201d  The \nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission made the following \u201cKey Finding\u201d in \nits 2006 report to Congress: \n \nChina makes a concerted effort to modernize its military by obtaining military-\nrelated systems and technologies from other countries, particularly Russia.  China \nuses legal and illegal means, including espionage, to obtain such technologies \nfrom the United States. \n \n \nThe PRC\u2019s Military Intelligence Department, First Bureau, is responsible for collecting \nmilitary information about the United States and Taiwan.  The PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security \nis the \u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and it maintains intelligence \noperations in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals with \nHong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan connections. \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy that has significant economic contacts with mainland \nChina, and it has developed a strong economy since its separation from the PRC.  However, \nTaiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the PRC, prompting the \ndevelopment of Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. \n  \n \nTaiwan, also, is an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence.  The 2000 Annual \nReport to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, prepared by \nNational Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), lists Taiwan \u2013 as well as China \u2013  as being among \nthe most active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.   This report highlights \nspecific incidents wherein Taiwan stole proprietary information and engaged in attempts to \nacquire export-restricted products. \n    \n \nThese collection activities are ongoing, as evidenced by the January 2006 conviction and \nfour-year prison sentence of Jonathan C. Sanders on charges related to the theft of sensitive and \nproprietary information by and for Taiwan companies.  Additionally, in December 2005, Donald \nKeyser, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pled \nguilty to illegally removing classified materials and to providing false statements to the U.S. \n\n \n \n6\nGovernment.  Mr. Keyser was engaged in a personal relationship with an intelligence officer \nemployed by the National Intelligence Bureau, the foreign intelligence agency of the government \nof Taiwan, and he regularly communicated with her by telephone, by email, and in person. \n \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an administrative \njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to \nClassified Information\u201d (Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole \nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the \nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information will be resolved in \nfavor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \n                                                          \n4 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the \npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from \nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n\n \n \n7\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is because of this special \nrelationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those \nindividuals to whom it grants access to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail \nto protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree \nof legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express \nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order \n10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \n \nGuideline \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign preference\u201d stated, \n\u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are \nharmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \n \nGuideline \u00b6 10 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember; and \n \n(a)(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n                                                          \n \n5\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n \n8\n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions as \nit pertains to Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship with Taiwan and possession of a current Taiwanese \npassport, and the burden shift to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nAss previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 11 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) \ndual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or  birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) \nthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; \nand \n \n(e) \nthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \n \nGuideline \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), (b), and (e) apply in this case. Applicant\u2019s Taiwanese citizenship is \nbased solely on his birth to Taiwanese parents in Taiwan and he has expressed a willingness to \nrenounce his Taiwanese citizenship. Applicant also took affirmative steps to comply with \nGuideline \u00b6 11(e). He destroyed his Taiwanese passport in the presence of his Facility Security \nOfficer. \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n  \nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \nthat is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \n \nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that \ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n\n \n \n9\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information; \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent contacts with his parents and two brothers, \nwho are resident citizens of Taiwan.  Applicant visited his family four times in Taiwan since \n2000 and his mother visited him in the U.S. one time in 2005. His wife also has frequent contacts \nwith her parents in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his immediate family creates a \nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because Taiwan has an active \ncollection program.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions as \nit pertains to Applicant\u2019s family, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the Government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply to his relationships with his parents and two \nbrothers. Applicant maintains frequent contact with these immediate relatives and describes his \nrelationship with them as close. He has also visited his family four times since 2000 and his \nmother visited him one time in 2005. These facts are indicia of the nature of his relationship with \nthese family members and such contact is not casual and infrequent.    \n \n\n \n \n10\n                                                          \nApplicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of [his immediate family members] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nHis frequent contacts with them could potentially force him to choose between the United States \nand Taiwan. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his \nrelationship with his immediate family members] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a significant \nrelationship and loyalty to the U.S. He has continuously lived in the United States since 1990. He \nand his wife became a U.S. citizen in 1990. His two children are U.S. born citizens. He received \na graduate degree in the U.S. He is heavily vested in the U.S., financially and emotionally. \n   \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed \npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person \nconcept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge \nmust not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. \nRather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors \n(APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth \nAPF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the \nmost relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the eighth APF, other \n\u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance \ndecision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s \npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  \n  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant has lived in the United States for 17 years, and he has been a naturalized citizen for \nfour years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His wife is \nalso a naturalized U.S citizen and his two children are U.S. born citizens. He has stated he would \nbe willing to willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship and has destroyed his Taiwanese \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860 \n(2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed \nin isolation). \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth APF \napparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, \n2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding \ngrant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for exploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-\n00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person \nanalysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n \n11\npassport. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to \nthe U.S. He takes his loyalty to the U.S. very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a \ndefense contractor for two years. All his financial ties are in the U.S. No derogatory evidence \nwas developed against him. \n \nFour circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First, Taiwan\u2019s \ngovernment is a rival of the U.S. See discussion under \u201cTaiwan.\u201d More importantly for security \npurposes, Taiwan actively seeks classified and industrial/economic information. Taiwan may \nattempt to use his immediate relatives who live in Taiwan to obtain such information. Second, \nApplicant had significant connections to Taiwan before he emigrated to the U.S. in 1990 at age \n27. He was born there and spent his formative years there. Third, he has immediate family \nmembers consisting of his parents and two brothers and in-laws, who are resident citizens of \nTaiwan. Fourth, Applicant has frequent and non-casual contact with his immediate relatives as \nevidenced by his frequent telephone and e-mail contact as well as his four visits to Taiwan since \n2000. His mother also visited his family in 2005. These contacts are manifestations of his strong \naffection and regard for his immediate family members, especially his parents. \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it is deemed best to err \non the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign \ninfluence.  This is a close case, but ultimately the evidence leaves me with doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and supporting evidence, my \napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. \nFor the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 b.: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n          \n  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n                                                          \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

He did not list them, as required, on a 2005 security clearance application.\nDuring the past year, he satisfied one in its entirety, and has made a good-faith effort to satisfy the\nothers. His security clearance omissions were the result of a clerical error instead of an intent to\nconceal any financial information. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations and personal\nconduct security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on July 22, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2007. On August 14, 2007, DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing scheduling it for September 13, 2007. During the hearing, I received four  government\nexhibits, 15 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on\nSeptember 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR except subparagraph 1.b, and they are\nincorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 56-year-old man with two adult children. He has been divorced since 1994.\nHe is a U.S. Air Force veteran, serving from 1971 until retirement in 1997. Since then, he has\nworked for a defense contractor as an aircraft electrician. He earned two years of college credits in\nthe early 1970s.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in his community. According to his supervisor,\nhe is a man of high integrity (Exhibit F). A former Air Force colleague characterized him as \u201cone\nof the most honest people [she] has ever met(Exhibit E).\nAs of January 2007, Applicant owed three creditors approximately $13,500 in delinquent\ndebt (Answer). Approximately $2,500 is owed on a department store credit card he used to purchase\na washing machine and dryer (subparagraph 1.a). The other two debts, as listed in subparagraphs\n2.b and 2.c, constitute miscellaneous credit card charges.\nApplicant did not have any financial problems until after his divorce in 1994. He then had\ndifficulty balancing his credit card payments with his child support obligations (Tr. 25). By\napproximately 2001, his accounts had grown delinquent. He initially attempted to resolve them at\nthat time, but stopped after growing frustrated with the collection agents (Tr. 27).\nIn January 2007, Applicant resumed negotiating with creditors to satisfy the delinquencies.\nHe satisfied subparagraph 1.b (Letter from Collection Agency to Applicant, dated February 9, 2007,\n\n3\nas included in Answer at 4). Also, he successfully negotiated a reduced amount for subparagraph\n1.a (Letter from Collection Agent to Applicant, dated January 30, 2007, as included in Answer at\n2), and he agreed to satisfy subparagraph 1.c with $50 monthly payments (Letter from Creditor to\nApplicant, dated January 31, 2007, as listed in Answer at 5). He has been making scheduled\npayments since February 2007 (Exhibits L through O).\nApplicant has approximately $134,000 invested in a 401K savings account. As of the date\nof the hearing, he had an outstanding loan balance of $143 against it. Once he satisfies the balance,\nhe is going to borrow $10,000 from his 401K account, and use it to satisfy 1.a and 1.c in their\nentirety (Tr. 47).\nApplicant does not own any credit cards. He makes $90,000, and has approximately $400\nremaining each month after expenses (Tr. 47). \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86)in 2005. He did not list any of\nhis delinquencies in response to Question 38 (Your Financial Delinquencies -180 days In the last\n7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), and Question 39 (Your Financial\nDelinquencies - 90 days Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?). Before\ncompleting the SF 86, he completed a handwritten rough draft which he gave a secretary to input\ninto a computer (Exhibit K). He disclosed four delinquencies including one listed in the SOR. The\nsecretary inputted the information from the rough draft into the computer, but overlooked financial\ninformation (Tr. 48). When she returned it to Applicant, he signed it without proofreading it (Id.).\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n1\n4\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline E -Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n1\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and FC DC\n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s began struggling financially after\na 1994 divorce. His debts began growing delinquent approximately six years later. He did not take\nconcrete steps to resolve them until 2006. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC)\n20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, does not apply.\nNevertheless, Applicant satisfied one of the debts in its entirety, has been making payments\non another for eight months, and is in the process of borrowing enough money from his 401k plan\nto satisfy the remaining debts in their entirety. He no longer uses credit cards, and has $400 of\nremaining monthly income after expenses have been paid. FC MC 20 (c): the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control, and FC MC 20 (d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, apply.\n\n5\nAny negative inference generated by the length of time that elapsed before Applicant began\nto satisfy them is greatly outweighed by the applicable mitigating conditions. Applicant began\ngetting his finances under control approximately six months before the issuance of the SOR.\nMoreover, he testified persuasively about the frustration with the collection agencies that stalled his\nefforts at resolving the delinquencies six years ago. He has mitigated the financial considerations\nsecurity concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s omission of the delinquencies from his SF 86 raises the issue of whether\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities, applies. Applicant listed financial delinquencies on an SF 86 rough draft that were\nomitted from the final draft because of a clerical oversight. His failure to proofread before signing\nthe SF 86 that the secretary typed was an honest mistake. FC DC 16 (a) does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after a 1994 divorce. He ignored them for\napproximately six years. However, within the past eight months, he has renewed efforts at debt\nsatisfaction. One is satisfied, another is being paid through a plan, and a third will be satisfied as\nsoon as a 401k loan is executed. Evaluating Applicant\u2019s current financial status, his recent track\nrecord, and his strong character, I am confident he will eliminate the remaining debt as promised.\nThe potential for coercion and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence are minimal. Clearance\nis granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\n\n6\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 16, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline B had not been mitigated.     In support of that contention, Applicant essentially restates\n1\nthe facts of his case and argues that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence, by failing to give adequate\nconsideration to the favorable evidence.  Based upon the record as a whole, Applicant asserts that\nthe security concerns presented by his ties to Taiwan were outweighed by his ties to the United\nStates.  Applicant also argues that the Judge erred with respect to several of her findings and that her\noverall unfavorable conclusion is inconsistent with other hearing-level decisions in which applicants\nin ostensibly similar circumstances had been granted a clearance.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nWe have considered the challenged findings in light of the record and conclude they are\nbased on substantial evidence.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings as to his circumstances of security concern, and the inferences drawn from those\nfindings, do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence. \nApplicant points to several hearing-level cases by the Judge which he contends support\ngranting him a clearance.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases. See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-05903 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions\nin other hearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile her decision in this\ncase with her decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2006).  \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 2.(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits . . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 2.(b).\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\n\n3\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-04371 at\n2 (App. Bd. Oct.18, 2007). \u201c Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.\u201d  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-09542 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  \u201cAn applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007). \nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant with respect to several of the factual allegations.  However, she reasonably explained why\nthe evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number\nof variables to reach a commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 2.(c).  In some instances, this\nprocess led to favorable findings for Applicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a reasonable\nconcern that Applicant's circumstances could create a conflict of interest or be used to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure him.  That concern is based on close family ties and significant financial\ninterests in Taiwan, considered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country\nvis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant offers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.\nHowever, that alternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s\ninterpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for her unfavorable\ndetermination under the disqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there\nis sufficient record evidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the\nJudge to err on the side of national security.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a native of the Republic of China (Taiwan) who became a naturalized United\nStates citizen in December 1999. He shares close bonds with his mother and brother, who are\n\n2\ncitizens of Taiwan, and reside at the Taiwanese university where his brother is a tenured professor.\nApplicant co-owns with his brother a rental apartment in Taiwan, and has funds on deposit in a\nfinancial institution in Taiwan. The Foreign Influence concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 22, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on March 7, 2007, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 14, 2007, and I convened a hearing on June 19, 2007,\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and eight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H)\nwere admitted, and testimony was taken from Applicant. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was\nreceived on June 28, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn May 4, 2007, the government requested the assigned DOHA administrative judge take\nadministrative notice of several facts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\nApplicant filed a response to the government\u2019s request on June 7, 2007, objecting to taking\nadministrative notice of \u201ccertain statements characterized as facts,\u201d including that Taiwan \u201cmaintains\nclose ties to China,\u201d and to consideration of certain publications he submits are not relevant.\nApplicant also submitted alternative facts for administrative notice.\nAuthority to consider the requests is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and\nevidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner). Before the\nintroduction of any evidence at the hearing, I allowed the government, over Applicant\u2019s objection,\nto amend its request for administrative notice to indicate that Taiwan has \u201csignificant economic and\nfinancial contacts\u201d with the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) in lieu of Taiwan \u201cretains close ties\nto China.\u201d\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative\nproceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No.\n02-24875 (decided Oct. 12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative\njudge who took  administrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document\n\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2006 (I), Background Note: China, dated January 2007 (VIII),\n1\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007 (IX), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated March 19, 2007 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n2\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (III). The document was prepared for the\n3\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (VII) and\n4\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (XI). \nSee U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\n5\ndeclassified version dated January 3, 1999 (X).\nThe press releases (IV) and (V) were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan actively pursues\n6\ncollection of U.S. economic and propriety information.  Neither case involves Applicant personally. The April 18, 2006,\npress release (IV) concerns the sentencing of a U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft between December\n1999 and December 2001 to the benefit of a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no evidence of that Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment was involved in, or sanctioned the criminal activity. The January 22, 2007 (V) press release concerns the\nsentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for, in part, making false statements to the government concerning\nhis relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer and by not reporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where\nhe met with the foreign intelligence officer. \nSee U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005 (VI). The\n7\ncourt records do not pertain to any criminal charge against Applicant.\nThe criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is of questionable relevance to an assessment of Applicant\u2019s\n8\nsecurity suitability. The only matter of arguably some relevance is that involving the U.S. State Department official where\na Taiwanese intelligence official was implicated, but there is no indication that Applicant has ever been targeted.\nConcerning the Taiwanese company \u2018s attempt to acquire sensitive commercial information for competitive advantage\n(IV), there is no indication of any government sponsorship, approval, or involvement. The company is viewed as a\n3\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was\nprovided in advance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present\nalternative information for the judge to notice.\nFacts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized\nsource and relevant and material to the case before me. For source documentation the government\nrelied on publications of the Department of State;  the Congressional Research Service;  the Centre\n1\n2\nfor Counterintelligence and Security Studies;  the National Counterintelligence Center, now known\n3\nas the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive;  and a Select Committee of the United\n4\nStates House of Representatives;  two press releases reportedly from the U.S. Department of Justice;\n5\n6\nand records of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  Applicant relied on a\n7\nreport of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (104  Congress), dated June 23,\nth\n1997, and an article from U.S. News and World Report, posted on the web January 19, 2003, and\nin print edition January 27, 2003, to confirm the espionage activities of two U.S. citizens during their\nU.S. government employments.\nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and\nmateriality of the facts proposed by the parties, I took administrative notice of certain facts as set\nforth below.8\n\ncriminal actor similar to individuals who choose to violate the law. \n4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged Foreign Influence concerns because of the Taiwanese residency and\ncitizenship of Applicant\u2019s mother (\u00b6 1.a) and brother (\u00b61.b), the Taiwanese and U.S. dual citizenship\nof his sister living in the U.S. (\u00b6 1.c), Applicant\u2019s co-ownership with his brother of an apartment\nvalued at about $250,000 (US) in Taiwan (\u00b6 1.d), and Applicant having savings accounts in two\ndifferent banks in Taiwan (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the\ncitizenship and residency of his family members as alleged, the co-ownership of the apartment in\nTaiwan inherited jointly with his brother on their father\u2019s death, and that he held a certificate of\ndeposit with the financial institution in \u00b61.e, to expire in October 2007.  He had another certificate\nof deposit in the other bank until the account was liquidated in June 2006 (\u00b6 1.f). Applicant indicated\nhe was prepared to renounce his interest in the apartment in Taiwan, but assumed it would have no\nlegal effect based on his understanding that it was impossible for a non-citizen of Taiwan to transfer\nan interest in real property located in Taiwan.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the\npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take administrative notice, I make the\nfollowing relevant and material additional findings:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old principal software engineer. He earned his master of science\ndegree in chemical engineering from a private university in the U.S. in May 1985. He has been\nworking for his present employer, a defense contractor, since March 2005 and seeks a security\nclearance so that he can work on classified projects.\nApplicant\u2019s Background and Foreign Ties\nApplicant was born in February 1956 in Taiwan. His parents, natives of Taiwan, had two\nother children, a son born in 1952 and a daughter born in 1949. After earning his bachelor\u2019s degree\nfrom a university in Taiwan, Applicant completed compulsory military service in Taiwan\u2019s Army.\nApplicant served for two years as a second lieutenant. \nIn January 1983, Applicant was issued a visa to enter the U.S. by U.S. immigration officials\nin Hong Kong. Ten days later, he came to the U.S. and began graduate studies in chemical\nengineering at a private technological university. Applicant\u2019s contact with his parents in Taiwan was\nusually by letter due to the high cost of calling, but he telephoned them on occasion.\nOn finishing his master\u2019s degree, Applicant traveled to Taiwan in mid-May 1985 for his\nwedding to a Taiwanese native in mid-June. He returned to the U.S. in mid-July 1985.  It is not clear\nwhether his spouse accompanied him or entered later. Applicant started doctoral studies in chemical\nengineering but did not finish the degree. In 1987, he began studies for a master\u2019s degree in computer\nscience at the same university. In October 1987, a son was born to Applicant and his spouse.\n\nSee Tr. 89. He also indicated in response to interrogatories that he had traveled to Taiwan in November 2006\n9\nfor his mother\u2019s 80  birthday (see Ex. 2). Yet on the SF 86 (Ex. 1) her birth date is listed as November 1927, so she\nth\nwould not turn 80 until later this year. The relevant fact is that Applicant traveled in celebration of her birthday to\nTaiwan.\n5\nFollowing the unexpected death of his father in an accident April 1989, Applicant and his\nfamily returned to Taiwan. Applicant began working for a Taiwanese commercial company as a\nproject engineering leader performing off-shore computer programming for a U.S. business. In June\n1989, he traveled to the U.S. to see his academic advisor and to ship some household goods to\nTaiwan. Applicant quit his job in Taiwan in December, and in January 1990, he and his spouse and\nson returned to the U.S. permanently, as he wanted to finish his master\u2019s degree in computer science\nand enjoyed living in the U.S.\nOnce back in the U.S., Applicant began working full-time. He held software engineering\npositions with a succession of employers over the next 13 years. On January 11, 1993, he renewed\nhis Taiwanese passport. Applicant traveled to Taiwan for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral in July 1995.\nOn August 9, 1999, Applicant renewed his Taiwanese passport for another six years in case\nhe needed one. In mid-September 1999, Applicant and his spouse divorced. In December 1999,\nApplicant took the oath of U.S. naturalization, vowing to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support\nand defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or\ncivilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant took no action to formally renounce his\nTaiwanese citizenship.\nOn June 29, 2000, Applicant was issued a U.S. passport that is valid to June 28, 2010.\nApplicant listed his birthplace as Taiwan with the understanding that he would not be able to travel\nto the PRC on his U.S. passport. Applicant traveled to Europe in 2001 and 2003 on his U.S. passport.\nIn October 2003, Applicant was laid off from his job as a senior software engineer with a\ntelecommunications company. He was unemployed until March 2005, when he was hired by his\npresent employer. Before he started work, he was asked to complete a security clearance application\n(SF 86). Applicant disclosed on his March 14, 2005, SF 86 that he and his sister were U.S. residents\nwith dual citizenship (U.S. and Taiwan). He also listed that he had foreign property interests\nconsisting of a rental  apartment owned jointly by him and his brother, and savings in two separate\nbank accounts in Taiwan opened in 1989. Applicant also reported foreign employment for a\nTaiwanese company from April 1989 to December 1989, and that he held a valid Taiwanese passport\nscheduled to expire in August 2005 \u201cto visit [his] relatives in Taiwan.\u201d\nSometime in summer 2006, Applicant\u2019s brother and mother visited him in the U.S. His\nbrother was attending a conference in Canada and took the opportunity to visit Applicant at his\nhome. Applicant\u2019s mother came to the U.S. at the same time, accompanied by Applicant\u2019s nephew\nwho had been visiting in-laws in Singapore and was en route home to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s brother\nand mother stayed with Applicant during their month-long visit.\nApplicant traveled to Taiwan from November 25, 2006 to December 10, 2006, for his\nmother\u2019s 80  birthday party.  Applicant reported this foreign travel to his employer even though he\nth\n9\nwas not required to do so.\n\nThere is conflicting evidence as to whether Applicant has to establish residency as well as citizenship in\n10\nTaiwan to divest himself of real estate. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated, \u201cFrom my understanding of the\nrelevant law of Taiwan, it is virtually impossible for a non-citizen of Taiwan to transfer an interest in real property\nlocated in Taiwan.\u201d  At his hearing, he testified that in order for him to transfer the interest, he has to be a resident of\nTaiwan. (Tr. 51) While he provided a link to a government website in Taiwan, he indicated the information was in\nChinese. \n6\nAt DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant responded to foreign influence interrogatories on January 10,\n2007. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had applied for, or received, any educational, medical,\nunemployment, welfare, pension or retirement, or other financial payments, from a foreign entity\nsince becoming a U.S. citizen. He also denied voting in any foreign election since acquiring U.S.\ncitizenship. Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to current foreign financial interests, and indicated he\ninherited with his brother an apartment that is rented out, with his share estimated at $125,000 (US).\nConcerning how long he expected to hold the foreign property interest, Applicant responded maybe\nfive to ten years. He also related he held a savings account with an estimated $75,000 (US) on\ndeposit in a bank in Taiwan. The estimated net worth of his U.S. assets is $641,351.96. Applicant\nexpressed uncertainty as to whether he holds dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S.\nAs of June 2007, Applicant still owned with his brother the apartment in Taiwan that they\ninherited from their father. It had been the family residence before their father\u2019s death. Applicant is\nprepared to renounce his interest in the apartment but from what he understands, he needs to\nestablish residency/citizenship in Taiwan to obtain the seal necessary to divest himself of the\nproperty interest,  and he does not possess a valid Taiwanese passport. Applicant has not played an\n10\nactive role in the management of the apartment, and he is unaware of the extent of the rental income,\nwhich gets deposited directly into his brother\u2019s account in Taiwan. Applicant had certificates of\ndeposit totaling $75,000 in two financial institutions in Taiwan until June 1, 2006, when his mother\nclosed one of the accounts for him. The funds, which are part of his inheritance, were deposited into\nhis brother\u2019s account. Applicant testified he is not certain of the amount of the other CD although\nhe is aware it will mature on October 9, 2007. Applicant is prepared to withdraw the funds\nprematurely and accept the penalty, but only if asked to do so.\nApplicant\u2019s mother lives with Applicant\u2019s brother, who is a tenured professor of civil\nengineering at a public university in Taiwan. He earned his doctorate from a private university in the\nU.S. Applicant\u2019s brother supports himself and his mother on his salary, the rental income from the\napartment he co-owns with Applicant, and on his savings, including Applicant\u2019s liquidated\ncertificate of deposit. Applicant\u2019s brother and mother reside in living quarters at the university that\nare provided by his employer without cost to him. Applicant telephones his mother \u201cvery often,\u201d\nsometimes daily, to check on her well-being. He speaks to his brother if his brother happens to\nanswer the telephone. Applicant does not discuss his work specifically with his brother, but his\nbrother is aware of Applicant\u2019s employer and that Applicant is applying for a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s sister resides about 20 minutes drive from Applicant. She is married to a dual\ncitizen of the U.S. and Taiwan and she works as a software engineer for a financial services\ncompany. Applicant has frequent telephone contact with his sister, sometimes daily, and he sees her\nevery week or two.\n\nSee the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2006.\n11\nSee the State Department\u2019s Background Note: Taiwan.\n12\nSee the Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy\n13\nChoices, updated October 9, 2006.\nSee the National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\n14\nand Espionage 2000. In the report\u2019s appendix, Taiwan is listed as one of the seven countries who are the most active\ncollectors of targeted information and technology. The distilled opinions expressed in the report, based on a statistically\nsmall sample (the views of \u201cnearly a dozen selected Fortune 500 companies\u201d) and very dated, were afforded less weight\nthan the more recent assessments of the U.S. State Department.\n7\nApplicant owns his home in the U.S., which has an estimated value of $400,000. Applicant\nowes a mortgage balance of between $80,000 and $90,000. Applicant has accounts with three U.S.\nbanks with about $40,000 in total deposits. He also has an individual retirement account and some\nstock.  He estimates his total net worth in the U.S. at about $641,000.\nApplicant has demonstrated outstanding work habits, personal integrity, and a commitment\nto his work in his first two years on the job with the defense contractor. The task leader on his project\nhas found him to be a reliable, very professional employee. A personal friend of Applicant\u2019s from\ngraduate school described Applicant as reliable and extremely dedicated to his family.\nUntil 1986, Taiwan\u2019s political system was effectively controlled by one party, the\nKuomintang. Since ending martial law in 1987, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect\nfor human rights and create a democratic political system. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\nof Taiwan\u2019s current president is made up of largely native Taiwanese who support sovereignty for\nTaiwan. The U.S. has been committed to maintaining cultural, commercial and other nonofficial\nrelations with Taiwan since January 1979, when it formally recognized the government of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. By formal act of Congress\n(Taiwan Relations Act of 1979), the U.S. is committed to provide Taiwan with arms in support of\nTaiwan\u2019s security and stability in the region. Despite the U.S.\u2019 clear and consistent position that\nTaiwan and the PRC are part of China, U.S. commercial ties have expanded with Taiwan and the\nU.S. is supportive of Taiwan\u2019s membership in international organizations, such as the World Trade\nOrganization and the Asian Development Bank, where independent statehood is not required for\nmembership.11\nThe PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most important trading partner, but Taiwan\nmaintains a large military establishment whose primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the\nPRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan.\nTaiwan\u2019s armed forces are equipped with weapons obtained primarily from the U.S., but Taiwan has\nstressed military self-reliance in recent years that has resulted in the growth of indigenous military\nproduction.  The U.S. has sought to balance criticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan\n12\nwith periodic warnings to the Taiwan government to avoid provocative actions and cautions that\nU.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional.13\nTaiwan was reported to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000.  In\n14\nDecember 2005, a former U.S. State Department official admitted he had concealed from the\n\nSee U.S. District Court Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005.\n15\n8\ngovernment that he had a personal relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer from\n2002 to 2004 and that he had unauthorized possession of classified U.S. documents at his\nresidence.  No evidence has been presented that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain access to\n15\nindustrial espionage or classified information.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated\nor induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests,\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline\ncan and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated\nwith a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). Applicant feels close to his mother and brother in Taiwan, and\nhis contacts with them bear that out. He moved his family back to Taiwan in 1989 on his father\u2019s\ndeath to comfort his mother. After he returned with his family to the U.S., the frequency of his\ntelephone contact with his mother increased to about daily. Applicant\u2019s brother and mother visited\nhim in the U.S. as recently as last summer, and Applicant went to Taiwan in November 2006 for his\nmother\u2019s birthday. Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\n\nConcerns of a heightened risk of improper influence from the PRC were  not alleged in the SOR but argued\n16\nin the request for administrative notice.  There is no evidence Applicant has ever traveled to the PRC, that he has assets\nin the PRC, or that any relatives are citizens or residents of the PRC. Despite the increasing economic ties between the\nPRC and Taiwan, the PRC is not likely to be permitted to operate with impunity in Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s own national\nsecurity remains under constant threat from the PRC. \n9\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion), applies.16\nFurthermore, Applicant co-owns an apartment in Taiwan inherited with his brother on their\nfather\u2019s death. The apartment had been the family residence while Applicant was growing up but was\nrented out since Applicant\u2019s brother and mother had living quarters at the university as a perk of his\nbrother\u2019s academic position. Applicant has not received any of the rental proceeds, allowing his\nshare to be deposited directly into his brother\u2019s account for their mother\u2019s care. Applicant also has\na certificate of deposit in a bank account in Taiwan. When he completed the foreign influence\ninterrogatories, he listed only the savings account in \u00b6 1.e and reported a balance of $75,000. (Ex.\n2) However, he testified at his hearing that the $75,000 was the total balance of the two accounts (\u00b6\u00b6\n1.e and 1.f), including the certificate of deposit that was liquidated in June 2006 (\u00b6 1.f). Even if his\npresent balance is something less than the full $75,000, it is a substantial foreign asset. His half-share\nof the apartment valued at $125,000 (US), and the portion of the $75,000 (US) inherited from his\nfather that is still in his name in a Taiwanese bank, raise concerns under \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation).\n Although Applicant also has a close relationship with his sister, who lives about 20 minutes\ndrive from him, she enjoys the protections of U.S. citizenship because of her naturalization in July\n1998. As a resident of the U.S., she is not within physical reach of Taiwanese authorities, and there\nis nothing about her duties as a software engineer for a financial services company in the U.S. that\npresents a heightened risk.\nThe familial bond with his mother and brother is too strong to satisfy the first prong of\nmitigating condition  \u00b6 8(a)(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of\na foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). While it is\nnot clear what Applicant would do if his relatives were pressured, the risk of him being placed in a\nposition where he would have to choose between them and the U.S. is diminished somewhat by the\nfact that Taiwan does not have a hostile relationship with the U.S., and is not known to sponsor\nterrorism. Taiwan has a defense pact with the U.S., and has made considerable progress in achieving\ndemocratic elections, civil liberties, and stable, viable governmental institutions. As reported by the\nU.S. State Department, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and\ncreate a democratic political system since ending marital law in 1987. Almost all restrictions on the\npress have ended, restrictions on personal freedoms have been relaxed, and the prohibition against\norganizing new political parties has been lifted. While the U.S. does not support independence for\nTaiwan and is committed to a one China policy, under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed into law on\nApril 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself, including making available\n\n10\ndefensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. U.S. commercial ties with Taiwan have been\nmaintained and expanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to jeopardize its relationship with the\nU.S. by overly pressuring its citizens.\nHowever, even nations with a history of friendly relations do not always have the same\ninterests. Taiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As\nrecently as 2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S.\nState Department official that bears troubling implications, although no proof of, active collection\nefforts by or on behalf of the Taiwanese government. As a tenured professor of civil engineering at\na preeminent state university in Taiwan, Applicant\u2019s brother enjoys free housing for himself and\nApplicant\u2019s mother, who resides with him. He may well receive a pension benefit on his retirement\nfrom the university, although there is no evidence confirming such an interest. Applicant testified\nthat his brother has been on the academic staff of the university since he earned his doctorate degree\nfrom a prestigious private university in the U.S. in the early 1980s. His academic position  raises the\nrisk of undue foreign influence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial interests in Taiwan represent about a quarter of his net worth. Applicant\nhas not taken an active interest in those assets, allowing his mother to handle his accounts in Taiwan\nfor him and assenting to the apartment\u2019s rental fees being deposited directly into his brother\u2019s\naccount. Applicant expressed a willingness to divest himself of his interest in the apartment and to\neven cancel the certificate of deposit prematurely if necessary. He is not likely to serve Taiwan\u2019s\ninterests to protect these foreign assets for his own benefit. Yet,  I am unable to apply MC \u00b6 8(f)(the\nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are\nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure\nthe individual) because of the concern he has for the care and well-being of his mother, who is\ndirectly benefitting from his foreign assets in Taiwan.\nEven strong ties to foreign nationals can be mitigated under MC \u00b6 8(b)(there is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S. that the person can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest). Six years after he had come to the U.S. for graduate school, Applicant moved\nhis spouse and toddler son to Taiwan. He was not certain at that time whether he planned to stay in\nTaiwan or return to the U.S. His motivation in returning to the U.S. eight months later was to finish\nhis doctoral studies, but he ended up pursuing a career in the computer industry and more recently,\nin the defense industry. He became a U.S. citizen in December 1999, and acquired a U.S. passport\nin June 2000. Applicant owns the home he has lived in since December 1993, and he has other\nfinancial assets (401 (k), stock ownership, and $40,000 in bank deposits) in the U.S.\nUnder the whole-person evaluation required under the Directive (The adjudicative process\nis an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that\nthe person is eligible for a security clearance (AG \u00b6 2(a)), Applicant\u2019s record of dedicated\ncontribution to his defense contractor employer weighs in his favor. Likewise, his candor about the\nextent of his foreign ties shows that he is an ethical person. He reported his trip to Taiwan in\nNovember 2006 to his employer\u2019s security department. However, his ties to the U.S., his\ncontributions to his employer, and his candor, are not enough to mitigate the security significant\nForeign Influence issues that exist, including some (financial assets) within his control.\n\n11\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

He has a history of significant financial problems and he is currently unable to pay\nhis delinquent debts totaling more than $17,000.00. Applicant provided no information\ndemonstrating how his financial problems arose or what he has done to resolve them.  Applicant\nfailed to mitigate security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations.  He has\nnot met his burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\na security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 23, 2005, Applicant submitted an SF 86, Security Clearance Applaiction.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992) (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended; and the new\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  On February 28, 2007, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under the\nDirective, Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 26, 2007.  He elected to have the matter\ndecided without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\ndated June 7, 2007.  On June 14, 2007, Department Counsel mailed a complete copy of the FORM\nto Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  On June 20, 2007, Applicant received\nthe FORM.  He did not submit any additional materials within the specified 30-day period.  The case\nwas assigned to me on August 15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR.  (Item 3.)  Those admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.

Since 1997, Applicant has worked as an outside machinist for three federal contractors without\na significant period of unemployment.  \nIn November 2002, Applicant and his wife filed jointly for bankruptcy protection under\nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  (Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 1.)  The record does not include a copy\nof the bankruptcy documents.  The action was later dismissed.  (Item 3.)  \nIn March 2005, Applicant submitted an SF 86, Security Clearance Application.  (Item 4.)\nIn response to questions on the form, he reported the petition for bankruptcy and several financial\ndelinquencies.  (Id.)  Investigators obtained a credit bureau report, dated February 2007, that listed\nfour seriously delinquent accounts.  (Item 5.)  These include a delinquent credit card account in the\namount of $1,196.00 (SOR, \u00b6 1.b), a charged off debt to a creditor in the amount of $4,079.00 (SOR,\n\u00b6 1.c), a delinquent debt to a collection agency for $988.00 (SOR, \u00b6 1.d), and an overdue loan for an\nautomobile in the amount of $11,413.00 (SOR, \u00b6 1.e).  (Item 5.)  Applicant admitted these debts.\n(Item 3.) \nIn December 2006, security investigators requested that he respond to interrogatories.  (Item\n6.)  Applicant provided a personal financial statement showing his normal, monthly living expenses.\nHe indicated he was then unable to make arrangements to pay any of his delinquent debts.  (Id.)  \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  Conditions that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate\nsecurity concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions below.\n\n4\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 2.)  An\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in \u00b6 18\nof the new adjudicative guidelines.  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under \u00b6 19(a), an\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under  \u00b6 19(c),\n\n5\n\u201ca history of nor meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns.  As noted above,\nApplicant had significant financial problems for several years and he is currently unable to pay or\nresolve some substantial delinquent debts.  I find the available evidence raises these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised\nunder this guideline.  Paragraph 20(a) may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  The behavior in question\nis the non-payment of delinquent debts.  The financial obligations in question remain unresolved;\ntherefore, I find the behavior is recent.  It also appears there were several unpaid debts that\naccumulated over a period of time; thus, I cannot find this was an infrequent event.  Finally,\nApplicant provided no information about the origin of these debts, or any actions he has taken to\nresolve them, therefore he has failed to demonstrate they are unlikely to recur.\nUnder \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The available information indicates Applicant experienced\nseveral periods of unemployment in 1997.  It is not clear, however, whether this caused or\ncontributed to his financial problems; he was steadily employed for about four years before he filed\nfor bankruptcy, and has been employed continuously since then.  Applicant offered no statement or\nother information shedding any light on his personal circumstances, therefore I am unable to find that\nthis potentially mitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d is potentially mitigating\nunder \u00b6 20(c).  Similarly, \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  There is no information Applicant\nreceived any counseling.  Furthermore, he indicated he is unable make any payments on his\ndelinquent debts.  The evidence does not raise this potentially mitigating condition.\nWhole Person Concept\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case\nin light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of\nnational security.  I considered the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct.  The available\nevidence shows Applicant has a history of significant financial problems and he is currently unable\nto pay his delinquent debts.  Unfortunately, Applicant provided no information demonstrating how\nhis financial problems arose, or what he has done to resolve them.  For this reason, I cannot assess\nthe extent of his rehabilitation or another pertinent behavioral change, or determine the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence.  Considering all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has not met his\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security\nclearance. \n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nMichael J.

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\nApplicant is a dual U.S. and Greek citizen.  She obtained a Greek passport at age 19 that does\nnot expire until August 2008.  Applicant does not want to destroy, surrender, or invalidate her Greek\npassport because she may want to work in the European Union or in Greece at some future date and\nwould need her Greek passport to prove citizenship.  The record evidence is insufficient to mitigate\nor extenuate the negative security implications related to foreign preference. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted\nor continued due to foreign preference security concerns.\nOn March 27, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and decided to have the matter decided\nwithout a hearing. A File of Relevant Material (FORM) dated May 2, 2007 was sent to Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due 30 days after receipt of a copy of the FORM.  As of July\n17, 2007, no response had been received.  On July 19, 2007, I was assigned the case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns based on foreign preference. Applicant admits the\nfollowing: she was born a citizen of the U.S. in 1983, she was issued a Greek passport in February\n2004 that does not expire until August 2008, she exercised dual citizenship with Greece and the\nU.S., and she used her Greek passport to prove her Greek citizenship for an internship in June and\nJuly 2005. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of\nthe record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 23-year-old consultant who has worked for a defense contractor since August\n2006 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant was born in the United States in 1983.\nApplicant is a dual Greek and U.S. citizen.  Applicant\u2019s mother and father are dual Greek and U.S.\ncitizens.  Her father was a Greek citizen who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1961 and\nher mother was a Greek citizen who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2005. \nSince 1984, Applicant has gone to Greece every summer and has also traveled to Greece a\nfew times for a few weeks during the winter.  In August 2003, Applicant\u2014then age 19\u2014was issued\na Greek passport, which expires in August 2008. In June and July 2005, Applicant was a research\nassistant and summer intern at the Bank of Greece in Greece. Applicant has not used her Greek\npassport for travel but to prove citizenship for internship. She is not willing to destroy, surrender,\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n3\nor invalidate her foreign passport because she might want to work in Greece or the European Union\nin the future. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline C, foreign preference.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n4\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under foreign preference. When an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a)(1) exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to possession and/or use\nof a foreign passport.  Applicant was born in the U.S. and acquired her Greek passport at age 19.\nThe passport does not expire until August 2008.  Applicant does not wish to surrender the passport\nbecause she may need it to work in Greece or the European Union at some future date. \nNone of the foreign preference mitigating conditions (FPMC) apply. FPMC 11(a) dual\ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country, does not apply\nbecause Applicant was born in the U.S. and chose to obtain a Greek passport. FPMC 11(b)\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship, does not apply because\nApplicant does not wish to renounce her dual citizenship and may want to use her passport for future\nwork in Greece or the European Union.  Since Applicant was a U.S. citizen from birth, FPMC 11(c)\nexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor, does not apply.\nThe use of the Greek passport has not been approved by a cognizant security authority,\ntherefore FPMC (d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority, does\nnot apply. FPMC 11 (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated, does not apply because Applicant does not want to destroy,\nsurrender or invalidate the passport. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Foreign Preference: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n5\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_____________________________\nClaude R.

On February 28, 2007, under Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5200.6, with revised Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns\nraised under the criminal conduct guideline (Guideline J) of the Directive. In his notarized answer\ndated April 11, 2007, Applicant submitted responses to each SOR allegation, and requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on April 26, 2007.

On March\n27, 2007, Applicant received a statement from the program coordinator of the rehabilitation program\nchronicling his commitment to remedying the behavioral issues related to the battery of his wife. In\nthe statement, the program coordinator stated, \u201cIn my 14 years of managing the program[,] I am hard\n\n Applicant indicated in his sworn statement dated May 9, 2003 (Item 7) that he last used alcohol in February\n1\n2000. On February 1, 2007, Applicant noted in his answers to interrogatories that February 4, 2000 was the last time he\nconsumed alcohol. \n3\npressed to think of anyone who has demonstrated how to behave appropriately more than\n[Applicant].\u201d\nApplicant denied still being on probation as alleged subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR because\nhe was discharged from probation on March 29, 2007. He stated that he included a copy of the court\npapers showing he is no longer on probation. No court documents were provided. \nBetween April 1988 and February 2005, Applicant was charged with four driving offenses\nand a domestic battery of his wife. In April 1988 (subparagraph 1.g.), Applicant was charged with\ndriving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant had been drinking before the arrest.\nHe pled guilty to the charge and completed all sentence conditions. In 1995 (subparagraph 1.f.),\nApplicant pled guilty to the lesser included offense of reckless driving after being charged with DUI.\nHe completed all sentence conditions.\nIn April 1999, Applicant was charged with a misdemeanor of hit and run (subparagraph 1.e.).\nApplicant avers that one of his car tires exploded on the highway, causing his car to spin\nuncontrollably. During the spin, he hit another car but could not recall that he had. Several months\nafter the tire explosion, Applicant was charged with hit and run. He pled no contest to leaving the\nscene of an accident. He satisfied all court-conditions of his sentence. \nIn February 2000, Applicant was charged with DUI (subparagraph 1.d.). In April 2000, he\nwas found guilty of the charge, and served 45 days in jail. In his answer, Applicant noted that his last\nuse of alcohol occurred in February 2000.1\nIn his response to the government\u2019s FORM, Applicant theorized that if he represented a\ndanger to the national security, then his security clearance would have been revoked in October 2004\nafter the battery offense. He observed, \u201cAll other cases mentioned in the \u201cFile of Relevant Material\u201d\ndocument, with the exception of the 2004 battery incident, has been investigated and clearance has\nbeen granted.\u201d \nApplicant provided no other character evidence from independent sources regarding his job\nperformance, behavior away from the job, or current relations with his wife. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \n\n4\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe guideline addresses criminal activity that casts doubt on a person\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. A person who cannot comply with the law may not be a suitable candidate to\nsafeguard classified information.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal conduct (CC) raises questions about a person\u2019s judgment. If he has engaged in a\npattern of violating the law, then he may be willing to transgress selective security rules and\nregulations he chooses not to comply with. Between April 1988 and February 2000, Applicant\nengaged in four serious traffic offenses. After a four-year hiatus, Applicant committed misdemeanor\nbattery on his wife in October 2004. \nIn April 1988, Applicant was found guilty of DUI. In 1995, Applicant committed the same\noffense although he pled guilty to the lesser included offense of reckless driving. In April 1999, he\nwas found guilty of misdemeanor hit and run driving. Applicant\u2019s third DUI offense in February\n2000 cost him 45 days in jail. Finally, Applicant\u2019s battery of his wife in October 2004 required\nApplicant to complete a 52-week batterers program and 10 weeks of group parenting. Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal record between 1988 and February 2005 invokes CC disqualifying condition (DC) 31.a. (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) Because three of the five offenses between April\n1988 and February 2005 were alcohol-related, it is fair to conclude that alcohol contributed a large\npart to Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior during the period between 1988 and February 2000. With\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related driving record, he was fortunate not to have his driving privileges\nindefinitely suspended or permanently revoked. He was also fortunate to realize he could no longer\nconsume alcohol. His statements declaring abstention for seven years are credible. Therefore, CC\nmitigating condition (MC) 31. D. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) is\npartially applicable due to Applicant\u2019s cessation of alcohol use in February 2000. \n\n5\nApplicant exercised good judgment in February 2000 by ending his association with alcohol.\nYet, anger management issues apparently continued unattended until October 2004 when he hit his\nwife, and culminated in his conviction in February 2005 for misdemeanor battery. Though the 36-\nmonth sentence suggests Applicant may have done much more to his wife that just push her, there\nis insufficient evidence to infer that Applicant used more force than he claims. Moreover, the\nprogram coordinator\u2019s comments clearly show that the 52-week program inculcated positive\nadjustments in Applicant\u2019s overall behavior. As the coordinator stated, \u201cIn my 14 years of managing\nthe program[,] I am hard pressed to think of anyone who has demonstrated how to behave\nappropriately more than [Applicant].\u201d The partial mitigation Applicant receives under CC MC 32.d.\nfor seven years of sobriety is augmented by the glowing report from Applicant\u2019s program coordinator\nin March 2007 based on his successful completion of the domestic battery program. \nThe favorable result Applicant receives under the CC guideline justifies the same result when\nthe circumstances of this case are viewed in the context of the whole person model. Seven years of\nsobriety and the successful completion of 52 weeks of counseling, including 10 two-hour parenting\nsessions, persuasively demonstrates Applicant\u2019s past criminal conduct is unlikely to recur in the\nfuture. \nAn issue raised by Applicant in his response to the FORM warrants discussion. A person\u2019s\nsecurity suitability is always at issue. Even though Applicant\u2019s earlier security investigation may\nhave resulted in Applicant\u2019s favor, although it also may have lasted longer than he anticipated, the\ngovernment always has the right to launch a security investigation into a person\u2019s past criminal\nhistory, particularly when the past history includes other more recent, adverse behavior. The\ngovernment was entitled to investigate and review the security concerns of Applicant\u2019s traffic\noffenses in light of his recent misdemeanor battery offense in October 2004. \nMy overall commonsense decision gives Applicant credit for disengaging from alcohol use\nin February 2000, and also overcoming his anger issues through documented treatment for his anger\nissues and parenting deficiencies at the county rehabilitation center. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nFor the Applicant. \nSubpargraph c.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph g. \nFor the Applicant.\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

While employed full-time, he attended off-duty graduate-level classes from the fall of 2001 to the fall of 2004, worked on his thesis from 2004 to 2006, and received a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in September 2006 (Tr. 46; AX 1).

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nV. Elizabeth Powell, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant used credit cards to pay $55,000 in margin calls after a stock market downturn in\n1997.  He paid off all the credit card accounts except two in which he disputed the balance due.  He\nsuccessfully compromised one of the disputed credit card debts and the creditor withdrew its claim\nin the other.  He disputed a cell phone bill and a medical bill, and both disputes were resolved.\nSecurity concerns based on financial considerations are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\nOrdinarily, an applicant\u2019s exhibits are lettered.  However, since Applicant submitted numerous exhibits that\n1\nwere already numbered, I continued with his numbering system rather than delay the hearing to change all the numbers\nto letters.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 15, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance.  On May 10, 2007, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\nfor its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security clearance. This action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F\n(Security Considerations).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 6, 2007, admitted all but one of the\nallegations, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on\nSeptember 24, 2007.  Scheduling was delayed because Applicant had not received a response to his\nrequest for documents from the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of the Air\nForce.  After two conference calls with Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel on October 1\nand October 11, 2007, I set the hearing for October 31, 2007.  The case was heard as scheduled.  I\nheld the record open until November 16 to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary\nevidence.  I received his evidence on November 7, 2007, and it is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(AX) 9.   Department Counsel's response to Applicant's additional evidence is attached to the record\n1\nas Hearing Exhibit I.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 50-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor.  He has\nworked for his current employer since August 2001.  While employed full-time, he attended off-duty\ngraduate-level classes from the fall of 2001 to the fall of 2004, worked on his thesis from 2004 to\n2006, and received a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in September 2006 (Tr. 46; AX 1).\nHe has held a security clearance since April 1991, but it was suspended pending adjudication of his\napplication to continue it (Tr. 16).\nWhen the stock market dropped drastically in the fall of 1997, Applicant used several credit\ncards to pay about $55,000 in margin calls (Tr. 48-50).  He used credit cards because he did not have\nany equity in his home or any other available assets (Tr. 61).  He usually made the minimum required\npayments on the credit cards (Tr. 95).  He obtained extensions of time to file his income tax returns,\neven though he was due refunds.  In 2003, he filed his tax returns and used the refunds to pay off a\ncar loan and all the credit card accounts, except two that he disputed (Tr. 85-87).  \n\n3\nThe debts alleged in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d are the same credit card debt of about $17,000\n(Tr. 56-59, 64-65).  Applicant disputed this debt because he believed he was the victim of a bait-and-\nswitch.  In May 2002, he contacted the creditor, seeking a lower interest rate.  He was orally\npromised an interest rate of  3.7% on his balance and the same lower rate on $5,000 transferred from\nanother account.  When Applicant received his statement, it reflected an 8.9% rate on the transferred\nbalance and 22.98% on the original balance.  Applicant did not make the stated minimum payment\nof $255 because he regarded it as \u201cfraudulent,\u201d having been derived by applying the 22.98% rate.\nInstead, he continued to make payments of the amount he calculated as the minimum required\namount.  When he did not make the full $255 payment, the 22.98% rate was applied to his entire\nbalance.  He continued to make payments until he was interviewed by a security investigator in\nJanuary 2004 and informed the account had been charged off (Tr. 62-63).  In March 2007, he\nreceived a letter from the creditor stating the account was charged off and sold in January 2003 (AX\n4 at 10).  He was able to recoup about $500 in money orders made payable to the creditor that had\nnot been cashed.  In October 2007, after retaining a lawyer, he offered to settle the account (AX 4).\nHis offer was accepted, and he paid the agreed amount as full settlement on November 1, 2007, the\nday after the hearing (AX 9).\nThe $11,000 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e also was incurred to pay the margin calls.\nApplicant was current on his payments until he moved to another geographical location to take a new\njob and did not receive his monthly bill.  He was advised by the creditor that the account would not\nbe referred for collection if he made a double payment.  He made two double payments, but his\naccount was still charged off.  He received a settlement offer of 80 % of the balance in October 2001,\nand he responded by accepting the offer, provided that the creditor would not report the amount\ncompromised to the Internal Revenue Service as income.  He did not receive a response to his\ncounteroffer.  He filed a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in March 2007\nabout the handling of this account.  In September 2007, his lawyer again offered to settle the account.\nOn October 2, 2007, the creditor responded to the offer of settlement by stating it was \u201cunable to\nretrieve all of the necessary documentation because of the age of the account,\u201d and informed\nApplicant that \u201cthe balance of the account was removed and requests were sent to the credit bureaus\nasking that the account be deleted from his credit report.\u201d  (AX 3).  He and his lawyer construed this\nresponse as a withdrawal of the claim.\nThe $564 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a arose when Applicant moved and changed cell phone\ncompanies.  The account was placed for collection in March 2005.  Applicant thought he was being\ndouble-billed and complained to the state Attorney General.  In September 2007, after being advised\nby the Attorney General\u2019s office that debts from two separate carriers were involved, he offered to\nsettle the account.  The collection agency responded to the offer by stating it had closed the account.\nHe sent another letter to the collection agency asking whether anything else was required of him, but\nreceived no response.  (AX 5.)\nThe $163 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is reflected on Applicant\u2019s credit reports as \u201cmedical\u201d\nwith no identification of the medical provider (GX 4, 5, 6).  He learned about the alleged debt when\nhe received interrogatories from DOHA.  He contacted two medical providers to determine who was\nclaiming the debt.  He contacted a medical doctor whom he had paid in advance for his treatment,\nbut the doctor\u2019s office could not determine why he had been billed.  He also contacted a community\nhospital where he had received treatment, and he found that some of his payments had not been\nposted.  In December 2003, he offered to settle the debt but received no response (Tr. 82-83).  In July\n\n4\n2007, he made another offer to settle the debt (Tr. 83; AX 7 at 4 and 7) but received no response.\nHe filed a complaint with the state Attorney General in October 2007 (AX 7 at 1), and he wrote a\nletter to the collection agency asking that the debt be removed from his credit records (AX 6).  He\ncalled the collection agency and was informed that he need not pay the debt because it had \u201cexpired\u201d\nand was no longer collectible under local law (Tr. 77-78).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCell phone\n$564\nDisputed; claim abandoned\nTr. 70-73; AX 5\n1.b\nCredit card\n$17,177\nSettled\nAX 4 at 1; AX 9\n1.c\nCredit card\n$389\nSame debt as 1.b\nTr. 56-59, 64-65; \nAX 4 at 5, 6, 8, 13\n1.d\nCredit card\n$17,559\nSame debt as 1.b\nTr. 56-59, 64-65\nAX 4 at 5, 6, 8, 13\n1.e\nCredit card\n$11,000\nClaim withdrawn by creditor\nTr. 65-69; AX 3\n1.f\nMedical bill\n$163\nDisputed; no response to\nApplicant\u2019s offers to settle;\nclaim barred by statute of\nlimitations and abandoned by\ncollection agency\nTr. 77-78, 82-83; AX 6; \nAX 7\nIn March 2007, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories.  He reported net monthly income of $5,410.96, expenses of $1,625.29, debt\npayments of $3,047.20, and a net remainder of $2,363.76 (GX 3 at 7).  At the hearing, he testified\nhis monthly expenses had decreased by about $400, leaving a net remainder of about $2,900 (Tr. 84-\n85).  Applicant lives in a rented house.  He owns a home in another state, where he intends to retire.\nHe rented the property until it was damaged by hurricanes.  At present, he is unable to rent it due to\nunrepaired hurricane damage (Tr. 116, 120).  The mortgage payments on the property are current.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\n\n5\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concern under Guideline F is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a\nrealistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which\nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income\nratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6 19(a) and (c).  AG 19(b) is not raised because his\nindebtedness was not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, but rather by an unexpected\nfinancial reversal.  AG \u00b6 19(e) is not raised because he did not spend beyond his means, but rather\n\n6\nwas the victim of an unexpected financial setback that forced him to borrow money at high interest\nrates.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d or\n\u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of these\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d\nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established.  Although the underlying delinquent debts\nbegan several years ago, the debts were unresolved until recently.  The second prong (\u201cso\ninfrequent\u201d) also is not established, because Applicant\u2019s financial history reflects numerous\ndelinquent debts.  \nThe third prong (under circumstances unlikely to occur) is established.  Applicant was\nfinancially solvent until the market crash triggered $55,000 in margin calls.  He had no choice but\nto use high-interest credit cards to pay the margin calls.  He settled all but two of the credit card\naccounts without incident.  He perceived himself as a victim of bait-and-switch on one account, and\nas the victim of a broken telephonic promise not to charge off the other account if he made a double\npayment.  Even while disputing the accounts, he continued to make payments.  After he retained an\nattorney, he was able to resolve both accounts.  He is no longer financially overextended, and he has\nbecome much more knowledgeable about the pitfalls of credit card use.  \nThe fourth prong also is established.  Applicant has held a clearance for many years,\napparently without incident.  He was financially solvent before the market crash.  He paid off all but\ntwo credit card accounts.  The first involved in the interest-rate dispute, but he continued to make\nwhat he considered to be correct payments while pursuing the dispute.  He continued to make\npayments on the second account until he learned it was closed and his money orders were not being\ncashed.  He obtained legal advice and successful resolved all his delinquent debts.  The combination\nof the third and fourth prongs is sufficient to establish the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 29(a).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by the unexpected market crash in 1997 that\nresulted in $55,000 in margin calls.  He had no equity in his home and no other assets to pay the\nmargin calls, and so he used his credit cards, the only source of funds available.  His rental income\nfrom his home was interrupted by hurricane damage.  The market crash and the damage to his home\nwere events beyond his control.  Nevertheless, he kept up with his payments until 2001, and he\nresolved all the credit card accounts in 2003, except for the two disputed accounts.\nIn evaluating whether Applicant\u2019s conduct was reasonable, I have considered that he is an\nelectrical engineer, not a lawyer or accountant.  He fell behind at a time when he was under heavy\ntime demands, working full-time and completing the requirements for a master\u2019s degree.  He\nreasonably concluded he was the victim of a bait-and-switch marketing tactic that increased rather\nthan decreased his monthly payments.  He was understandably upset when a telephonic promise that\nthe account would not be charged off was not honored.  He continued to make payments even while\nthe two credit card accounts were being disputed.  He retained an attorney, and, with her assistance,\nresolved the two disputed accounts.  He disputed the cell phone debt and the medical bill, and both\nclaims were abandoned.  Under all the circumstances, I conclude he reacted responsibly to\ncircumstances beyond his control.  The mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 20(b) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant\u2019s problems did not stem from\nfinancial indiscipline, but from a financial catastrophe and his lack of understanding about his rights\nand obligations under his credit card contracts.  He hired a lawyer, and all his delinquent debts have\nbeen resolved.  I conclude AG \u00b6 29(c) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).  The\nconcept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness,\nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL\n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nThe evidence shows Applicant continued to pay his debts even though he was financially\nstretched.  He was attempting to resolve his credit card debts long before he applied for continuation\nof his security clearance.  He disputed what he considered to be unfair practices or unwarranted\ncharges.  He did not learn of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f until he was asked about them\nduring the adjudication process.  He promptly investigated the debts and took action to resolve them.\nIn the case of the cell phone debt, he offered settlement when he learned his perception of double\nbilling was wrong.  In the case of the two disputed credit card accounts, he continued to make\npayments while the disputes were ongoing.  He made multiple offers to settle the medical bill that\nwere ignored.  Allowing the statute of limitations to run on a debt is not necessarily \u201cgood faith,\u201d\nbut in this case the statute ran because Applicant could not find anyone who would accept his offers\nof settlement.  Eventually, the collection agency abandoned the debt.  All the debts have been\nresolved.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\n\n8\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(e).  Applicant disputed several debts.  The evidence indicates\nhis dispute of the cell phone debt was unfounded.  I cannot determine from the evidence whether\nApplicant misunderstood the terms of the low \u201cteaser\u201d rate offered on one of his credit card accounts\nor was the victim of a bait-and-switch.  Similarly, I cannot determine whether Applicant\nmisunderstood the terms and time limit for submitting a double payment or was the victim of a\nbroken telephonic promise.  The medical debt was difficult to identify because of the cryptic credit\nreport entry, but it was successfully disputed.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established only for the\nmedical debt.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult, but he was unfamiliar with intricacies of credit\ncard accounts and the pitfalls of \u201cteaser\u201d rates on transferred credit card accounts.  He has held a\nsecurity clearance for many years without incident.  He was sincere and credible at the hearing, and\nhis explanations for his financial problems were plausible.  He has resolved all his delinquent debts\nand is not vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  He is financially solvent, earns\na good income, lives modestly, and is unlikely to experience further financial problems.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

While Applicant\nhas committed to a repayment plan with one of his creditors, he is unable to document progress with\nany of his other creditors despite hearing and post-hearing opportunities to do so.  Based on the\nlimited repayment efforts he has demonstrated to date, he is unable to mitigate security concerns\nassociated with his past history of delinquent debts.  Applicant successfully refuted allegations that\nhe falsified his security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 28, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on April 30, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 24, 2007.  A hearing was\nheld on July 24, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three  exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and five\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 3, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nPrior to the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to strike subparagraph\n1.h and  amend subparagraph 2.a to substitute the words security clearance application of February\n21, 2006 for the words public trust application of May 3, 2004, and substitute incorporated\nreferences to subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c through 1.g under Guideline E.  There being no objection\nfrom Applicant, and good cause being demonstrated, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was granted.\nApplicant did not indicate any intention to change his responses based on the Government\u2019s\namendments.\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to afford\nhim the opportunity to check on the status of the deficiency debts covered by subparagraphs 1.f and\n1.g., which arose out of a home foreclosure.  For good cause shown, Applicant was afforded 30 days\nto check on his debts and supplement the record if he wished to.  The Government was granted seven\ndays to respond.  Applicant did not supplement the record.\n\n3\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated seven delinquent debts\nexceeding $25,000.00 and to have completed a personal financial statement indicating a net monthly\nremainder of $896.00.  Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his February 2006\nsecurity clearance application (as amended) by omitting his delinquent debts listed in subparagraphs\n1.a and 1.c through 1.g (as amended).\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covering his\ndelinquent debts, but denied falsifying his security clearance application.  Applicant did not provide\nany explanations for his responses.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 49-year-old civilian who provides storage services for a defense contractor and\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts (seven altogether) after he lost his job\nin 2001 while living in State 1.  Out of work for almost a year, he couldn\u2019t continue paying on a\nnumber of his debts, including his split mortgage loan that he used to finance his home purchase in\nAugust 2000 (R.T., at 41-46, 64-68).  Creditor 1.f and creditor 1.g loaned Applicant the money to\nbuy his home in State 1 on the basis of an 80-20 split between the two lenders (R.T., at 66-68).\nTogether, they loaned Applicant approximately $100,000.00, secured by Applicant\u2019s home, with\ncreditor 1.f taking an 80 per cent position in the loan, and creditor 1.g taking the remaining 20 per\ncent (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 66-68).  How the respective loan positions of creditors 1.f and 1.g\nwere covered in the mortgage instruments covering the loan is neither documented nor clarified by\nApplicant.  \nWhen Applicant could no longer make his mortgage payments on his house (following his\njob loss in 2001), one of his mortgagees (or both) notified Applicant (in September 2001) of its \nintention to foreclose.  Creditor 1.f (the lender with the largest loan position) proceeded to foreclose\non Applicant\u2019s State 1 home in September 2002 (R.T., at 69).  Whether creditor 1.g participated in\nthe foreclosure or not is not clear.  Following the public sale of the property for less than the amount\nthen owed on the split mortgage, both creditors, however, claimed deficiencies (based on a perceived\n80-20 split on the total mortgage debt).  Applicant believes the creditors used non-judicial\nprocedures to foreclose on his home, but he couldn\u2019t be sure (R.T., at 70-74).  Afforded an\nopportunity to check on the procedures and validate whether creditors1.f and 1.g were entitled to\ndeficiencies under the foreclosure procedures they utilized in State 1, Applicant failed to provide any\npost-hearing documentation.  \nWhether or not creditors 1.f and 1.g have legally sustainable debts at this time remains\nunclear.  Without the loan origination and debt instruments to peruse, it is factually impossible to\nknow whether the debts qualify as first and purchase money mortgages, or whether one of the debts\nwas secured by a second mortgage on Applicant\u2019s State 1 home.  Depending on the type of mortgage\ninstrument the underlying debts attached to, the legal consequences of a non-judicial foreclosure\n\n4\ncould be considerable.  Ensuing actions taken by Applicant and the creditors to affirm these debts,\nin turn, could effect the enforcement of these debts under the statutes of limitations in force in either\nor both of the states he has resided in.\nHaving admitted the creditor 1.f and 1.g debts in his answer without any explanations,\nApplicant assumed a heavy proof burden to nullify their status as valid, subsisting debts.  While his\ncreditor 1.f debt has since been removed from his credit report (see ex. A), the reasons for the\ndeletion of this debt are not provided in the credit report.  Whether the debt\u2019s removal from\nApplicant\u2019s credit report was the result of a reporting decision that the creditor 1.f debt was not a\nvalid debt, or was simply no longer enforceable due to the running of an applicable State 1 or State\n2 statute of limitation, is at this point unknown.  Without any more in the record to discern the nature\nand status of these creditor 1.f and 1.g debts, they must be treated as likely valid and enforceable\ndebts for purposes of these evidentiary proceedings. \nAfter losing his home and finding no work in State 1, Applicant and his wife moved to State\n2 in 2002.  Once relocated in State 2, he was able to find work.  He held jobs with two different\nemployers before joining his current employer in 2006 (R.T., at 50).  Applicant\u2019s wife lost her own\njob, however, in July 2006 (R.T., at 33).  Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts\n(seven altogether) after she lost her job and couldn\u2019t continue to help in paying their marital debts.\nTo date, he has made not contact with these creditors (R.T., at 41-47).  \nIn December 2006, his wife\u2019s son, daughter and granddaughter from another marriage came\nto reside with him. This produced still additional financial burdens on Applicant who was\nresponsible for caring for his family on just his personal income.  With his disposable income further\nreduced, Applicant has made no attempt to contact most of his listed creditors (R.T., at 41-43).\nThese creditors include creditors 1.a through 1.c  and creditor 1.e.  Each of these debts is small and\nin the aggregate do not exceed $600.00. Applicant acknowledges the creditor 1.d debt and has taken\nsteps to discharge this debt.\nIn March 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s daughter and granddaughter moved out of his home in\nState 2 and to a place of their own in State 1 (R.T., at 33).   Not long after their move (in April 2007),\nApplicant became ill and requested a three-week leave of absence to address issues related to his\nsecurity clearance, marital status, physical and mental health, and job performance (see ex. C).  Two\nweeks later, he voluntarily admitted himself to a hospital for treatment of a stress-related illness (see\nex. D; R.T., at 27, 33).  After a short release from the hospital, he was hospitalized again one month\nlater for a stress-related ulcer (R.T., at 2, 33).  After a brief hospital stay, he returned to work the\nsame month.  While his hospitalizations were mostly covered by his health insurance, he remains\nresponsible for subscriber cost-shares (see ex. A), which could exceed $1,500.00.\nApplicant\u2019s wife found employment in July 2007, which Applicant believes will help him\nto address his delinquent debts (R.T., at 34).  He is able to document paying on only one of the listed\ncreditors.  Pursuant to a payment arrangement he completed with the creditor (creditor 1.d) he has\nmade three payments (ranging from $50.00 to $150.00) and has reduced the principal balance from\n$1,637.00 to around $1,300.00 with this creditor (see ex. B; R.T., at 22-26, 44-46).  \nApplicant currently takes home approximately $500.00 a week from his work (R.T., at 51-\n52).  Between his wife and himself, he estimates to have a net monthly remainder that ranges\n\n5\nbetween $60.00 and $200.00 (R.T., at 59).  With his mounting medical debts (not covered in the\nSOR) that could exceed $1,500.00 (R.T., at 58), and with such a small remainder to work with, he\nhas not been able to make any headway with his remaining creditors, including the two largest\ncreditors (creditors 1.f and 1.g) that hold deficiency claims that survived Applicant\u2019s 2002\nforeclosure.\nAsked to complete a security clearance application (e-Qip) in June 2006, Applicant answered\nno to question 28 which inquired about his having any debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively.  Applicant assures he did not know about any delinquent debts when he completed the\ne-Qip (R.T., at 62-64).  At the time, he was aware he had stopped paying on his creditor 1.d Visa\naccount, and he was certainly aware of the foreclosure on his house in 2002.  Applicant never\nreceived any deficiency notices from either of the foreclosing creditors until just recently (R.T., at\n62).  He remains confused over whether either creditor was legally entitled to deficiencies under the\nnon-judicial foreclosure procedures they reportedly utilized (R.T., at 68-75).  While aware of his\ndelinquent Visa account, he states he just did not think about this creditor when he completed the\napplication (R.T., at 62-64).\nWithout any more information available on the source of Applicant\u2019s two largest debts (i.e.,\nhis deficiency debts resulting from his split creditor 1.f and 1.g home loans that ended in foreclosure)\nand information available to him about the other debts attributable to him, his claims of confusion\nover whether he owed either of these creditors any deficiencies are difficult to corroborate.  Afforded\nan opportunity to acknowledge his 2002 foreclosure (less than seven years removed from his\ncompleted SF-86), he answered in the negative to question 27 (a) and (b) of his June 2006 e-Qip.\nThis omission involved a foreclosure he was clearly aware of and affects credibility assessments on\nhis question 28 omissions as well.  Still, enough uncertainty remains over the legality of any\ndeficiency claims from creditors 1.f and 1.g to negate any inferences of knowing and wilful omission\nof these claims in his question 27 response. \nApplicant\u2019s overall credibility is sufficient also to entitle him to the benefit of the doubt on\nhis denials of any knowledge about delinquency balances with creditors 1.a through 1.c and 1.e,  his\ninadvertent failure to recall his delinquent creditor 1.d Visa debt, and his creditor 1.f and 1.g\nomissions.  Favorable inferences warrant that Applicant did not knowingly and wilfully falsify his\nJune 2006 e-Qip. \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n6\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n7\nApplicant is a storage service provider for a defense contractor who accumulated a number\nof delinquent debts while residing in States 1 and 2 over a five-year period spanning 2001 and 2006.\nWhen completing his e-Qip in February 2006, he omitted all of his delinquent debts when\nanswering question 28 about debts over 180 days and 90 days delinquent, respectively. \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the Regulation\nwhere the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his\nfailure to document payments on most of them (including his two largest debts) warrant the\napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC 19\u00a9) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations).\nTo be sure, Applicant has experienced a number of financial setbacks due to his loss of\nemployment in State 1 and his wife\u2019s layoff in State 2.  His home foreclosures in State 1 are directly\nlinked to his employment lay off and ensuing income deficits that prevented him from keeping up\nwith his mortgage payments.  His recent hospitalization promises, too, to have some adverse impact\non his repayment efforts.   Medical bills covering these hospital admissions are considerable and\ninclude some subscriber responsibility.  These bills are not covered by the SOR and have not yet\nreached delinquent status according to Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s accrued debts, as such, merit extenuation credit by virtue of his employment\ncircumstances (both his own job losses and his wife\u2019s) and his more recent health complications.\nMC 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) of the\nmitigating conditions (MC) of the guidelines for financial considerations has application to\nApplicant\u2019s circumstances.\nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has made some effort to address his delinquent debts\nand documents his repayment arrangement with creditor 1.d and his three payments made to the\ncreditor in accordance with a payment arrangement.  However, he has failed to provide any follow-\nup payment documentation with any of his other creditors or reasons for disputing the claimed\ndeficiencies with his two foreclosing creditors (creditors 1.f and 1.g).  Based on his very limited\nrepayment efforts to date, and his absence of financial counseling, he may take little advantage of\nany of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the financial considerations guideline.  MC 20\u00a9) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control) has no application; while MC 20(d) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) has\nonly limited application.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Financial\n\n8\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and\nconfidence in the holder of the clearance.\nDocumentation covering his loan packages with creditors 1.f 1.g and the foreclosure\nmeasures they reportedly utilized to reclaim their security in Applicant\u2019s home conceivably could\nconfirm the absence of any deficiency owed to either of the creditors.  Without any prior statements\nor documentation from Applicant to establish (a) the nature of his mortgage secured loan\nobligations with creditors 1.f and 1.g and (b) the procedures the creditors used to recover their loan\nsecurity and repay their loans, the evidentiary burden fell to Applicant to recreate the loan and\nrecovery process utilized by each secured creditor.  This Applicant has failed to do with the\nadditional time afforded him.  All that is known about his creditor 1.f and 1.g loans is his\ncharacterization of the loans as an 80-20 mortgage loan allocated between the two creditors and\ntheir likely use of non-judicial foreclosure procedures in State 1 to foreclose their loans. \nWhether or not Applicant\u2019s home produced enough sale proceeds at any scheduled\nforeclosure sale is unclear.  Under their respective statutory regimes, both State 1 and State 2 do\nprovide for an action to recover a deficiency for any foreclosed security (by either judicial or non-\njudicial sale procedures) that does not cover the loan balance at the time of the sale.  Compare\n\u00a751.002 of T Property Code (2007) with \u00a733-814 of A.R.S. (2007).   Both deficiency statutes are\ntime sensitive, however, and require independent legal actions by the claiming creditor within\nspecified periods of time.  There is no evidence that either creditor has initiated any legal action to\nrecover a claimed deficiency in either State 1 or State 2 to date.  Still, without any documentation\nfrom Applicant, it is still not feasible to piece together all of the events associated with his State 1\nforeclosure.  Having admitted to owing monies to creditors 1.f and 1.g, it became incumbent on\nApplicant to provide the relevant background information on these two major debts listed in his\nprior creditor reports to facilitate firm assessments of the validity and enforceability of these listed\ndebts.\nWhile Applicant is credited with taking some restorative efforts with his finances through\nan initiated repayment arrangement with creditor 1.d,  his failure to document any further payments\nof his delinquent debts and/or furnish sound legal reasons for disclaiming any deficiency\nresponsibilities with creditors 1.f and 1.g are puzzling.  While one or both of these latter creditors\nmay not be entitled to a deficiency, each could have a valid claim depending its individual\ncircumstances.  Creditor 1.f\u2019s removal from Applicant\u2019s latest credit report could mean that the\nreporting agency determined that the reported debt had no merit.  It could also signify no more than\nthat the agency removed the debt because of a discovered statute of limitations enforcement bar in\none or both of the relevant states of Applicant residence.\nLegal problems associated with the creditor 1.f and 1.g debts are twofold.  The first problem\nconcerns debt validity; while the second involves the separate issue of enforceability.   Were either\ndebt to have been secured by a second mortgage instrument, the holder of the second mortgage in\na default situation would have been faced with the decision of either foreclosing itself to protect its\nsecurity, bidding up the sale price to protect its second position, or relinquishing its security\naltogether to the foreclosing first mortgage holder and retaining its entitlement as a sold-out junior\nlien holder to pursue a deficiency against the borrower.  Based only on the information contained\nin Applicant\u2019s credit reports, the nature of the mortgage instruments held by creditors 1.f and 1.g\ncannot be clearly determined.   Applicant provides no documentation and leaves to doubt the\n\n9\nvalidity of these two debts arising out of his foreclosure. His admissions standing alone raise at least\nsome possibility of the validity of these two debts and preclude uncorroborated Applicant denials\nof these debts ab initio.\nEnforceability of the creditor 1.f and 1.g debts (the second problem) raises a potential\ncollection bar.  This potential defense was never pursued by Applicant and for different reasons\ndoes not appear to be available to negate the legal force of these subsisting debts.  First of all, it is\nless than clear whose statute of limitations would apply in a hypothetical case situation: State 1's\n(where the debt arose) or State 2 (where Applicant has resided since 2002). \nWere State 1's statute of limitations to apply to these 2002 debts, both debts conceivably\ncould have expired in 2006 based on State 1's 4-year statute of limitations for both claims on a\nwritten contract (see 16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code) and claims not otherwise\nprovided for (see 16.051 of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code).  State 2, by contrast, has a 6-year\nstatute of limitations on debts arising out of a written contract, but just 90 days for a creditor to\ninstitute an action based on a deficiency following a foreclosure sale (see \u00a7 33-814 (A.R.S. 2007).\nApplication of the latter time requirement would appear to depend on whether the particular creditor\nactually benefitted from the sale of the underlying security.  By implication, this much shorter 90-\nday limitations bar would appear to have no application to a sold-out junior lienor.  \nSo, depending on what security (if any) the creditor 1.f and 1.g creditors elected to avail\nthemselves of, what deficiencies each may have incurred, which state\u2019s statute of limitations were\nto be applied, and whether Applicant ever took any actions to publicly reaffirm the creditor 1.f and\n1g debts as validly subsisting ones, the debts could hypothetically be considered binding\nenforceable debts, or legally expired ones.  None of these issues can be sorted out in this record\nwithout considerable briefing and loan documentation from Applicant. \nMoreover, potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by our\nAppeal Board to absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.  While statutes\nof limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging plaintiffs from\npursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, they have never been equated with good-\nfaith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April\n2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and minimal documented steps he has taken to resolve most of them under both a\nguideline analysis and a whole person assessment, Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns\nrelated to his longstanding debt delinquencies.  Unfavorable conclusions are drawn with respect to\nthe allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c and 1.e through 1.g of the financial\nconsideration guideline.  Applicant warrants favorable conclusions with respect to subparagraph\n1.d. \nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Applicant\u2019s clearance application\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under\nthe personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of his omissions of his debts in the e-Qip he\ncompleted in February 2006.  By omitting debts attributable to him over 180 and 90 days\n\n10\ndelinquent, respectively, Applicant failed to furnish materially important background information\nabout his debts that was needed for the Government to properly process and evaluate his security\nclearance application. \nApplicant\u2019s e-Qip omissions are attributable to his confusion over whether he owed any\nmoney deficiencies to creditors 1.f and 1.g, and to his mistaken belief at the time that he had no\ndebts over 180 and 90 days delinquent with creditors 1.a through 1.e.  Applicant\u2019s impressions at\nthe time, about his non-real estate debts, while potentially mistaken (based on the absence of\nfurnished documentation in the record), were made in good faith, without any indicated intent to\nmislead. Applicant\u2019s explanations, considering the circumstances surrounding the furnished\ninformation at the time, enable him to refute the falsification allegations.  Considering all of the\nevidence produced in this record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the personal\nconduct guideline allegations that Applicant knowingly and wilfully omitted debts more than 180\nand 90 days delinquent, respectively, when completing his June 2006 security clearance application.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 26, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement dated May 21. 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR and admitted all\nof the allegations.

He\n4\nstated if he had any idea that she would allow so many bills to go to collection or foreclosure he\nwould have insisted that he handle the finances.  He further stated he intends to take care of his\n5\nfinances and open an account with a credit counseling service to work out a repayment plan, however\nhe is waiting until the debts have been divided.  \n6\nApplicant acknowledged on his security clearance application, that he completed in March\n2005, that he had a car loan account that was delinquent and stated: \u201cThis is an old account and I do\nnot even know the current status.\u201d  Regarding another car loan debt that he listed he stated: \u201cTo my\n7\nknowledge, this car has been repossessed.\u201d  Applicant was aware he had at least two delinquent\n8\ndebts.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n14\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n15\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.16\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less\n17\nthan a preponderance.\u201d  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven\n18\nconduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.19\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas\n20\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n21\non the side of denial.\u201d22\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\n5\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has many debts that are delinquent. One is a judgement\nand the rest are in collection status, charged off, or overdue.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant\u2019s debts are\nrecent and unpaid and he failed to provide any information or tangible evidence that his actions are\nnot likely to recur. The only information provided by Applicant is a statement that he is obtaining\na divorce and when that is completed he will take action. I find FC MC 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has been separated from his wife since January 2001, a period of more than six\nyears. He presumably failed to minimally monitor his financial situation. He alluded to being\nunaware that his wife let their debts go to collection and foreclosure.  However, he listed two car\ndebts in his security clearance application in 2005. On one he stated it was an old account and the\nother he admitted it was repossessed. He failed to explain why he had not taken any action on the\ndebts that he was fully aware of. He provided no other information other than his regret that he let\nhis wife handle the finances while they were separated. Under these circumstances I find Applicant\ndid not act responsibly and FC MC 20(b) does not apply.\nApplicant did not provide any information that he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay\nhis creditors, nor that he has received any financial counseling. The lack of information on any good-\nfaith effort to repay or take action on the debts casts doubt on his reliability and good judgment. I\nfind FC MC 20(c) and (d) do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n6\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on\nfinancial considerations. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.-1.j\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

As required by Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) on November 6, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision: security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (financial considerations) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of\nDefense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June\n15, 2007, by admitting to all 25 allegations raised. Applicant again admitted to all 25\nallegations on August 21, 2007, in an amended response which included his request for\n\u201ca decision without a hearing.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) on\nSeptember 25, 2007. Applicant was instructed to file any objections to the information in\nthe FORM within 30 days of receipt of that package. Applicant received the FORM on\nOctober 4, 2007. No information was submitted in response to the FORM within the 30\nday period provided. The case was forwarded by the Director, DOHA, on February 21,\n2008, for assignment of the case. I was assigned the case that same day. \nFebruary 27,2008\n\n SOR \u00b6 1.a.\n1\n SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e.\n2\nSOR \u00b6 1.s and \u00b6\u00b6 1.v through 1.x.\n3\n SOR \u00b6 1.r, \u00b6 1.t, and \u00b6 1.u.\n4\n The labrum is the cartilage ring surrounding the shoulder socket.\n5\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s response to the 25 allegations raised is limited to his 25 admissions.\nConsequently, there are scant available facts as to his life, his financial history, and his\ncurrent fiscal situation. He is a 42-year-old machinist who has worked for the same\nfederal contractor since February 2005. He is married and the father of six children,\nranging in age from 25 to 5 years. He also has three grown stepchildren. Applicant\nreceived approximately three years of training at a regional education center. \nOn September 8, 2000, Applicant filed a voluntary Chapter 7 petition for\nbankruptcy.  His total listed liabilities were approximately $28,433 and his total listed\n1\nassets were approximately $1,653. Those debts subject to the bankruptcy proceeding\nwere discharged on December 29, 2000. \nOn or about September 2000, a judgment was entered against Applicant in the\namount of $85. On or about May 2002, another judgment was entered against\nApplicant in the amount of $359, and a debt to a state utilities entity was placed in\ncollection in 2002 for the approximate amount of $257. On or about August 2003, a\nthird judgment was entered against Applicant in the approximate amount of $1,434. As\nof January 3, 2007, these obligations remained unpaid.  \n2\nAlso outstanding as of January 3, 2007, are debts for two collection accounts in\nthe approximate amounts of $49 and $461, respectively, a child support arrearage of\napproximately $4,170 and a debt to a state employment commission that was charged\noff in the approximate amount of $2,566.  Three medical accounts were referred for\n3\ncollection between June 2004 and June 2005. These collection efforts concerned\napproximate amounts of $302, $75, and $304, and were similarly outstanding as of\nJanuary 3, 2007.  \n4\nOn or about September 2, 2005, Applicant suffered an accident while working,\ninjuring his left shoulder, knee, and wrist. Between that date and February 22, 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s condition has been medically addressed approximately 27 times, including\nthree surgeries, multiple MRIs, and control of several localized infections requiring\nantibiotics and additional care; related pain was pharmaceutically managed. His\ndiagnosis as of March 2007 was \u201cLeft RTC SLAP tear,\u201d indicating rotator cuff and\nlabrum  tears, and \u201cLeft knee, torn meniscus.\u201d Also noted was continued knee\n5\n\n See Item 6 (Applicant\u2019s Response to DOHA Interrogatory, dated March 9, 2007) at 16-18 (marked as pages\n6\n48-50).\n Item 6, supra, at 4 (marked as page 36).\n7\n Id.\n8\n Id. at 5 (marked as page 37).\n9\n SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.q.\n10\n Item 6, supra, at 6-9 (marked as pages 38-41).\n11\nDepartment of the Navy v.

No lifting with left arm.\u201d \nIn response to DOHA inquiry as to his current financial obligations Applicant\nwrote the following: \u201cI was injured back in Sept. of \u201805. Since then I have managed to\npay my most important bills first which was child support and back taxes. My\nemployment allowed me to start catching up on past bills until these three surgeries\nwithin the last year are better [sic] that have had a large impact on my income.\u201d  As to\n7\nhis efforts toward his finances, he wrote: \u201cDoing the best I can with what I have until\nable to return to work. Also I am not able to pay off full amount of my monthly child\nsupport. Also can\u2019t afford to pay on bill[s] until returning to work.\u201d  In response to an\n8\ninquiry regarding his past chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant stated: \u201cMy debts out\nweighed my income after my divorce and I wanted a fresh start.\u201d9\nBetween Applicant\u2019s September 2005 injury and the issuance of the May 2007\nSOR, 12 medical accounts were referred for collection, amounting to approximately\n$2,237.  While still restricted to light duty, Applicant completed a Personal Financial\n10\nStatement, DSS Form 154, on March 9, 2007.  It showed Applicant\u2019s monthly\n11\nexpenses and payments to equal his net monthly income without accounting for any\npayments on his delinquent debts. The monthly income shown was $1,240 acquired as\n\u201dwork comp/short term disability.\u201d Nothing else is known of his current financial situation\nor current physical condition.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the\n12\nPresident has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a\n\nId. at 527.\n13\nExec.

The decision to deny an\n17\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an\napplicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines\n18\nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.19\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the\nDirective. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and\nsurrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age\nof the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5)\nthe absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances\nor conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\n\n5\nGuideline F- Financial Considerations: Finances are a concern because failure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well\nas those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline\nare set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nConclusions\nI have carefully considered all the appropriate legal standards and facts in\nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions to all the allegations raised in the SOR. I\nhave also considered the foregoing in light of the applicable guideline, including both\nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions available under that guideline.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts that he failed to pay. He admits he owes\nthe cumulative debt and it remains delinquent. Based on such evidence, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19 (a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nConsequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate financial considerations security\nconcerns.\nApplicant\u2019s 2000 chapter 7 bankruptcy put him on fresh financial footing after his\ndivorce from his first wife. Judgments and obligations adding up to several thousand\ndollars, however, were acquired between that time and his 2005 accident. Since the\naccident, the financial chasm between financial stability and his current debt problems\nhas grown, amounting to over $13,500 in delinquent obligations. Although he is\ncommitted to meeting his child support obligations and back taxes, the recent and\nunbridled growth of additional debt does not give rise to Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nWith the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.w (child support arrearage), Applicant has not\nreferenced any attempt to address the obligations noted in the SOR. Nor has Applicant\nnoted whether he has sought and received financial counseling to help him address his\ndebts and manage his finances in the future. Consequently, neither FC MC 20 (d) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) nor FC MC 20 (c) (the person received or is receiving counseling for the problem\n\n6\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies.\nApplicant\u2019s September 2005 accident resulted in debilitating and painful injuries\nto his shoulder, wrist, and knee. Such injuries highly limited his mobility, required\nmultiple surgeries, and necessitated a protracted recuperation period. Although his\ncurrent health and ability is unknown because he chose to have a determination on the\nrecord and because he declined to respond to the September 2007 FORM, such\nsituations generally trigger the application of FC MC 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nIn this situation, however, Applicant\u2019s medical bills and his interim inability to\nmake payments on his debts are but small parts of a bigger picture. No facts were\npresented as to any efforts exerted to address the non-child support related obligations\nincurred before his September 2005 accident and at issue in the SOR. Because no\nevidence was offered as to what his former earned income was or projected earned\nincome might be, it cannot be determined whether his return to work and a regular\nincome will be an increase or decrease from the level of disability compensation income\ndemonstrated. He similarly failed to posit or project a strategy for addressing his debts,\ncommit to financial counseling, or otherwise address ameliorative plans regarding his\nfinances after he returns to full health and vigor as well as full-time employment.\nAlthough the accident may mitigate him from some of his obligations during his period\nof recuperation, it does not absolve him from either nominally addressing his debts or,\nat least, demonstrating a calculated plan to address them in a responsible, determined\nmanner in the future. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount\nconcern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded,\ncommonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that\nthe person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a\ncareful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It\nrecognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nBased on the scant facts in the record, I considered the whole person in\nevaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, and profession. I also\nconsidered his financial situation over the past eight years, his income, and his debts,\nand his attempts to address his obligation. In light of these considerations, I have also\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s 2005 injury, medical needs, physical limitations, and general\nrecuperation; it is acknowledged that his injury is the sort that would be particularly\ndebilitating to a machinist. Applicant was debt free after his 2000 bankruptcy. By the\n\n7\ntime he was injured in September 2005, he had already acquired new delinquent debt.\nThere is no indication he addressed any of the accounts noted in the SOR before his\ninjury, nor is there evidence he has since address that debt. There is no indication that\nhe ever conceived a plan or received financial counseling to address those debts,\nbefore or after his accident. Consequently, his injury cannot be cited as the cause of his\ninability to pay the vast majority of his delinquent debt.\nAlthough his final submissions were dated around the time he was returning to\nwork, Applicant presented little more than admissions to the SOR allegations and an\nexplanation as to his injury. Without some indication as to how a return to salary might\nhelp ameliorate his financial situation, and absent some projection regarding a workable\nrepayment plan to address his debts, there is no indication Applicant has considered\nwhen, or if, he might meet these obligations in the future. \nApplicant admitted all 25 financial allegations and failed to mitigate the financial\nsecurity concerns to which those allegations gave rise. Any reasonable doubt about\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information. Based on the little information\nprovided, Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns. Therefore, based on the totality\nof the evidence in this case, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F is against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She is a 31-year-old security officer employed by a defense contractor since July 2005. She has not previously held a clearance. When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in September 2005 (Item 1), she deliberately concealed her criminal record and drug use between October 1994 and November 2002 by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions 23a. (ever charged with or convicted of any felony), 23b (ever charged with or convicted of any drug offense), and 24 (illegal drug use, last seven years). In fact, she used marijuana and cocaine recreationally from 2001 to May 2003. In addition, she had been charged with felony robbery in October 1994 and felony narcotics possession in November 2002. She pled guilty to both charges. On the robbery charge, she was convicted of felony accessory, and the disposition of the case tends to confirm her claim that she was the unwitting driver when two of her friends robbed a store they had stopped at.

Le\u2019i, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 3 August 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nJ, H, and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 19 September 2007, and requested a\n1\ndecision without hearing. On 17 November 2007, she responded to DOHA\u2019s 25 October\n2007 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 18 December 2007, when\nDepartment Counsel indicated no objection to the response. DOHA assigned the case\nto me 15 January 2008.\nJanuary 31,2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate her\nadmissions as findings of fact. She is a 31-year-old security officer employed by a\ndefense contractor since July 2005. She has not previously held a clearance.\nWhen Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in September 2005 (Item 1),\nshe deliberately concealed her criminal record and drug use between October 1994 and\nNovember 2002 by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions 23a. (ever charged with or convicted of\nany felony), 23b (ever charged with or convicted of any drug offense), and 24 (illegal\ndrug use, last seven years). In fact, she used marijuana and cocaine recreationally from\n2001 to May 2003. In addition, she had been charged with felony robbery in October\n1994 and felony narcotics possession in November 2002. She pled guilty to both\ncharges.\nOn the robbery charge, she was convicted of felony accessory, and the\ndisposition of the case tends to confirm her claim that she was the unwitting driver when\ntwo of her friends robbed a store they had stopped at. She served 49 days in jail, and\nreceived three years probation. In February 1998 her probation was terminated, and the\ncharge reduced to misdemeanor accessory and dismissed. On the narcotics charge,\nshe received 18 months probation before judgment on condition, among others, that\nshe complete a one-year residential drug treatment program. She attended such a\nprogram between May 2003 and October 2004. In January 2005, she failed to appear in\ncourt as required to provide proof of her program completion, and a bench warrant was\nissued for her arrest. The ensuing legal issues were eventually resolved, and the charge\nagainst her was dismissed in June 2005. In June 2006, Applicant was interviewed\nduring the course of her background investigation, and denied to the investigator that\nshe had ever used illegal drugs.\nApplicant has offered inconsistent and implausible explanations for her failure to\ndisclose her criminal and drug abuse records. Despite the clear language of the\nquestions she claims she failed to disclose her arrests because she thought they had\nbeen expunged and would not be discovered. Incredibly, she asserts her successful\ncompletion of the drug treatment program and continued abstinence from drugs as a\nreason for failing to disclose her drug use. Nonsensically, she states that she lied to the\ninvestigator about her drug use because she thought her criminal record had been\nexpunged.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n3\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n\u00b632.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\n4\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b632.(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer\n5\npresent in the person\u2019s life;\n3\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J,  and\n3\nApplicant only partially mitigated the security concerns. The October 1994 accessory\ncharge is mitigated by Applicant\u2019s age (18 at the time), the passage of time (13 years),\nand the circumstances of the offense (her unwitting involvement as driver).  I have also\n4\nconsidered the fact that her unwitting involvement as driver meant that she was\nessentially pressured into being a part of the criminal activity.  However, the same\n5\nmitigating factors do not apply to the November 2002 narcotics offense. Although the\noffense occurred over five years ago, Applicant successfully completed her probation\nrequirements only 2\u00bd years ago, in June 2005, and that result was delayed nearly six\n\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession. . . ;\n6\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances\n7\nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period\n8\nof abstinence;\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\n9\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b616.(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\n10\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative;\n4\nmonths because of Applicant\u2019s bench warrant and subsequent legal issues.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline J against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H,  but\n6\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine and marijuana was\nconfined to a fairly short period of time (2001 to May 2003), was fairly infrequent, and\nended over 4\u00bd years ago.  That abstinence from drug use is adequate to demonstrate\n7\nan intent to refrain from drug use in the future.  I conclude Applicant is unlikely to use\n8\nillegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. She deliberately concealed her illegal\ndrug use and criminal record from the government on her clearance application.  She\n9\nconcealed the most recent of her crimes despite the fact that she had only satisfied the\nrequirements of her probation before judgment four months before she completed the\nclearance application. Her varied explanations for her omissions are implausible, and\nundercut by the fact that she later lied to the investigator about having even used\ndrugs.  Further, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed\n10\ninformation was relevant to a clearance decision. Her disclosure of illegal drug use and\ncriminal conduct was neither prompt nor forthright. Indeed, for practical purposes, it was\nforced from her.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose her criminal record and illegal drug use shows a\nlack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in\nexamining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before\nmaking a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose\nthat adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or\nconvenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nherself provides some indication of her willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests she is willing to put her personal needs ahead of\nlegitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Falsifications\nare a core security concern, as are criminal behavior (RAG &2(a)(1). Her behavior was\ndeliberate and not due to circumstances beyond her control (RAG &2(a)(2); (RAG\n&2(a)(5). Her misconduct was both recent and frequent (RAG &2(a)(3). Applicant was\n26 when she was arrested on the drug charge, nearly 29 when she falsified her\nclearance application, and over 29 when she lied to the investigator (RAG &2(a)(4).)\nApplicant\u2019s implausible explanations for her falsifications belie any claim to rehabilitation\nor behavioral changes (RAG & 2(a)(6).) She clearly sought to mislead the government\nabout her criminal and drug record (RAG &2(a)(7). Applicant\u2019s willingness to put her\npersonal needs ahead of legitimate government interests increases her potential\nvulnerability and she has not demonstrated that the misconduct is unlikely to recur\n(RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9). Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt\nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal\nconduct and falsifications.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nThomas D. Leland, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s long history of alcohol abuse that includes two DUI\u2019s,  has not been mitigated\nby sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 21, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to another Administrative\nJudge on April 23, 2007.  The case was reassigned to the undersigned Administrative Judge on June\n14, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 4, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 19, 2007.\nAt the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented twelve exhibits and\ntestified on her own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 31 years old, single, and is currently working on her Masters Degree in\nbusiness.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Engineer, and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because she abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant admitted to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\nThe Applicant was arrested on May 18, 2001, and charged with (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence and (2) Driving While Having a Measurable Blood Alcohol.  She explained that she went\nout after work with her girlfriends and had several cocktails before getting behind the wheel.  She\nwas pulled over for speeding and it was determined that she was also under the influence of alcohol.\nIt was determined that the Applicant had a blood alcohol level of .12 percent at the time of the arrest.\nShe pled guilty to Reckless Driving.  She was  sentenced to a first time offenders program that\nincluded  required attendance at Alcohol Anonymous meetings and she was fined.  Her driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended for six months and she was placed on probation for three years.\nFrom May 2001 until October 2005, the Applicant was not arrested nor confronted by law\nenforcement for any reason.\nOn October 28, 2005, the Applicant was charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of\n\n3\nAlcohol, (2) Driving with a Measurable Blood-Alcohol Concentration of .08 percent or more, (3)\nDriving on a Suspended License, and (4) Driving with No Proof of Insurance or Liability.  She\nexplained that again it was a Friday after work and she had met some friends for cocktails at a bar.\nShe left the bar and rear-ended another car.  No one was injured as a result of the accident.  She pled\nguilty to Count (1) and were sentenced to a Multiple Offender Program, that included 64 hours of\nvolunteer work, attendance at two Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, her drivers license was\nsuspended and she was placed on probation for five years and fined $1,750.00.  She plans to get her\ndriver\u2019s license back in April 2008, and remains on probation until at least 2010.\nThe Applicant indicates that she is in compliance with the sentencing requirements however,\nshe has only completed  27 hours of the required 64 hours that is needed to complete her community\nservice.  Since the Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license has been revoked she must rely on friends, cabs and\nbuses for transportation.\nThe Applicant\u2019s program manager testified that the Applicant is not afraid of hard work.  She\nhas initiative and works well with others.  (Tr. p. 66).  He has no reservations about her having\naccess to sensitive information.  (Tr. p. 71).   \nA friend and business school classmate of the Applicant\u2019s also testified and indicated that\nhe has never known the Applicant to drink to the point of intoxication but he has gone out with her\nfor cocktails in the past.  He has never observed her driving after consuming alcohol.  (Tr. p. 77-78)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because she engaged in questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about her ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe Applicant admitted to the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  \nOn May 31, 2002, the Applicant provided a signed sworn statement to a  Special Agent from\nthe Defense Security Service wherein she stated that she would never drive after drinking any\namount of alcohol from that date forward.  (See Government Exhibit 4).  The Government contends\nthat the Applicant deliberately provided false information to the investigator and that the statement\nwas not true since she continued to drink and drive until at least October 2005.  The Applicant\nexplained that at the time she made the statement her true intent was to never drink and drive again\nand she fully intended to comply with that,  but was simply unable to.    \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n\n4\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . ;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.  (b) Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to\nan employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\ngovernment representative.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in alcohol abuse or personal\nconduct that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G) and poor personal conduct (Guideline E).  This evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because\nof the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with\nher security clearance eligibility.\n\n6\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under\nGuidelines G and E of the SOR.\nThe Applicant\u2019s recent and extensive history of alcohol abuse as evidenced by her two DUI\u2019s\nin 2001 and 2005, demonstrates that her exercise of poor judgment is not an aberration, but has\nbecome a basic part of the Applicant\u2019s character during her recent adult life.  Her most recent DUI\noccurred just two years ago.  At the present time, she has not yet completed her required community\nservice and she remains on probation until at least 2010.  She no longer drinks and drives because\nher drivers license has been revoked.  Although there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol\ndependence, the Applicant acknowledges that drink has caused her many problems, but she continues\nto consume alcohol.  There is no evidence in the record to indicate that she has been able to remain\nalcohol free for any extended period of time. \nI have carefully considered the favorable words from her professional colleagues, her\nfavorable performance reviews, and commendable graduate school grades, but that evidence does\nnot come close to mitigating the negative effect of her two very serious alcohol related arrests. \nUnder Alcohol Consumption, Disqualifying Conditions 22 (a) alcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving under the influence . . . ; and 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgement, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Accordingly\nGuideline G is found against the Applicant. \nUnder Personal Conduct, there is no evidence in the record that indicates that the Applicant\ndeliberately provided false information to the Government when she told the investigator that she\nhad no intention of ever drinking and driving again.  At the time she made the statement, her intent\nwas to never drink and drive again.  As she explained, it was her good intention at the time, but she\nwas unable to follow her desires.  Upon that assumption, I do not find that she provided false\ninformation to the investigator at the time she made the statement.  Accordingly, Guideline E is\nfound for the Applicant. \nOn balance, however, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence\nsupports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 of the SOR.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n\n8\n",

Accordingly, she made the decision to stay home and watch their children starting\nin 1999.  The Applicant began working for a Defense contractor in 2006 and, that same year, began\nworking with his mother-in-law, a bookkeeper, on a financial plan.  One debt has been paid.  He is\nworking with a consumer credit counseling service to pay his two remaining past due debts.\nApplicant is eligible for a security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on an unknown date and on May 14, 2007,\nand requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on August 13, 2007, and a\nNotice of Hearing was issued on August 17, 2007.\nA hearing was held on August 30, 2007, at which the Government presented five\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called two additional\nwitnesses, and also submitted seven exhibits.  The transcript was received on September 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 40, married with two children, and has a high school diploma and the\nequivalent of an Associate of Science degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an\nElectronics Technician, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial considerations).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that\nthe Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to obtain funds.\nThe Applicant worked for Company A from 1994 until December 2005.  Company A is not\na Defense contractor.  During this time the Applicant married his wife and they began a family.  The\n\nThe most recent credit report provided by the Government, dated August 30, 2007, states that the\n1\npast due amount is $7,958.00.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 1.)\nThe most recent credit report provided by the Government, dated August 30, 2007, states that the\n2\npast due amount is $8,850.00.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after the birth of his second child in 2001.  His salary was\nstagnating at Company A, and his wife was not working.  The Applicant\u2019s wife made the decision\nto stay home with their children because she did not have the education that would allow her to make\nenough money to afford child care.  (Transcript at 64-66.)  In about 2003 the Applicant and his wife\nbegan using credit cards to pay everyday debts.  By 2004 the debts became overwhelming.\n(Transcript at 37-38.)\nIn 2005, the Applicant\u2019s wife began working with a debt repayment company.  This company\nrecommended that the Applicant allow his debts to become delinquent, then the company would\nmake payment arrangements.  This company has received a great deal of money in fees, but did not\nsuccessfully negotiate payment arrangements with any of their creditors.  (Transcript at 37-39, 49-51;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nBy early 2007, the Applicant realized that he would have to do something about his past due\ndebts.  At that point, he began working with a non-profit consumer credit counseling service.  As\nopposed to the other group, once the Applicant began the program, the service immediately began\npaying his past due debts.  (Transcript at 39-40, 51-53; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nIn order to help make the payments, the Applicant has also begun working part-time for his\nbrother.  The Applicant makes $300.00 to $400.00 a month working for his brother.  (Transcript at\n47-48; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a bookkeeper.  In about September 2006, the Applicant and\nhis wife informed her of their financial problems.  She has put the Applicant and his wife on a\nbudget since that time.  She controls their finances and prepares checks for the Applicant\u2019s signature.\nThey are paying their current debts in a timely manner and are staying within the budget.  (Transcript\nat 74-80; Government Exhibit 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)\nTurning to the specific debts mentioned in the SOR:\n1.a.  The Applicant admits owing a past due Discover Card debt in the original amount of\n$9,154.00.  As of August 25, 2007, this debt had been reduced to $8,517.84.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB at 5.)1\n1.b.  The Applicant admits owing a past due Bank of America debt in the original amount\nof $10,694.00.  As of August 25, 2007, this debt had been reduced to $9,920.53.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B at 5.)2\n1.c.  The Applicant admits owing a past due Chevron debt in the original amount of $286.00.\nThis debt was paid in full as of April 9, 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\n\n4\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant submitted a packet of character reference letters from co-workers, his\nsupervisor, and a Government employee he works with.  He is described as being \u201ccommitted, loyal\nand devoted,\u201d a person with \u201cexcellent work ethics,\u201d and \u201chardworking, diligent and conscientious.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n5\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of financial irresponsibility that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has past due debts, one of which he has paid off, and the other two are being paid off\n(Guideline F).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has had financial difficulties in the past.  Accordingly,\nDisqualifying Conditions 19.a. (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and 19.c. (A history of\nnot meeting financial obligations) apply. \nThe evidence also shows, however, that the Applicant\u2019s inability to pay his debts was in large\npart related to his family and work situation between 1999 and 2005.  In 2006 the Applicant and his\nwife made the undoubtedly difficult personal decision to approach his mother-in-law, a bookkeeper,\nadmit their financial problems, and ask for her professional assistance.  He also made the decision\nto change from a for-profit debt resolution firm that was not working and work with a not-for-profit\nconsumer credit counseling service.  Both of these decisions have resulted in one of the three debts\n\n6\nin the SOR being paid and the other two debts being paid down approximately 10% since April of\nthis year.  He is able to maintain a budget and pay his current indebtedness,\nThe Applicant testified that he intends to resolve the remaining debts as soon as possible.\nThis testimony is credible and worthy of belief.  His credit reports show that he does not abuse\ncredit.  The following Mitigating Conditions apply: 20.a. (The behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment), 20.c. (The person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) and 20.d. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  \nI have also examined this case under the Whole Person concept as described in the General\nFactors, and as set out at length above.  They also support a finding for the Applicant.  Paragraph 1\nis found for the Applicant.  He is eligible for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial problems. Between 2002\nand 2005, he resolved all of his debts through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, except for a $20,000\ntax delinquency not legally dischargable through bankruptcy. He has since paid his tax debts using\nfunds from his retirement savings. His delinquent debts were due, in part, to circumstances beyond\nhis control. His current finances are sound, his circumstances have changed, and he is not likely to\nincur such delinquencies in the future. Clearance is granted.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n In a notarized statement on June 6, 2007, Applicant stated, \u201cI do not wish to have a hearing but if a hearing\n3\nis needed, I will be happy to provide any documentation or answer any questions you may deemed (sic) necessary.\u201d\n Ax. A.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 7, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance needed for his current employment with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.\n1\nOn March 30, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline F\n2\n(financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR. His response was interpreted as a request for a\ndecision without a hearing,  and Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of\n3\nRelevant Materials (FORM). Applicant responded to the FORM on August 12, 2007, and explained\nthat he did not understand the need to affirmatively request a hearing and made clear it was his intent\nall along to have a hearing in this matter.  The case was subsequently assigned to me on October 2,\n4\n2007, and I convened a hearing on November 15, 2007, at which the parties appeared as scheduled.\nWithout objection, I admitted six exhibits offered by the government (Gx. 1 - 6). Applicant testified\nin his own behalf, and offered seven exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits (Ax.) A - G. He also presented two witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nNovember 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant had filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition\non December 2, 2002, and the petition was discharged on December 7, 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that\nhe owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a debt of approximately $20,000, which was not fully\nrepaid as of January 14, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with\nexplanation both allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 44 years old and works as a computer operator for a defense contractor. He has\nheld that job since November 2005. In October 2002, he was hired as a security guard by a different\ndefense contractor and applied for a security clearance in 2003. However, the investigation\n\n Gx. 1.\n5\n Tr., 68.\n6\n Answer; Ax. A.\n7\n Id.\n8\n Tr., 54.\n9\n Tr., 58 - 60.\n10\n3\nunderlying this case is based on a request for clearance sponsored for his computer operator position\nin December 2005.5\nApplicant graduated from college in 1986 with a degree in agriculture business. From\nSeptember 1987 until March 1999, he worked as a nuclear electrician for a U.S. Navy shipyard.\nApplicant and his wife were married in August 1986 and have two teenage children. They separated\nin December 2006 and a divorce is pending.  While Applicant worked at the shipyard, his wife\n6\nworked as a Department of the Navy employee at a Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) command.\nIn 1998, they were told her job would be relocated to another state. Applicant decided to leave his\nshipyard job and move his family to accommodate his wife\u2019s change of location, but he was also told\nhe would be given assistance to find another Navy job at their new residence. Applicant received\nlittle or no help in his job search, and had to take a job paying half what he was making before the\nmove.7\nApplicant and his wife had bought a house at their previous location in 1995. They used a\nloan from his 401k retirement account for the down payment and costs of the purchase. When they\nmoved in 1998, they lost significant income and had to incur the costs of their move. As a result, he\nwas unable to repay the 401k loan and the remainder of those proceeds were declared as income for\nwhich he had to pay taxes for the 1998 and 1999 tax years. He did not have the money to pay those\ntaxes.8\nApplicant\u2019s relocation resulted in extensive costs incurred through the actual move and\nthrough the fact their house did not sell before they moved. At their new location, Applicant and his\nwife were paying their previous mortgage and paying rent, but had only her full time income.  It was\n9\nnot until March 1999 that Applicant found full-time work as an electrician. By that time, Applicant\nand his wife had fallen behind on their bills. In addition to over use of their credit cards, they each\nclaimed the same exemptions from tax withholding to maximize their take home pay. They filed\ntheir tax returns as required each year, but found they owed taxes in addition to what had been\ndeducted from their pay. Their taxes for from tax years 1998 through 2006 went unpaid. Applicant\u2019s\nwife had set up a $200 monthly payroll allotment to pay their back taxes, but it was cancelled by her\nemployer without explanation.10\nIn 1993, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s youngest sister died. They paid for her funeral and helped support\nthe sister\u2019s 11-year-old daughter until she graduated from high school. Additionally, unbeknownst\nto Applicant, around the time they had to relocate, his wife started financially supporting her mother,\n\n Tr., 53 - 54.\n11\n Answer; Ax. A; Ax.

Applicant\u2019s wife paid for her mother\u2019s food, utilities, transportation, and\nmedical bills. She also made a down payment on a new trailer for her mother.11\nOn December 3, 2002, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.\nThrough that action, they entered into a repayment plan whereby they paid $1,252 each month for\nthree years and were able to satisfy all their dischargeable debts. However, their past due taxes could\nnot be discharged through bankruptcy. On completion of the payment plan in 2005, Applicant and\nhis wife owed a tax bill that had grown to about $29,464 with interest and penalties. After an offer\nin compromise was rejected by the IRS in 2006, Applicant withdrew funds from his retirement\nsavings and paid off the debt in March 2007.12\nApplicant did not change the number of his claimed exemptions from withholdings until this\nyear. As a result, he and his wife are each paying half of an $8,000 tax bill from the 2006 tax year.13\nApplicant works 40 hours weekly at his primary job as a computer operator. He also works\nnearly as many hours at his other job as a security guard. He requires a security clearance for both\njobs. His supervisor at the security guard job regards Applicant as a superb worker, who is extremely\nreliable and trustworthy. Several friends and co-workers echoed his supervisor\u2019s opinion of\nApplicant.14\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n15\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n16\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties at\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n17\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n18\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n19\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n20\n \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \n21\n \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\n22\n \u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\n23\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis;\u201d\n5\nhearing require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed in Revised\nAdjudicative Guideline F (financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n17\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n18\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.19\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Consideration. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n20\ngovernment presented sufficient information to support the allegations in the SOR. Available\ninformation shows Applicant still owes about $4,000 in taxes from 2006 after having resolved nearly\n$30,000 in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. He and his wife also resolved their debts through a\nChapter 13 petition, whereby they resolved their dischargeable obligations through a  36-month\nrepayment plan. The record requires consideration of Guideline F disqualifying conditions 19(a),21\n19(c),  and 19(e).\n22\n23\n\n \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\n24\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n  \u201c the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\n25\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\u201d (emphasis added)\n See footnote 16, supra.\n26\n See footnote 15, supra. \n27\n6\nThe record also requires consideration of Guideline F mitigating conditions 20(b)  and\n24\n20(c).  Applicant\u2019s loss of income was due to his wife\u2019s job being relocated. The associated costs\n25\ncould not be controlled, and his wife\u2019s decision to financially support her mother further stressed\ntheir finances. To compound matters, their claimed exemptions left them with taxes they could not\npay, and Applicant\u2019s use of his retirement savings caused further tax liabilities. Although bankruptcy\nis not a desirable means (as opposed to full payment) of resolving one\u2019s debts, Chapter 13 provides\nthe debtor a way of at least partially satisfying his obligations. Applicant and his wife chose this\nroute and repaid more than $45,000 through their petition. Additionally, Applicant used nearly\n$30,000 of his retirement savings to pay outright his tax debts through 2005. He is now paying a\nremaining tax debt of about $4,000, and has adjusted his withholdings so enough taxes will be taken\nfrom his pay up front. \nThe presence or absence of delinquent debts does not end the inquiry into whether one\u2019s\nfinancial problems present an unacceptable security risk. The issue is whether Applicant\u2019s unpaid\ndebts put him at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to pay his debts, or whether his\nfinancial problems reflect adversely on his judgment, reliability, self-control, or willingness to follow\nrules and regulations. Applicant has not tried to evade his responsibility in this matter, and he\ncontinues to work two full-time jobs to ensure he has enough money to resolve his financial\nproblems and support his family. On balance, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns about\nhis finances.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in Section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  Applicant did not invite the facts and circumstances about which the\n26\ngovernment is concerned. Nonetheless, rehabilitation and positive changes in his financial condition\nare evident. He made necessary financial adjustments, took action to repay his debts as soon as he\ncould, and no longer is subject to his wife\u2019s unreasonable use of their income for the benefit of\nothers. He continues to work two jobs to support his family and ensure he has sufficient income to\navoid such problems in the future. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n27\ninformation, particularly the facts bearing on the underlying causes of his financial problems and his\nresponse thereto, shows that the Applicant\u2019s finances do not present an unacceptable risk should he\nbe granted access to classified information.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a and 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nMatthew E. Malone\nAdministrative Judge\n",
