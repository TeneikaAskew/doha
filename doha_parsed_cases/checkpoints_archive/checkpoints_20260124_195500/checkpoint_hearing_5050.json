Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 19, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 27, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n2\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which shows that Applicant has held\na security clearance without incident for approximately 20 years and has now established a plan to\npay off his outstanding debts.  In his brief, Applicant submits new evidence in the form of an\nadditional statement about his continuing efforts to resolve his financial problems.  The Board does\nnot find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive. \nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its\nsubmission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799\nat 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).\nThe absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance\ndecision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security\nimplications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\nsecurity concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine an applicant's\nsecurity eligibility.  A whole person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No.\n03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004). \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had delinquent debts and was still\nin the process of resolving his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\n\n3\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No.\n03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 28, 2006).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn October 31, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr. granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s finding that\nthere was no indication that alcohol abstinence was part of Applicant\u2019s probation was unsupported\nby the record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions\n1  and 6  was arbitrary and capricious; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was arbitrary\n1\n2\nand capricious because it engaged in piecemeal analysis and failed to consider significant record\nevidence.  For the following reasons, the Board reverses the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance\ndecision.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nApplicant was 53 years of age at the time of the hearing.  He began using marijuana at the\nage of 15, following major family crises.  Applicant joined the U.S. Air Force in 1972 and continued\nusing marijuana.  Although Applicant\u2019s drug use was discovered, he was granted a security\nclearance, which was later revoked because of the drug use, and still later restored because he\npromised to refrain from drugs.  Applicant left the Air Force in 1981, but returned in 1983.  Within\na year, he tested positive for drugs and attended a drug program.  Applicant left the Air Force with\na general discharge.  \nApplicant had reduced his marijuana use to about once a month in the late 1990s, but then\nused it to manage nausea during a year of chemotherapy following a diagnosis of Hepatitis C in\n1998.  As a result of the chemotherapy, Applicant underwent psychological treatment which included\ndetoxification from all drugs.  When Applicant returned home after treatment, his wife and son\ncontinued to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana at home.  Applicant began smoking marijuana\nagain, and by 2001 he was using cocaine.\nDue to an altercation between Applicant and his son in September 2001, the police were\ncalled.  The police discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia in Applicant\u2019s apartment.  Applicant was\ncharged with possession of marijuana (a misdemeanor) and cocaine (a felony). Applicant pled guilty\nand was sentenced to 12 months probation for possession of marijuana and six years probation for\npossession of cocaine.  Applicant was also ordered to complete 80 hours of community service and\na drug evaluation or treatment program.  Applicant completed a three-month drug and alcohol\nevaluation program and attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA) at the same time.  He began attending\n\n3\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and continued to do so as of the time of the hearing.  The alcohol\nportion of the program was a choice Applicant made on his own which was unrelated to the drug\ncharges.  Applicant continues to drink beer, but is aware of the effect that alcohol abuse would have\non his health in light of his Hepatitis C.\nOn Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, in response to a question as to whether he had\nabused illegal drugs since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, Applicant\nanswered \u201cno.\u201d  In response to a question as to whether use of alcohol had led him to seek alcohol-\nrelated treatment or counseling in the last seven years, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d The first answer\nwas false, and Applicant testified that he gave a false answer because he was afraid that the truth\nwould affect his job.  At the hearing he demonstrated anguish over his answer and contrition for\nhaving answered the question in the negative.  Concerning the second answer, Applicant indicated\nthat he believed his alcohol treatment and counseling was related to his drug abuse, not to his use\nof alcohol.   \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since shortly before his December 2, 2002 court date.\nHe has become estranged from his wife, son, and others who do not share his drug-free lifestyle.\nApplicant has made other lifestyle changes that have bolstered his efforts to remain drug-free, and\nhe intends to remain that way.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s factual finding that \u201c[t]here is no indication that\nalcohol abstinence was a part of his probation\u201d is unsupported by the record evidence.  While the\nJudge\u2019s statement that there is no indication that there is evidence of an abstinence requirement is\nnot correct, the Board nevertheless will not rule that the Judge was required, on the evidence in this\nrecord, to find that abstinence was a condition of Applicant\u2019s probation.  Clearly, the one finding\nidentified by Department Counsel is factually flawed in that there is some evidence in this record\nthat arguably suggests that abstinence from alcohol was a condition of Applicant\u2019s probation.\nHowever, when reviewing a Judge\u2019s decision, the Board does not consider individual sentences in\nisolation from the rest of the decision; rather, the Board considers the decision in its entirety to\ndiscern what the Judge found and concluded.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-22311 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.\n4, 2003).  The Judge made other findings on the issue in addition to the one cited by Department\nCounsel.    In a footnote that addresses the issue of abstinence, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s hearing\ntestimony and stated, \u201cApplicant is unsure whether alcohol abstinence was part of the court or county\n\nDecision at 4.\n3\n4\nprobation requirements.\u201d   Thus, the Judge acknowledges the presence of ambiguous evidence on\n3\nthe abstinence issue.  The Judge\u2019s finding regarding Applicant\u2019s testimony is sustainable.  There are\nalso aspects of the documentary record that hint at a probation requirement, but fall short of\nestablishing the fact to the point of requiring the Judge to make an affirmative finding regarding it.\nApplicant\u2019s Probation Case Notes (Government Exhibit 4) indicate that Applicant was given an\nalcohol test and that he tested positive.  The notes also contain a report of a narrative from Applicant\nto his caseworker wherein he stated he \u201cwanted a drink bad\u201d and admitted to drinking 6 beers on a\nspecific date.  Applicant also indicated his desire to \u201ctalk to someone\u201d and get into treatment.  The\ncaseworker noted that she was advised to send Applicant to the parole office where someone would\ntalk to him and get him started in treatment.  The only other references to alcohol in the notes\ninvolved the mention of Applicant\u2019s subsequent attendance at AA meetings.  Nowhere in the notes\nis abstinence from alcohol listed as a condition of probation and nowhere in the notes is Applicant\u2019s\nadmitted drinking characterized as a violation of his probation.  Likewise, on a Case Detail Sheet\n(Government Exhibit 3), which describes in some detail the disposition of Applicant\u2019s case,\nincluding terms of probation, abstinence from alcohol is not indicated either as a general or special\ncondition of probation.  Given this record evidence, in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s equivocal\nhearing testimony, the Board rules that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant was not required to abstain\nfrom alcohol as a condition of his probation reflects a reasonable interpretation of the record\nevidence and is sustainable.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Judge concluded that Department Counsel established its case regarding Guideline J, but\nalso concluded that Applicant had mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns by establishing lack\nof recency (Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1) and by establishing clear evidence of\nrehabilitation (Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6).  Department Counsel argues that\napplication of these mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Department\nCounsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is arbitrary and capricious because it\nengages in piecemeal analysis and fails to consider significant record evidence.\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29,43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. We\nreview matters of law de novo.\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition 1 was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have\nmixed merit.\nRegarding Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1, Department Counsel argues that when\nthe Judge applied it, he failed to take the entire adverse record into consideration.  A considerable\nportion of Department Counsel\u2019s argument here is based on the premise that Applicant\u2019s more recent\n\nIn the case below, Department Counsel made no mention of this second apparent falsification, which was\n4\nestablished only in light of Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony.   However, the considerable discrepancy between Applicant\u2019s\nNovember 14, 2005 interrogatory response and his admissions during his hearing testimony became a matter of record\nat that point and was extremely important evidence in light of the other record evidence of falsification.  When reaching\nconclusions concerning mitigation, the Judge cannot simply ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record\nevidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004) (\u201c. . . the Judge\u2019s decision cannot simply be silent about\nwhat, as a matter of common sense, appears to be a relevant factor that could be an important aspect of the case\u2019).  \n5\nalcohol consumption was a violation of probation.  Inasmuch as the Judge did not find that\nApplicant\u2019s drinking was a violation of probation and the Board has found that finding sustainable,\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument is, to a degree, undercut.  However, Department Counsel also\nargues that in applying the mitigating condition, the Judge evaluated only the recency of the two\nallegations under Guideline J and ignored the record as a whole.  While the Board is not convinced\nafter a reading of the decision that the Judge ignored the record wholesale, he did fail to consider\nimportant evidence in evaluating lack of recency as a mitigating factor.  Applicant admitted at the\nhearing that he used marijuana up to the time of his December 2002 conviction for drug possession.\nThis revelation at the hearing established that, in addition to falsifying his June 21, 2004 security\nclearance application, Applicant apparently falsified a set of interrogatories (included in the record\nas Government Exhibit 2) on November 14, 2005 by indicating that he last used marijuana in\nSeptember 2001.   The Judge made a finding that Applicant had not used any illegal drugs since\n4\nbefore his December 2, 2002 court date but did not reference the 2002 date or the discrepancy\nbetween Applicant\u2019s last admitted marijuana use and Applicant\u2019s answer on the 2005 interrogatory\nwhen applying the mitigating factor.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s assessment of the recency of Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal conduct failed to take into consideration an additional likely instance of criminal activity\n(falsification, a violation of Title 18, United States Code, section 1001) that took place almost a year\nand a half after the June 2004 falsification that was evaluated by the Judge.  Given evidence that\nstrongly suggests an additional falsification in November 2005 and given the totality of the evidence,\non this record it was not reasonable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was\nnot recent.\nA similar analysis pertains to Department Counsel\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s\napplication of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6.  While Department Counsel\u2019s argument\nregarding a probation violation lacks merit, he persuasively argues that the record evidence does not\nsupport the Judge\u2019s conclusions concerning successful rehabilitation.  As pointed out by Department\nCounsel, Applicant has a long history of drug abuse (his use of marijuana began in 1968), including\ninstances of temporary decreases in drug use followed by increases (this includes a 2001 relapse\nwhere Applicant began smoking marijuana again and then, for the first time, began occasionally\nusing cocaine).  The record also establishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after his September\n2001 arrest and up until his December 2002 conviction, willfully continuing this illegal conduct as\nlong as possible, in part because Applicant understood that he would be tested for drugs once he was\nplaced on probation. Department Counsel also aptly notes that Applicant has been on probation since\nhis 2002 conviction and that his rehabilitation since that time has been largely dependant upon the\ncontrolling influences inherent in probation.  The Judge does not address the fact of Applicant\u2019s\ncontinuing probation in his analysis of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6.  Nothing in the\nDirective indicates that an applicant\u2019s current probationary status is a per se bar to a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  Nor is it a per se bar to the application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition 6.  However, the fact that Applicant will remain on probation until 2008 (Government\n\nDecision at 10.\n5\n6\nExhibit 3) cannot simply be disregarded.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1115 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n6, 1992).  In light of the requirement of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6 that there be \u201cclear\nevidence\u201d of successful rehabilitation, Applicant\u2019s ongoing status of probation, where he can be\nexpected to exhibit good behavior or face significant adverse consequences if he does not do so,\nsignificantly undercuts the Judge\u2019s favorable application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition\n6.\nThen there is the matter of Applicant\u2019s June 2004 falsification and the apparent additional\nfalsification of November 2005 that is established by the record evidence.  The Judge\u2019s analysis\nsuffers from the same infirmity here that it did under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 in\nthat consideration of a likely second, more recent falsification, which established a pattern of\nconduct, is absent.  The Judge also committed error when assigning mitigating value to Applicant\u2019s\nexpression of \u201ccontrition\u201d regarding his June 2004 falsification.  A more detailed analysis of the\nJudge\u2019s consideration of Applicant\u2019s contrition as a matter in mitigation is contained in succeeding\nparagraphs dealing with the Judge\u2019s \u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis.  For purposes of analyzing Applicant\u2019s\ncontrition under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6, it is sufficient to point out that evaluating\nan expression of contrition without consideration of the apparent additional act of falsification in\n2005 was error.  These errors, combined with the matters discussed in the preceding paragraph,\nrender the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6 arbitrary and\ncapricious.              \n        \nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is arbitrary and\ncapricious because it engages in piecemeal analysis and fails to consider record evidence.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  In his whole-person analysis, the Judge emphasized\nApplicant\u2019s behavior at the hearing\u2013his openness about his past drug use and his life in general\u2013and\nhis testimony concerning rehabilitation.  The Judge stressed the \u201c\u2018whole person\u2019 that [Applicant] is\ntoday.\u201d   These were matters that the Judge was obviously entitled to take into consideration when\n5\nassessing the \u201cwhole-person.\u201d  However, a whole-person analysis is intended to be a commonsense\nevaluation of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-\n0628 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2003).  In focusing on Applicant\u2019s conduct at the hearing along with\nhis current attitudes and demeanor, the Judge gave insufficient weight to the portions of the record\ndealing with Applicant\u2019s overall patterns of drug use and falsification.  Indeed, regarding Applicant\u2019s\nentire history, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis suffers from the same errors of omission that exist\nin his analysis of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1 and 6. \nAnother significant component of the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was his conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s June 2004 falsification was mitigated by his \u201ccontrition regarding his SF-86 answers.\u201d\nThis conclusion warrants a separate, detailed discussion.      \nWhen analyzing the case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), the Judge concluded that\nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts regarding drug use on his SF-86, and that Personal\n\n\u201cThe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n6\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\nSOR allegation 3.a.  The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to another question on his June\n7\n21, 2004 security clearance application concerning alcohol-related treatment (allegation 3.b.).  The Judge found that\nApplicant did not engage in falsification as stated in allegation 3.b.  Department Counsel did not appeal the Judge\u2019s\nfinding regarding this allegation.   \nHearing Transcript at 37.\n8\n7\nConduct Disqualifying Condition 2  applied.   The Judge concluded that none of the Personal\n6\n7\nConduct Mitigating Conditions applied.  The Judge then stated that Applicant now appreciates that\nsuch conduct was wrong and expresses contrition.  Under his whole-person analysis, the Judge\nrepeated his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s contrition was a mitigating factor.  Given his conclusion\nthat none of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions applied, Applicant\u2019s contrition and\nadmission of wrongdoing were the only bases for the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification had ben mitigated.  Using these factors, the Judge entered formal findings in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor regarding the June 2004 falsification under both Guideline J and Guideline E.\nWebster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines the act of being contrite as \u201cgrieving and\npenitent for sin or shortcoming.\u201d  A review of the record evidence in this case does not support the\nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant was contrite regarding his false answer to the question about drugs\non his June 2004 security clearance application.  When discussing his false answer, Applicant\nindicated only that he admitted the answer was false.   There are no expressions of regret, remorse,\n8\nor apology in the record on the part of Applicant regarding his false answer.  Notwithstanding the\ndeference the Board must give to a Judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions concerning an Applicant\u2019s\nhearing demeanor, in this case there is insufficient objective testimonial evidence in the record to\nsupport the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant demonstrated anguish over his answer and contrition for\nhaving answered the question in the negative.  Even if the record had contained evidence of\ncontrition sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s finding, that evidence would have been of limited\nprobative value.  While sincere expressions of remorse are the first steps on the road to\nrehabilitation, they are not evidence that demonstrates a track record of reform and rehabilitation.\nSee, e.g., ISCR case No. 94-1109 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 1996).  \nClosely related to\u2013but distinct from\u2013expressions of contrition are admissions of wrongdoing.\nThere is record evidence to support the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant has admitted wrongdoing with\nregard to the falsification.  An applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of the wrongfulness of his or her past\nconduct, if found to be credible, has some probative value with respect to a Judge\u2019s consideration\nof whether an applicant has demonstrated reform and rehabilitation sufficient to mitigate a\nfalsification.  However, as in the case of expressions of remorse and regret, such an acknowledgment\nis merely a first step and is likewise of limited probative value.  ISCR Case No. 98-0424 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 16, 1999).  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of the wrongfulness of his past\nconduct cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be considered in light of the record evidence as a\nwhole, including evidence that fairly detracts from it.  See Directive, Additional Procedural\nGuidance, Item 32.a.  Given the totality of the record evidence in this case, Applicant\u2019s mere\nadmission of wrongdoing is insufficient to mitigate his June 2004 falsification.\n\n8\nDepartment Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating harmful error that warrants reversal.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNicole Noel, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns arising from\ndelinquent debts of $62,000 including a repossession of $57,000 by failing to resolve the debts or\nmake any concrete efforts pay them. While he recently engaged the services of a credit counselor the\n\n2\naction was too late with little effect. He did mitigate personal conduct allegations for failure to report\ndelinquent debts on his SF 86 by a showing of confusion and lack of experience with the application\nprocess. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn June 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn June 20, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to another judge who scheduled a hearing on October 16, 2006. The hearing was\nconvened and Applicant requested an extension of time to prepare his case, and it was postponed\nto an indefinite date. The matter was assigned to me on November 1, 2006. A notice of hearing was\nissued on November 17, 2006, for a hearing on December 4, 2006, and held that day. The\ngovernment offered five exhibits and Applicant offered two into evidence. All were accepted.\nApplicant requested an opportunity to submit additional material and the request was granted to\nallow submissions until January 15, 2007. Nothing was received. The transcript was received on\nDecember 15, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations relating to delinquent debts with explanation for\nsome and admitted the withholding information regarding them on his applicant for security\nclearance with explanation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has worked as a security\nofficer for the past three years. He is married with three pre-teenage children. He incurred debts\ntotaling approximately $62,000 over several years that have become delinquent. The largest debt is\nfor $57,000 for a mobile home repossession. The remaining seven debts are relatively small. He\nretained a credit counseling service in early November 2006 and they are working to repair his debts\n(Exh. A).\nApplicant and his wife both work and their respective annual salaries are $43,000 and\n$12,000 (Tr. 34). They have over $400 left each month after payment of all expenses (Tr. 38). He\nowns a 2004 truck that he purchased new and makes payments of $500 per month (Tr. 42). They\nhave lived at a variety of addresses over the past ten years and that may account for some of the\n\n3\ndifficulties in keeping track of bills. Applicant has never held a security clearance but now needs one\nto obtain access to some buildings where his employer wants to assign him to work. He is highly\nregarded by his supervisor for hard work, dependability, and for going the \u201cextra mile\u201d to accomplish\nhis tasks (Exh. B). \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in 2001 and advised him that he would\nstart to make payments (Exh. 2). He has not yet done so. In 2005 he submitted answers to\ninterrogatories posed by the government and advised that he was going to seek the assistance of a\ncredit counselor (Exh. 3). He did not do so until over a year later. \nApplicant omitted information concerning the delinquent debts at Questions 38 and 39\nrelating to delinquent debts of 180 and 90 days on his application for a security clearance (SF 86)\ndated November 13, 2003. It was his first experience with the security clearance process. \nThe following is an analysis of the status of the eight delinquent debts alleged in the SOR:\n1. SOR 1.a.:$1,308. Credit counselor is attempting to contact.\n2. SOR 1.b.:$57,551. Repossession of a mobile home that Applicant purchased for $65,000.\nA relative moved in and failed to make payments and it was repossessed for non payment.\nApplicant has not been solicited to pay the debt since discussing it with creditor two years\nago when a settlement offer for $10,000 was made by the creditor. \n3. SOR 1.c.:$346 Creditor charged off the debt in 2001 but nothing has been done since. \n4. SOR 1.d.: $543. Cable company installed a box which was returned. Debt has not been\nsettled since placed for collection in 2001. \n5. SOR 1.e.: $1,212 Security system left in a former residence. Still outstanding since placed\nfor collection in 2001. \n6. SOR 1.f.: $426 Telephone bill that is still outstanding since placed for collection in 2002.\n7. SOR 1.g.: $498 Telephone bill that is still outstanding since 2002.\n8. SOR 1.h.: $193 Electric bill that is still outstanding since placed for collection in 2003.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\n\n4\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concern under\nGuideline F since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence\nof inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) might\ninclude the fact that the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (E2.A6.1.3.3.), the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (E2.A6.1.3.4.), and the\nperson has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n(E2.A6.1.3.6.). \nThere is little evidence the debts resulted from conditions beyond his control. He is now\nreceiving counseling help but only engaged the service after the first hearing was held in this matter.\nIt is also unclear whether he has instructed the counselor to work out a payment program or only to\ntry to identify errors in his credit reports. However, it is clear that the credit problems are not now\nresolved. While he has initiated an effort to resolve his problems he has waited too late for the\nmitigating conditions to be applicable. He requested a continuance to begin work on his financial\nproblems, received it, and over a month later could only show that he had retained credit counseling\nservices. He was also given an opportunity to provide information after the second hearing and failed\nto respond.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his financial delinquencies at Questions 38 and 39 on his SF 86\nraises issues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). Specifically, the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application\ncould raise a security concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) Applicant\u2019s explanation of the\ncircumstances of the filing and his lack of knowledge of the process and an understanding of the\nquestions in 2003 is believable and thus, I cannot conclude that it was deliberate. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\nimpressed me at the hearing as a hard-working person who was unfamiliar with the process and may\nhave had good intentions but not the ability to resolve them to the government\u2019s satisfaction. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that a security clearance should not be granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\nis denied. \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on October 16, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 22, 2007, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 6, 2007. \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf but did not submit any documentary \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 15, 2007.  \n \nThe Administrative Judge who conducted the hearing left DOHA before a \ndecision in this case was issued. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2008. I \ncontacted Department Counsel and requested he contact Applicant and see if Applicant \ndesired that I reopen the hearing for additional evidence or if Applicant desired that I \nbase my decision on the transcript and evidence submitted at the first hearing. Applicant \nrequested that I reopen the hearing. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 23, \n2008, and I reopened the hearing as scheduled on February 5, 2008. The government \ndid not offer any additional documentary evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. \nHe did not submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the \nsecond hearing (Tr. (2)) on February 13, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nThe Administrative Judge advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the \nDirective to 15 days notice before the first hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his \nright to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with the exception of \u00b6 1.g, which he denied. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He is a college \ngraduate with a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master\u2019s degree. He is married and \nhas a child that is about six months old.1  \n \n \nApplicant attended college from 1995 to 2001. He started working as a veterinary \nassistant at an animal hospital when he was in high school and continued while he was \nin college. Applicant was involved in a number of incidents related to the animal \nhospital. Between about 1995 and 1998, while working at the animal hospital, Applicant \nkilled several cats by injecting them with bleach. Applicant was the senior employee at \nthe hospital on occasions when co-workers gave unauthorized bleach injections to cats \nthat were scheduled to be euthanized. This was not the proper humane means to \neuthanize animals. A co-worker suggested to Applicant that he should try it and he did. \nApplicant admitted that \u201c[once he] did it for the first time, [he] was still curious and tried a \nsecond time.\u201d When asked if the cats suffered, Applicant testified, \u201c[I]t\u2019s hard to say, I \nguess.\u201d Applicant described the deaths as similar to what occurred when the cats were \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 12-13; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninjected with the standard medication used to euthanize animals; they would stretch out \nand die.2 He was asked: \n \n \nQ: I guess I\u2019m trying to understand if it\u2019s the same, why even do it? \n \nA: I mean - - I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one of those things where you\u2019re young and \nyou do a stupid thing and you don\u2019t think about it being that big of a deal \nuntil you think back - - think back on it. And you don\u2019t really have an \nexcuse for it. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably one of the stupidest things I\u2019ve \never done.3  \n \n \nApplicant was required to enter the time he started and ended work at the animal \nhospital on a computer. Applicant learned how to manipulate the computer. On about 40 \noccasions between about 1995 and 1998, Applicant changed the computer to reflect \nthat he reported to work on time, when he was actually late by about five to ten minutes. \nApplicant stated that he had no good reason for manipulating the computer as his boss \ndid not care that he was several minutes late. He further stated that he did not do it for \nthe money as he often worked after hours without pay in order to help out.4  \n \n \nThe owner of the animal hospital also operated a Christmas tree business during \nthe holidays. Applicant and other co-workers were sometimes called from the animal \nhospital to assist on the Christmas tree lot. This angered them and they stole money \nfrom the sale of the trees. Applicant stated that he would take $20 here or there and \nestimated that the total amount that he stole between about 1995 and 1998 was $500 or \nless.5  \n \n \nBetween about 1999 and 2000, a co-worker at the animal hospital asked \nApplicant if he would provide her with a urine sample. Her husband had used marijuana. \nShe wanted to give the urine to her husband so that he could substitute Applicant\u2019s \nurine for his on a drug test. Applicant stated that he felt sorry for the woman because \nher husband was abusive to her and he provided her with his urine on about three \noccasions. He stated the husband worked for a construction company and was not \ninvolved in government work.6  \n \n \nIn about 2000, Applicant and his friends vandalized public restrooms by urinating \nall over the restroom. He stated they were drunk the first time they did it. After that they \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 19, 56; Tr.

He estimated that he did this on about \nten occasions.7  \n \n \nFrom about 1995 to 2004, Applicant committed copyright violations by unlawfully \ndownloading computer software, movies, and music. This started when Applicant was in \ncollege. Applicant stated at that time it was considered unusual to purchase software \ninstead of pirating it. He rationalized his actions by the fact that he could not have \npurchased the software because he did not have the money, so the companies were \nnot really losing money. He continued the practice after he graduated from college even \nthough he could afford to pay for the software, movies, and music. He stated he \u201cwas so \naccustomed to just getting them for free that it was hard to stop and start paying for \nthem.\u201d Applicant testified he \u201cstopped doing it once [he] went through the security \nprocess because [he] realized this could adversely affect it.\u201d He testified that he did not \nthink of it as something that mattered until he was asked about it during his polygraph in \nabout 2004.8  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a number of occasions between about 1995 and \n1999. The exact amount of times is unclear as he has provided varying information. \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on January 28, 2002. \nQuestion 27 asked: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYES.\u201d He listed the period from \u201c1995/06/01\u201d to \u201c1995/06/02.\u201d \nUnder \u201cNAME/FREQUENCY\u201d he listed \u201cMARIJUANA\u201d and \u201c2.\u201d 9 \n \n \nApplicant had a background interview about six to eight weeks after he submitted \nhis SF 86. He told the investigator that he thought he used marijuana about five times, \nbut he could not be sure. Applicant was given a polygraph for his background \ninvestigation in about 2004. He told the polygrapher that he thought he used marijuana \nabout five times between 1995 and 1999, but it could have been more. He stated that \nhe thought it was less than ten times but he was 100% certain it was less than 20 times. \nApplicant submitted another SF 86 on February 14, 2005. Applicant again answered \n\u201cYES\u201d to Question 27. He listed the period from \u201c1994/04/01\u201d to \u201c1999/12/31.\u201d Under \n\u201cNAME/FREQUENCY\u201d he listed \u201cMARIJUANA\u201d and \u201c15.\u201d Applicant wrote in the General \nRemarks section, \u201cI would like to state that the number of my uses of marijuana were \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 23-24; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4. \n \n8 Tr. at 24-27, 57-58; Tr. (2) at 18-20; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4. \n \n9 GE 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nestimated. I believe it was less times.\u201d In his response to Interrogatories in May 2007, \nApplicant stated he still believed he used marijuana on less than ten occasions. He \nstated that after discussing it with his wife, he remembered that the first time was on St. \nPatrick\u2019s Day in 1995, and that he did not use it after meeting his wife in December \n1998. During his first hearing he testified he told the polygrapher that he was 100% sure \nthat it was less than 15 occasions. He testified that the first time he used marijuana was \nin May 1995, when he went to visit a friend at a college, and it was May 1995, not June \n1995, that were the two times that he was thinking of when he answered his SF 86. He \ntestified at his first hearing that he smoked marijuana with friends from work, starting \nabout 1996. He stated he would go to parties and some of his friends had marijuana, \nand \u201csometimes [he] would and sometimes [he] wouldn\u2019t [use marijuana],\u201d but \u201c[i]t \nwasn\u2019t like an all the time thing.\u201d He also testified that he believed it was actually \nbetween five and ten times. At his second hearing, he testified that he believed he used \nmarijuana between five and ten times and probably closer to five.10  \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying the 2002 SF 86. He stated that he \nmisinterpreted the question and that he thought the question asked him to list all the \ntimes that he had used marijuana, similar to the question that asked to list all the places \nthat he had lived. He stated he listed the two occasions that he knew the dates that he \nused marijuana. He indicated that he knew he would speak with an investigator and he \nwould tell the investigator that it was more than two occasions, but he did not have \ndates for the other occasions. He stated that he was not concerned that his marijuana \nuse would affect his security clearance because of the time that had passed since he \nlast used it. He admitted that he was concerned about his company finding out about his \nmarijuana use. He further testified that his concern about his company finding out he \nsmoked marijuana had nothing to do with his answer to the SF 86, and that if he was \ntruly concerned about his company and was willing to lie on the SF 86 to conceal his \ndrug use, that he would not have listed any use.11 After considering all the evidence \nincluding Applicant\u2019s various statements and after gauging his demeanor and credibility, \nI find Applicant intentionally falsified his Security Clearance Application in 2002, by \nlisting that he only used marijuana on two occasions in 1995. I further find that Applicant \nwas untruthful in his response to Interrogatories, in his Answer to the SOR, and during \nboth hearings when he denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86.12 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 28-34, 39-43, 49-52; Tr.

(2) at 7-11, 20-27; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4. \n \n12 Applicant\u2019s false statements which were not alleged in the SOR are not considered for \ndisqualifying purposes, but may be considered when analyzing the \u201cwhole person\u201d and the potential \napplication of mitigating conditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s polygraph in 2004, he was told he did not pass the polygraph \nand was asked why he thought he did not pass.13 At that time Applicant revealed the \ninformation discussed above which formed the basis for the allegations in the SOR. He \nwas denied access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in about February \n2005, based upon much of the matter that he discussed with the polygrapher and which \nare currently listed as allegations in the SOR.14 \n \n \nApplicant stated he is deeply remorseful for what he has done, that he has \nchanged from the young man who made poor choices, and that he has learned from his \nmistakes. He praises his wife as the stabilizing influence in his life. He has moved away \nfrom the bad influences in college and at the animal hospital. He and his wife bought a \nhouse about five years ago and he states he no longer is involved in questionable \nconduct.15 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n13 There is no evidence that Applicant actually was deceptive on his polygraph, as opposed to \nbeing told he was deceptive as part of an interview/interrogation technique. The results of the polygraph \nare not considered in determining the facts of this case or Applicant\u2019s credibility. The polygraph is only \nconsidered for the affect it had on Applicant admitting to his conduct.  \n \n14 Tr. at 27, 30-34, 44-47; Tr. (2) at 19; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4. \n \n15 Tr. at 34-39; Tr. (2) at 35-37; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \n \n           Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a through 1.f, raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), (d), and (e). The intentional falsification of his SF 86 raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n\n \n9 \n \n \n16(e). The fact that Applicant was denied access to SCI in 2005, based upon the \nconduct that is addressed in these proceedings does not independently raise any \ndisqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability;  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and the individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s conduct occurred while he was in college. The conduct in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b61.a through 1.e occurred in 2000, or earlier. The most recent conduct alleged \nwas the unlawful downloading of copyrighted material as alleged in SOR \u00b61.f, which \nended in 2004. Applicant has made many positive changes in his life since those times. \nHis wife is a stabilizing influence and he is a new father. They have established roots by \nbuying a house about five years ago. He has disassociated himself from the negative \ninfluences in his life. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), (e), and (g) are raised for those allegations.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant falsified his SF 86 in 2002, by minimizing the number of times he used \nmarijuana, and when he used it last. He provided additional information to his \nbackground investigator several months later when he was questioned about his drug \nuse. He provided all the information that formed the basis for the allegations in the SOR \nafter the polygrapher told him that he failed the polygraph. Applicant provided additional \ninformation about his marijuana use in his 2005 SF 86. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (e) are partially \napplicable because of those actions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant engaged in reprehensible \nconduct when he was younger. Along with other misconduct, he stole from his \nemployer, manipulated his employer\u2019s timekeeping equipment, vandalized public \nrestrooms, provided urine samples to a co-worker so that her husband could pass a \ndrug test, and killed cats by injecting them with bleach. Applicant\u2019s actions with the cats \ncarries such a stigma that it is difficult to say when it would no longer serve as a basis \nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. His misconduct goes to the heart of his \ntrustworthiness. He receives credit for the positive changes in his life discussed above. \nHowever, Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86. He was untruthful in his response to \nInterrogatories, in his Answer to the SOR, and during both hearings. Without total \ncandor, I am unable to find that he has been rehabilitated or that there is little likelihood \nof continuation or recurrence of his misconduct. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his Personal \nConduct.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 7, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn July 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines E and F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 10, 2007, and requested\nan Administrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 16, 2007. Applicant did not\nrespond to the FORM.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1988. His case was \u201cclosed\u201d in\n1989 (Exhibit 6). In his SOR response, applicant stated he \u201cincurred about a year or so\nof unemployment in the \u201880s. Prior to the period of unemployment my bills were paid on\ntime.\u201d\nApplicant admits he was indebted to the IRS for back taxes, penalties, and\ninterest in the following amounts for the following years:\n1987: $2,351.00\n1988: $3,248.00\n1994: $5,558.00\n1995: $15,862.00\n1996: $13,030.00\n1997: $17,463.00\n1998: $6,350.00\n1999: $8,714.00\n2000: $18,940.00\n2001: $6,909.00\n2002: $1,025.00\n2003: $2,193.00\nIn 1989, two Federal tax liens were filed against applicant for nonpayment of his\n1987 and 1988 income tax. In 1996, another lien was filed for nonpayment of his 1994\nincome tax. In 1998, two more liens were filed for nonpayment of his 1995 and 1996\nincome taxes. In 1999, another lien was filed for nonpayment of his 1997 income tax.\nApplicant admits he was indebted to the State of Oklahoma (OTC) for back\ntaxes, penalties and interest (1) in the total amount of $9,950.00 for tax years 1994,\n1995, 1996, and 1997; (2) in the amount of $997.00 for tax year 1998; (3) in the amount\nof $2,024.00 for tax year 1999; (4) in the total amount of $3,983.00 for tax years 2000\nand 2001; and (5) in the amount of $5,492.00 for tax year 2003.\nIn his SOR response, applicant addressed his tax debts. With respect to the IRS\ndebts, he stated that his 1987, 1988, 1994, and 1995 tax debts have \u201cbeen cancelled by\nthe Internal Revenue Service\u201d and he is \u201cunable to make any payments\u201d for these tax\nyears. With respect to tax years 1996 through 2001, he stated \u201carrangements are being\nmade to settle\u201d these debts. With respect to tax years 2002 and 2003, he stated these\ndebts were paid in 2007. With respect to his OTC income tax debts, he stated\n\u201carrangements are being made to settle\u201d all of them.\nApplicant attached a letter from an Oklahoma accountant who, according to the\naccountant, \u201chas in the past and is currently working with [applicant] in regards in [sic]\nthe process of satisfying various legal tax obligations stated in [the SOR].\u201d In the letter,\n\n3\nthe accountant stated applicant\u2019s IRS tax debts for years 1987, 1988, 1994, and 1995\nare \u201cno longer contested by the IRS and [are] considered to have been satisfied within\ntheir system,\u201d and his 2002 and 2003 tax debts have been paid. The accountant further\nstated that when they complete and file applicant\u2019s 2004, 2005, and 2006 income tax\nreturns, applicant will be entitled to approximately $40,000.00 in refunds, which will be\napplied to his remaining tax debts. The accountant did not address the Oklahoma tax\ndebts. No documentation was provided to corroborate any of the accountant\u2019s\nstatements.\nIn a signed, sworn statement he gave to an OPM investigator in March 2006,\napplicant stated the following:\nI am indebted to the IRS and OTC in previous tax years because I\ndisagreed with the amount owed. Because I didn\u2019t agree with the amount\ndue for these previous tax years, I withheld payment.\nApplicant was indebted to a health care provider in the amount of $1,398.00. The\ndebt was sent to a collection agency. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated he\nthought the debt was taken care of because the medical services provided were for a\nwork-related injury covered by workers compensation law. He further stated that he\ncontacted his attorney and asked him to get the bill settled. Unlike his tax debts, this\ndebt appears to be the result of a mistake. Accordingly, I find it has no current security\nsignificance.\nApplicant falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SCA) he\nexecuted in April 2004 when, (1) in response to Question 36, he denied having any tax\nliens filed against his property during the previous seven years, (2) in response to\nQuestion 38, he denied he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt during the\nprevious seven years, and (3) in response to Question 39, he denied he was then over\n90 days delinquent on any debt. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated, in\nessence, that his false answers were mistakes.\n \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\n\n4\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security\nconcerns. The evidence shows applicant has a long history of not paying his State and\nFederal income tax obligations. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph a. may apply where\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n\n5\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his\nincome tax when due was recent, frequent, and intentional. This mitigation condition is\nnot applicable.\nUnder Paragraph b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Although\nthe financial problems that caused applicant to file for bankruptcy in the 1980s were,\naccording to applicant, caused by a lengthy period of unemployment, he failed to\nprovide credible evidence that his unemployment was beyond his control, or that he\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. With respect to his income tax debts, the\nevidence establishes that applicant intentionally let them go delinquent and then ignored\nthem. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph c. Applicant has presented evidence that he\nretained an accountant to help him resolve his income tax delinquencies, and that the\naccountant has taken some action toward that goal. However, given applicant\u2019s history,\nthis evidence falls short of establishing the problem is being resolved or is under control.\nThis mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d In his SOR response,\napplicant stated (1) the IRS cancelled his 1987, 1988, 1994 and 1995 tax debts, and (2)\nhe paid his delinquent 2002 and 2003 IRS debts. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide any\ndocumentation from the IRS corroborating these statements make them suspect,\nparticularly in light of his concealment of his tax liens and debts and when he completed\nthe SCA. However, even if he were given credit for the elimination of these debts, he\nhas not provided evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve his remaining tax debts. His\nvague statement that \u201carrangements are being made\u201d to settle his remaining IRS debts\n(totaling approximately $72,000), and his State income tax debts (totaling approximately\n$22,000.00), is hardly sufficient to conclude a good-faith effort is underway. This\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nIt may be mitigating under Paragraph e. if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis\nto dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Since applicant provided no reason for his\ndisagreement with the IRS and OTC over the amount of taxes owed, there is no way to\nconclude his position was reasonable. This mitigating condition does not apply.\n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This disqualifying condition is\napplicable because applicant intentionally provided false, material information in\nresponse to three questions on the SCA he completed in April 2004.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of ignoring his income tax obligations. In 2004, he concealed this derogatory\ninformation from the Government when he was asked about it on an SCA. His conduct\nwas intentional, serious, frequent, and recent. In view of these facts, I conclude\napplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Guidelines E and F.\n\n7\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 26, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on December 3, 2007.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 5, 2008. During the hearing, I received nine government\nexhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony.

As of December 18, 2007, this debt\nhad not been paid.\nSubparagraph 1.h: You are indebted to [State X] for a state tax lien filed on\nAugust 27, 2007, in the amount of $9,591. As of December 18, 2007, this debt\nhad not been paid.\nAt the hearing, department counsel moved to withdraw SOR Paragraph 3.  Applicant\n1\ndid not object, and I granted both motions.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45 year old man with two adult children, ages 18 and 24. His\nmarriage ended in divorce in 1995. He has a bachelor of arts degree in physics, and is\nplanning on returning to school to finish a master\u2019s degree in computational math (Tr.\n20). \nApplicant is a network engineer who provides subject matter expertise in the\npolicies and technology associated with upgrading large, government network systems\n(Id.). \nIn 1995, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a lien against Applicant\u2019s\nproperty in the approximate amount of $14,005 for tax years 1991, 1992, and 1994.\nApproximately $10,500 of this delinquency stemmed from tax year 1991. Through 1990,\nhe and his wife filed income taxes jointly. Applicant claimed payroll deductions based\nupon their joint filing status. In 1991, he and his wife grew estranged, and they stopped\nfiling their income taxes jointly. Because Applicant never adjusted his payroll deductions\nto reflect his new filing status, he owed a deficit at the year\u2019s end that he was unable to\npay. By the time the IRS entered the lien in 1995, the delinquency had grown to\n$10,350 (Tr. 24).\nThe remainder of the lien covers tax years 1992 and 1994. These delinquencies\nwere generated because Applicant continued to struggle to calculate his payroll\ndeductions accurately, and was unable to pay the deficits when due.\n\nApplicant requested and received software from the online software company he used to prepare his taxes,\n2\nbut has thus far been unable to retrieve the old returns (Tr. 29).\n3\nApplicant negotiated a payment plan with the IRS (Tr. 14). By 1998, he had paid\nthe delinquency, and the IRS released the lien (Ex. B).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, and 1.h allege three state tax liens totalling\napproximately $19,000 for tax years 2002 through 2004. Applicant admits he owed a tax\ndelinquency, but denied the amount due. The state has been applying his tax returns to\nthe delinquency since 2005. In approximately June 2007, Applicant contacted the taxing\nauthority to confirm the amount due, and to arrange a payment plan (Exhibit 2).\nBecause of a discrepancy involving his electronic tax filings for those years, the state\ntold Applicant he needed to re-file his returns. He was unable to do so because all of his\nold tax records were destroyed when his basement flooded (Tr. 22).2\nAfter the government filed the SOR, Applicant again contacted the taxing\nauthority to obtain paperwork confirming the remaining amount of the delinquent taxes\n(Tr. 31). Two weeks after the hearing, he received correspondence from the taxing\nauthority that states he owes nothing for tax year 2003, that all of the outstanding tax\nliens had been satisfied and released(Exhibits E through H), and that he owed $253 for\ntax year 2006 (Exhibit D at 1). Applicant then satisfied the 2006 delinquency.\nAs of January 2007, Applicant owed three commercial delinquencies, listed in\nSOR subparagraphs 1.c through 1.e, in the approximate amount of $850. He paid SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c, a dental bill, in September 2007 (Answer at 3). He received oral\nconfirmation that he had paid the obligation in SOR subparagraph 1.d, a phone bill, (Tr.\n25). He is waiting for written confirmation. He satisfied the debt in SOR subparagraph\n1.e, a bank, in September 2007 (Answer at 4, Tr. 25).\nSOR subparagraph 1.f is a debt allegedly owed on a corporate credit card\nApplicant used in the late 1990s. When he left the company and returned the card in\nJanuary 1999, it had a zero balance (Exhibit 3 at 3). Applicant continued to receive\ncharges through April 1999 (Tr. 26). He disputed them, and made numerous requests to\nresolve the issue over the years. He last wrote the creditor in May 2007 (Exhibit 2 at 7).\nIn August 2007, he spoke with a representative of the creditor and provided his social\nsecurity number, the date the account should have been terminated, and his address.\nHe has received neither a written nor oral response (Tr. 37).\nApplicant was unemployed nearly all of 1999, and for 14 months between 2003\nand 2004 (Tr. 14). Currently, he earns approximately $128,000 per year (Tr. 43). He has\napproximately $110,000 in savings (Exhibit 2 at 3). He has $700 remaining each month\nafter expenses have been paid (Tr. 46).\nApplicant has physical custody of his 18 year old child who is severely disabled\nand requires the assistance of a home care aide. This service costs Applicant $275 per\nweek.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s accrual of delinquent income tax indebtedness and other\nmiscellaneous indebtedness, between 1991 and 2006 triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201chistory or unwillingness to satisfy debts, 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies in the early 1990s stemmed from problems\nseparating his finances from his wife\u2019s finances during their estrangement preceding\n\n5\ntheir divorce. He negotiated a payment plan, and satisfied these tax delinquencies by\n1998.\nBetween 1999 and 2004, Applicant was unemployed intermittently for nearly two\nand a half years. Since then, he has satisfied all of the delinquencies he admitted, and\nprovided a credible explanation supported by documentation for the one delinquency he\ndenied. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(c) \u201c. . . there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201dand\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provide[d] documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d apply. He has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant struggled with his finances in the early 1990's and his financial\nproblems recurred ten years later. These problems were caused by a divorce and two\nlengthy periods of unemployment rather than by any irresponsible spending. Currently,\nApplicant is financially stable, has satisfied all of his delinquencies, and has substantial\nsavings. Upon evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I\nconclude the likelihood of recurrence is minimal. Applicant\u2019s past financial problems no\nlonger pose a security concern. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n6\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nWITHDRAWN\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Pursuant to the government\u2019s motion, the SOR is hereby\n1\namended to reflect the correct spelling.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E2.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992) as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 23, 2006,1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (criminal conduct),\nGuideline H (drug involvement), and Guideline E (personal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense\neffective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was\nissued.\nApplicant filed an initial answer dated November 1, 2006, that was not considered responsive\nin that he did not indicate whether he wanted a hearing. On December 18, 2006, Applicant submitted\nhis original answer annotated with a request for a decision based on the written record without a\nhearing. The government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 29, 2007,\nconsisting of nine exhibits (Items 1-9). Through correspondence dated January 30, 2007, DOHA\nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nNo rebuttal had been filed by Applicant as of the March 14, 2007 due date. On April 9, 2007, the\ncase was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, that Applicant was given probation\nbefore judgment for October 2004 driving under the influence and related charges (\u00b6 1.a) and for\nAugust 1997 possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia charges (\u00b6 1.b). The drug charges were\ncross-referenced under Guideline H, drug involvement (\u00b6 2.b). In addition, Applicant was alleged\nunder Guideline H to have used marijuana from about 1996 to at least 2004 (\u00b6 2.a). DOHA alleged\nunder Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J that Applicant deliberately falsified his\nFebruary 2004 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) by denying any drug-related\narrests (\u00b6 3.a)  and any use of illegal drugs within the seven years preceding his application (\u00b6 3.b),\ncommitting thereby a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (\u00b6 1.c). \nApplicant responded \u201cI admit\u201d to the arrests (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.b), to the marijuana use (\u00b6 2.a),\nand to his failures to disclose the criminal drug charges (\u00b6 3.a) and marijuana use (\u00b6 3.b) on his\nclearance application, but provided a detailed response in which he denied the intentional\nfalsification of his SF 86 (\u00b6\u00b6 3.a, and 3.b), and therefore by inference the violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1001 (\u00b6 1.c). Applicant\u2019s admissions to the criminal charges and dispositions and to the marijuana\nuse are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the documents before me for\nconsideration, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\n\n4\nApplicant is a 33-year-old married high school graduate who seeks a security clearance for\nhis duties with a defense contractor. After Applicant graduated from high school in June 1992, he\npursued vocational/technical training for five years. In about 1996, when he was 22, he began\nsmoking marijuana off and on. On completing his training in June 1997, he started working for his\npresent employer as a journeyman.\nApplicant continued to smoke marijuana on occasion, and in mid-August 1997, Applicant\nwas en route home with a friend from an acquaintance\u2019s home when he was stopped for crossing the\ncenter line. Applicant responded negatively to officer\u2019s inquiries as to whether he had any illegal\ndrugs in his possession, but he subsequently admitted he had a small bag of marijuana in the car. The\nofficer seized a small bag containing marijuana residue (seeds and stems) and Applicant and his\ncompanion were both arrested. Applicant pleaded guilty to charges of marijuana and drug\nparaphernalia possession, and was sentenced to probation before judgment. As conditions of his\nprobation, he attended three classes at a county treatment center and two Alcoholics Anonymous\nmeetings, and was subjected to breath and urine testing twice a week for three months. He completed\nthe requirements without incident.\nFollowing his arrest, and his marriage in 1999 to his spouse, who had a six-year-old daughter\nfrom a prior relationship, Applicant continued to smoke marijuana off and on, roughly twice a week\nduring periods of use. He typically purchased a quarter ounce bag of marijuana every two or three\nweeks, and smoked it from a pipe or bowl with his brother-in-law on the weekends for recreational\npurposes.\nOn February 15, 2004, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(SF 86) in application for a security clearance for his duties with the defense contractor. Applicant\nresponded negatively to police record inquiries, including question 23d. \u201cHave you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d and to illegal drug use\ninquiries, including question 24a. \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter,\nhave you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine,\nhashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates,\nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d.\nIn late October 2004, Applicant was pulled over by the police for failure to stay within\nmarked lanes. He was arrested for DUI, failure to drive right of center, and negligent driving after\nhe blew a .13% blood alcohol content on the breathalyser. Applicant did not think he was intoxicated\nat the time. In late December 2004, he began attending a level I substance abuse program on the\nadvice of his attorney. He attended two group counseling sessions weekly and one individual session\nper month for a total of 33 sessions, and was discharged before completing the full 39 sessions\noriginally planned because he was an outstanding client. When he appeared in court to answer for\nthe DUI, he was given probation before judgment.\nOn January 12, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a special investigator with the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigations service. He detailed his drug arrest in August 1997,\nand admitted he had used marijuana \u201coff and on again\u201d since about 1996 when he was 22 years old.\nHe continued to use marijuana \u201croughly twice a week\u201d up until his arrest in October 2004. Applicant\ntold the investigator he had stopped using marijuana in October 2004 because he wanted to be more\nresponsible and he did not intend to use any illegal drugs in the future. There is no indication in the\n\n5\nrecord as to whether Applicant was asked about his failure to list his drug use on his SF 86. As for\nhis alcohol consumption, he detailed the circumstances of his October 2004 arrest for DUI, admitting\nthat he had told the arresting officer he drank only two beers when he had consumed four within\nthree hours. Applicant disclosed that he was attending a substance abuse program twice per week\non the advice of his attorney, but he denied that he had a substance abuse problem. He indicated that\nhe typically consumed three beers once a week and so rarely to intoxication that he was unable to\nquantify the instances. Applicant asserted he was not susceptible to blackmail although due to\nembarrassment he had kept the fact of his DUI arrest from family and friends other than his spouse.\nOn October 23, 2005, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant, citing in part, security concerns\nstemming from his failure to list his August 1997 drug offense or his involvement with marijuana\non his SF 86. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated he had not listed the August 1997 drug\noffenses based on his understanding that they were expunged and therefore he assumed he did not\nhave to list them. Applicant did not directly address his failure to report his drug use on his clearance\napplication. Rather, he referred to his October 2004 arrest which occurred after he had submitted the\napplication. However, he also expressed hope that his \u201cmisguided answers\u201d did not jeopardize his\nfuture.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance. \n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n2\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts, including\nthe adjudicative guidelines, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines J, E, and H:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. AG \u00b6 30. Applicant\u2019s October 2004 DUI and August 1997 marijuana possession\nfall within Guideline J, criminal conduct, disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 31(a), a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses, and DC \u00b6 31(c), allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. The\ncharges are substantiated (in possession of marijuana residue in August 1997 and a .13% blood\nalcohol content in October 2004), even though he has no formal conviction on his record since he\nwas placed on probation before judgment in each case. Furthermore, Guideline J DC \u00b6 31(c) is also\nimplicated because of his lack of candor on his security clearance application (see Personal Conduct,\nsupra). Applicant committed a felony violation of \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately omitting\nrelevant and material information concerning his illegal drug involvement from his SF 86.2\n Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 23d. on his February 2004 SF 86 concerning whether\nhe had ever been charged with an alcohol or drug offense, even though he had been arrested and been\nplaced on probation before judgment for August 1997 marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia\npossession offenses. Applicant denies any intentional omission, claiming a belief that the charges\nwere to be expunged from his record and disclosure was not therefore required. As specified in the\nlanguage of question 23, the lone exception to mandatory disclosure is for those convictions under\nthe Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the\nauthority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607. Expungement by a state court pursuant to a state\nlaw would not fall within the exception, although a good faith mistaken reliance on such an\nexpungement order could negate the willful intent required for a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 violation.\nApplicant presented no expungement order that would substantiate a good faith belief that he did not\nhave to list the drug charges. Moreover, Applicant lacks credibility on this issue, given his negative\nresponse to the drug inquiries on the SF 86, including question 24a. At the time he completed his\nSF 86, he was still actively abusing marijuana on an occasional basis, as frequently as twice per\nweek. He offered no explanation for his failure to disclose his drug abuse history other than he\nbelieved his October 2004 arrest for drunk driving happened after he filed his clearance form. Had\nApplicant no intent to conceal his illegal drug involvement from the government, he would have at\na minimum responded affirmatively to question 24a. In addition to raising criminal conduct concerns\nas noted above, Applicant\u2019s knowing and willful concealment of his drug arrest and marijuana\ninvolvement falls within personal conduct AG \u00b6 15. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n7\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. DC \u00b6 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities, under Guideline E applies.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana from about 1996 to October 2004 raises independent\nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement. As set forth in AG \u00b6 24, use of an illegal drug or\nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment, and because it raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. DC \u00b6 25(a), any drug\nabuse, and DC \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, apply.\nApplicant has a heavy burden of showing mitigation, given the existence of credible adverse\ninformation in several different areas (falsification, drug use, alcohol abuse). Concerning the\nGuideline J concerns, mitigating conditions (MC) \u00b6 32(b) the person was pressured or coerced, and\n\u00b6 32(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense, clearly do not apply. Although he has\nnot been arrested on any illegal drug charges since 1997 (see \u00b6 32(a), so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or has happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) his drug-related criminal behavior continued to at least October 2004. Furthermore, the\ndrug charges, albeit dated, cannot be viewed in isolation from his more recent DUI and felonious\nfalse statements. There is no evidence to indicate his drunk driving was other than isolated, and he\nwas discharged early from his court-mandated counseling sessions because of his outstanding\nparticipation. However, I am unable to conclude that he is successfully rehabilitated from the\ncriminal conduct concerns where he remains unwilling to acknowledge the deliberate falsification\nof his SF 86. His failure to provide a credible explanation for his negative response to the drug\ninquiry casts continuing doubt on his judgment and trustworthiness, and reflects a lack of remorse.\nAccordingly, he has also not satisfied MC \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nTo his credit, Applicant discussed his illegal drug use to October 2004 and his then very\nrecent drunk driving offense with the OPM investigator during an interview of January 12, 2005. It\nis not clear whether the investigator knew of the DUI before Applicant told him about it. Applicant\neven admitted that only his wife knew of his recent arrest as he was embarrassed about it. The\nGuideline E, personal conduct, concerns raised by his knowing falsification of his SF 86 may be\nmitigated by a prompt good faith effort at rectification (see \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts). Assuming Applicant volunteered the DUI, his disclosures some 11 months after his SF\n86 are not considered prompt. Moreover, serious judgment concerns persist because of his failure\nin his Answer to squarely address and candidly admit to the government that he had acted to conceal\nhis drug involvement when he completed his SF 86. Indeed, his spurious excuse, i.e., the October\n\n8\n2004 incident happened after he filed his clearance application, could itself raise security concerns\nunder Guideline E (see \u00b6 17(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative. I am unable to conclude based on the evidence before me that\nApplicant can be counted on to fulfill the fiduciary obligation of candor that must be demanded of\nthose granted access.\nDespite the negative inferences that warrant for his credibility because of his SF 86\nfalsifications and ongoing denial of willful concealment, I accept as valid his claim of abstinence\nfrom illegal drugs since October 2004 with no intent of future involvement. While Applicant\u2019s abuse\nof marijuana was off and on, it was on the order of twice per week as of his decision to forswear any\nfuture involvement in October 2004, so does not fall within MC \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. However, an\nintent to not use drugs in the future, as demonstrated by (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation, is a mitigating condition under \u00b6 26(b). The record is silent as to whether\nApplicant has terminated associations with persons with whom he had used marijuana in the past.\nHis most recent drug use was in the context of socializing with his brother-in-law on weekends, and\nthere is no indication he no longer sees his brother-in-law. Yet, his abstinence of about 26 months\nas of his amended Answer is sufficiently long to prove an ability to refrain from marijuana. When\ncoupled with his outstanding participation in the substance abuse treatment program, I find sufficient\ndemonstration of intent to refrain from future drug use. There has been no evidence of any alcohol\nor drug abuse since he completed 28 group sessions and five individual sessions of substance abuse\ncounseling in May 2005.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana abuse continued after he became employed by a defense contractor and well\nafter its illegality was brought home to him by a criminal arrest. His failure to disclose his drug\ninvolvement in February 2004 is especially troubling given his drug abuse was ongoing (see \u00b6 2(a)(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and \u00b6 2(a)(3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct). While substance abuse counseling brought about sustained abstinence (see \u00b6 2(a)(6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes), his reform is\nincomplete where he refuses to admit that he had concealed his drug use from the government, in\nall likelihood to obtain the clearance needed for his job.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

She has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about\nher finances under Guideline F. Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 19, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On November 17, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA\nrecommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a\nposition of trust should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On November 30, 2006, Applicant\nsubmitted a notarized response to the allegations. She requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on March 7, 2007 and issued a notice of hearing on March\n16, 2007, which the Applicant received on March 20, 2007. I conducted a hearing on April 11, 2007.2\nThe government submitted eight exhibits (GE), which were marked and admitted into the record as\nGE 1-8 without objection. Applicant submitted 18 exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and\nadmitted as App Ex A-R without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. I held the record\nopen for the submission of additional documentation by Applicant. Applicant timely submitted 9\nadditional documents, which were marked and admitted as App Ex S-AA without objection. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations under Guideline F, except\nallegation 1.d, which she denied.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after\n3\na thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings\nof fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated August 19, 2004) at 1, 3, 5; Tr. at 18-19.\n4\nId.\n5\nTr. at 19, 23, 27-28.\n6\nId. at 20-21, 48-51.\n7\nId. at 21-23, 27-28; App Ex F (Husband\u2019s Social Security Benefits Statement, dated August 2, 2006) at 3; App\n8\nEx G (Applicant\u2019s Social Security Benefits Statement, dated September 15, 2006) at 3.\nApp Ex U (Applicant and husband\u2019s Joint Federal Income Tax return for 2002); App Ex V (Applicant\u2019s\n9\nhusband\u2019s Federal Income Tax return for 2003); App Ex W (Applicant\u2019s Federal Income Tax return for 2003); App Ex\nX (Applicant and husband\u2019s Joint Federal Income Tax return for 2004); App Ex Y (Applicant and husband\u2019s Joint\nFederal Income Tax return for 2005); App Ex Z (Applicant and husband\u2019s Joint Federal Income Tax return for 2006).\n3\nApplicant, a 35-year-old woman employed as a customer service associate for a Department\nof Defense contractor, seeks a position of public trust. She began working for her employer in\nDecember 1997.4\nApplicant and her husband married 15 years ago. They have two children, a 10-year-old son\nand a 3-year-old daughter. For the last 10 years, she has worked steadily.5\nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s husband received a promotion to general manager at his company. His\nsalary increased to approximately $60,000 a year plus bonuses. In March 2002, they purchased their\ndream home for approximately $170,000. In the fall of 2002, Applicant miscarried twins after\nsignificant medical treatment. She missed time from work while receiving medical care. Her employer\npaid her about 60 % of her salary during her absence. In December 2002, she and her husband\npurchased a new truck for $26,000, with a monthly payment of $600.6\nOn January 2, 2003, Applicant\u2019s husband reported to work, intending to sign his yearly\nemployment contract. Instead, his company informed him that his job had been eliminated under its\nrestructuring plan to save costs. He received no termination compensation or performance\nrecommendations. Because his employer provided only dates of employment, he encountered\nsignificant difficulties in obtaining a new job. He collected unemployment for six months. Applicant\nand her husband used their income from her job and his unemployment benefits to pay their mortgage,\nutilities and food. They stopped paying their other bills, including the car payment, because they did\nnot have sufficient money. They incurred significant delinquent debt as a result.7\nApplicant\u2019s husband obtained a position selling insurance in late 2003. He earned $6,000 in\n2003 about 1/10 of his former salary. By early 2004, their the new truck has been repossessed and\ntheir home sold. They received enough money from the sale of their home to pay the mortgage debt\nin full. Applicant\u2019s husband secured a better paying job in 2004. In January 2007, he procured another\nposition, which he anticipates will pay him between $35,000 and $40,000.8\nApplicant\u2019s income tax returns for 2002 show a joint income of $72,000. The tax returns for\nshe and her husband for 2003 indicate an income of $28,134 for her and $14,360 for him for a total\nincome of $42,494, a decline of almost $30,000 from the previous year. Their tax returns for 2004,\n2005 and 2006 reflect a joint income of $46,244, $60,394 and $65,175 respectively.9\n\nApp Ex S (Husband\u2019s Earnings statements from January 2007 through March 2007); App Ex T (Applicant\u2019s\n10\nEarnings statements from January 2007 through mid-April 2007); Tr. at 39.

Her\nhusband\u2019s gross monthly income is $1,200 plus commissions. Her net monthly income totals\napproximately $1,732, including overtime, and her husband\u2019s net income at his new job various\ndepending upon commissions earned. For the first three months of 2007, his net monthly income\naveraged $1,362 without any withholding for income taxes. Thus, their net monthly household\nincome is approximately $3,100 plus $50 a month internet reimbursements costs from her employer.10\nCurrently, Applicant and her husband rent a house for $750 a month. They timely pay their\nrent each month. Their other monthly living expenses include $300 for food, $300 for utilities, $305\nfor a car payment, $200 a month for gasoline, $75 for car insurance, $210 for debt payments, $100\nfor clothing, and $120 for miscellaneous expenses. Her minimum monthly expenses total $2,360,\nleaving approximately $800 a month of income available for debt payment. She did not include child\ncare expenses for her daughter.11\nApplicant\u2019s unpaid debt as listed in the SOR totals $18,119. Most of her unpaid debt relates\nto the truck repossession in 2004. The debts listed in allegations 1.d ($2,054) and 1.e ($2,096) are the\nsame. She negotiated a settlement of this debt and began making payments, which will conclude in\nSeptember 2007. The $145 medical bill in allegation 1.a has been paid. Two other small debts listed\nin the SOR (allegations 1.b and 1.f), an unidentified medical bill and a cable bill, totaling less than\n$500 remain unpaid. The debt listed in allegation 1.c belongs to her husband alone, and is no longer\nlisted with an overdue balance on her credit report. Applicant and her husband have slowly paid the\ndebts incurred subsequent to his lay off, as reflected in her credit reports. They decided against filing\nbankruptcy as a way to resolve their debt issues.12\nApplicant\u2019s employer rated her performance at a high meets expectations or exceeds\nexpectations from 1998 through 2004. Her more recent evaluations are lower. The commentary\ncriticizes her unscheduled leave use, which was 30 hours last year. Despite her most recent rating, in\nthe last year she received seven certificates of excellence for her work performance, plus a $1,000\nincentive award in early 2007. Her former supervisor describes her as a person of integrity, who is\ncommitted to her job and is responsible.13\nPOLICIES\n\n Department of the Navy v.

Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n15\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the\n16\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n17\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.18\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n19\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n20\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n21\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect old,\ndelinquent debts, which were incurred subsequent to her husband\u2019s job loss in January 2003. Because\nof this income loss and the delinquent status of her debts, Applicant lacked the ability to pay her debts.\nBased on the evidence of record, the government established the applicability of disqualifying\nconditions (DC) \u00b6 19 (a) inability . . . to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\nBefore January 2003, Applicant and her husband paid their bills. Their income level enabled\nthem to purchase a new home and a new truck in 2002. Her husband lost his job in January 2003,\nwhich created a severe financial hardship for them. Their overall income for 2003 decreased by\n$30,000 making it very difficult for them to pay their bills. Although he eventually secured a job, they\ncontinued to encounter severe financial difficulties because he initially earned about 90% less than his\njob as a general manager. Mitigating conditions (MC) \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances applies. \nApplicant has not met with a financial counselor, but as her husband began to work and obtain\nbetter paying positions, they began to slowly pay their debts or reduce their debt burdens. They sold\ntheir dream home before it went to foreclosure. She contacted some creditors to arrange payment of\nher debts, one at a time. She currently has a payment plan for the second largest debt listed in her SOR.\nMC \u00b6 20 (c) . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and\n\nThe remaining financial considerations mitigating condition set forth in AG 20 (f) does not apply in this case.\n22\n7\nMC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts apply. While she is not required to be debt free, she must manage her income and expenditures\nin a reasonable and prudent manner. Applicant and her husband are doing so.\nApplicant denied owing the debt alleged in paragraph 1.d. of the SOR. This debt is the same\nas the debt identified in allegation 1.e of the SOR. Therefore, MC \u00b6 20 (e) the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue has some applicability.22\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nShe and her husband worked hard, and as a result, steadily increased their income. Because of\ntheir good income, they bought their dream home and months later a new truck, all of which they could\nafford at the time of purchase. At the same time, they timely paid their bills. When her husband lost\nhis well-paying job, they made decisions about which bills could be paid with their significantly\nreduced income. They properly decided to reduce their living expenses by selling their dream home\nand moving to lower cost rental housing. They tried, but could not continue the car payments on the\nnew truck. In the last three years, her husband\u2019s income has slowly increased, in part by his willingness\nto move to better paying jobs as the opportunities arose, but is still well below his salary in 2002.\nDuring this same period of time, they undertook to repay their debts, one at a time. Her most recent\ncredit report reflects the improvement, but not elimination, of her debt problems. She declined to use\nbankruptcy as a means to eliminate her debt. She did not rely on any illegal means to resolve her debt.\nShe chose instead to pay her debt a bit at a time, including debts not listed in the SOR.\nFor more than 9 years, Applicant has been a reliable and well-performing employee. In the last\nyear, she received seven certificates of excellence for her work performance. I have weighed the\nmitigating conditions, Applicant\u2019s attitude towards debt payment, her assumption of responsibility for\nher debts, and her overall character against the remaining unpaid debts. I find that the overwhelming\nweight of the evidence indicates that she is a person of integrity, who is trustworthy. She would not\nact in a manner which would harm her employer or the government. There is little likelihood she\nwould violate the privacy rights she has agreed to protect because of her existing debt problems,\nparticularly since she did not violate these rights when her finances were at their worst. I conclude she\nhas mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-g:\n     For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

He deliberately\nfalsified answers on a security clearance application.  He has a pattern of criminal conduct, most\nrecently a DWI conviction.  He also has a history of drug involvement.  He failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns about personal conduct, criminal conduct, and drug involvement.  Clearance is\ndenied.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated June 5, 2004).\n1\nTr.  at 6.\n2\nId. at 25.\n3\nId. at 24.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 5, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on\nDecember 1, 2005, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive\n5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nBecause the SOR was issued prior to September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that the case proceed\nunder the former guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 3, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 7, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on March 5, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 20, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nApplicant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of the 15-day notice rule.   The government offered\n2\nthree exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-3, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant offered\nno exhibits.  I kept the record open until March 27, 2007, to allow the government the time to file\nadditional documents.  The government filed Exhibit 4 on March 20, 2007, and it was admitted\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR.   He admitted additional SOR\n3\nsubparagraphs 2.f. through 2.i., that alleged a 2004 charge of marijuana possession which was nolle\nprosequi, and a DWI in August 2006, for which he was convicted..  At the hearing, these allegations\nwere admitted without objection.   The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After\n4\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,\nI make the following additional findings of fact: \n\nId. at 13, 15.\n5\nId. at 14.\n6\nId. at 26-27.\n7\nId. at 14, 48.\n8\nId. at 15-16.\n9\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 6.\n10\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 7.\n11\n4\nApplicant is a 26-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor.   He is single\n5\nand has no children.   He voluntarily participated in the Job Corps.   He is a high school graduate and\n6\n7\nwas scheduled to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology network security in June\n2007.   He has no prior military service and he made his first security clearance application on June\n8\n5, 2004.9\nPersonal Conduct\nWhen Applicant executed his  security clearance application (Standard Form 86), on June\n5, 2004, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \n24. Your Police Record  - Alcohol/Drug Offenses  For this item, report information\nregardless of whether the record in your case has been  \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken\nfrom the court record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain\nconvictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued\nan expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a73607.\nHave you ever been charged with or convicted any offense related to alcohol or\ndrugs?10\nHe failed to disclose that on January 29, 2003, he was charged with (1) possession of marijuana, and\n(2) DWI/drugs and alcohol.  He answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question:\n26. Your police record - other offenses  For this item, report information regardless\nof whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the\ncourt record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions\nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an\nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a73607.  In the\nlast 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted on any offense(s)\nnot listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?  (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150\nunless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)  Have you ever been charged with\nor convicted of any felony offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?   \n11\nBecause the offense was properly under question 24, he was not required to list it here.  He answered\nthis question:\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 7.\n12\nTr. at 28.\n13\nAmendment to SOR, dated March 19, 2007.\n14\n5\n27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity -Illegal Use of Drugs  Since the\nage of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?  \nHe answered \u201cYes\u201d and listed marijuana use on February 1, 2002, but failed to disclose that he also\nused marijuana in January 2003.  \n12\nApplicant stated he did not include the arrests because he believed he could answer \u201cNo\u201d as\nhe had not been convicted.  The 1998 shoplifting charge was handled in juvenile court, he received\na suspended imposition of sentence (SIS), so there is no conviction, nor is there an adult record of\nthis case.  He did  not ask anyone to help him interpret the questions.13\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant was arrested in October 1998 and charged with shoplifting.  He entered a plea of\nguilty and was placed on probation for six months.  In November 1999, he was charged with a\nprobation violation.  On February 9, 2000, he was again charged with a probation violation.\nProbation was continued.  As stated earlier, this was a juvenile court matter, and is not a conviction\nas it was an SIS.\nApplicant was arrested January 29, 2003, and charged with (1) possession of marijuana, and\n(2) the DWI/drugs and alcohol.  The charges were nolle prosequi.\nApplicant was arrested December 21, 2004 and charged with possession of marijuana.  The\ncharge was nolle prosequi.\nOn August 11, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI/1st.  On November 2,\n2006, he was charged with failure to appear on a misdemeanor charge, and a bench warrant was\nissued.  On December 7, 2006, he was found guilty of the DWI, sentenced to 30 days in jail,\nsuspended, and fined $300.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 12 months.   I assume that the\n14\nfailure to appear charge must have been dismissed.  \nFor failing to truthfully answer questions 24, 26, and 27 on the SF 86, the government alleges\nthree violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001.\nDrug Involvement\n\nTr. at 25.\n15\nId. at 36.\n16\nId. at 37.\n17\nId. at 37-42.\n18\n6\nApplicant used marijuana in February 2002 and January 2003.   He claimed he did not care\n15\nfor it but smoked it once or twice more \u201cto relax.\u201d   Even after the second and third time, he did not\n16\nlike it.  But he used it \u201cout of curiosity and was still curious.\u201d   The charges pertaining to the two\n17\narrests in 2003 and 2004 for possession of marijuana were dismissed, but he admitted using\nmarijuana at or about the time of the arrest.18\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n19\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n20\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n7\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses\n19\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.20\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct \n\n8\nConduct involving questionable judgment, unreliability, lack of candor, or dishonesty could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).  The\noperative word is \u201cdeliberate.\u201d  The questions were unambiguous.  They clearly asked if a person\nhad ever been \u201ccharged\u201d with a crime.  He completed his SF 86 on June 5, 2004.  No mitigating\nconditions apply.  His conduct is recent and significant.  I find his omissions are not the result of a\nfaulty memory, but were done in an attempt to mislead the government.  I conclude Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nCriminal Conduct  \nThe government established its case under Guideline J.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged) and E2.A10.1.2.2. (A single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses) apply.  Applicant admitted the shoplifting, probation violations, possession of\nmarijuana, and DWI.  I also conclude that his false answers on his SF 86 about his offenses was\nmaterial and violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001.\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (The criminal behavior was\nnot recent), E2.A10.1.3.3. (The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in that person's life), E2.A10.1.3.4. (The person did not voluntarily\ncommit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur), and E2.A10.1.3.5.\n(Acquittal) do not apply.  This DWI  was committed in 2006.  He has a pattern of illegal drug use.\nAnd I am not convinced he will not use marijuana again.  His 2004, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 violations are\nparticularly important because they pertain to the core of security clearance determinations -\nfalsifications relating to a security matter.\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions E2.A10.1.3.2. (The crime was an isolated incident)\ndoes not apply, nor does CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).\nHe has a history of arrests over the past nine years.  Even though he had three charges dropped, he\nadmitted the underlying criminal conduct of smoking marijuana.  He produced no evidence of\nrehabilitation.  I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.\nDrug Involvement\n\nE2.A8.1.1.3. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\n21\nmedical direction.\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n22\nId.\n23\nId.\n24\n9\nThe government established its case under Guideline H.  Drug Involvement Disqualifying\nCondition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (Any drug abuse)  is applicable, because Applicant admitted\n21\nmultiple uses of marijuana.\nDrug Involvement Mitigating Condition E2.A8.1.3.2. (The drug involvement was an isolated\nor aberrational event) does not apply because his use followed a pattern over a two year period.\nDrug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC)  E2.A8.1.3.1. (The drug involvement was\nnot recent), E2.A8.1.3.3. (A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future), and\nE2.A8.1.3.4. (Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis\nby a credentialed medical professional) do not apply.  Applicant has not used marijuana since\nDecember 2004.  His answer about his continued use of marijuana even though he didn\u2019t like it.  He\nsaid he did it out of curiosity, and that he was \u201cstill curious.\u201d  His statements about ending his\nmarijuana use are not pursuasive.  I conclude Guideline H against Applicant. \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable, reliable\n22\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the disqualifying and\n23\nmitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk\nand vulnerability in protecting our national interests.  \n24\nApplicant falsified two questions on his SF 86.  This is problematic because candor with the\ngovernment about a person\u2019s negatives is important in a security clearance determination.  If a person\ndiscloses the adverse information about himself, he may be more likely to put the governments\u2019s\ninterests ahead of his own to protect classified information.  If he is still curious about the effects of\nsmoking marijuana, he is more likely to use drugs in the future.  His attempt to explain his false\nanswers was evasive, and he never provided a clear explanation of why he answered falsely when the\nword\u201d charged\u201d is easy to understand.  For these reasons, the totality of the record raises reasonable\nand persistent doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests\nand secrets.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n10\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

The Applicant does not have a\npattern of criminal conduct.  The two incidents were isolated in nature and the evidence shows that\nthere is little to no chance that they will recur.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 14, 2005, and requested that\nhis case be decided without a hearing.  Subsequently, on April 12, 2006, the Applicant requested to\nhave a hearing.  The case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge on May 1, 2006.\nThe case was reassigned to the undersigned on July 6, 2006, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on\nAugust 22, 2006.\nA hearing was held on September 13, 2006, at which the Government presented three\ndocumentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 3).  Testimony was taken from the Applicant,\nwho called one additional witness, and also submitted two hearing exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nA and B) and one post-hearing exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  The transcript was received on\nSeptember 25, 2006. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 46, single and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance previously granted in connection\nwith his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer\nto the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\nThe record shows that the Applicant was arrested in 1992 on a charge of battery.\n(Government Exhibit 2.)  The Applicant does not deny this arrest.  He credibly testified that he had\nno clear memory of the incident which resulted in the charge, nor could he remember the disposition\nof the charge.  The Applicant further testified that he had contacted the city where the arrest took\nplace to find out more information.  However, based on the age of the incident, none could be found.\nThe city police department forwarded documents to the Applicant that would enable him to have the\nrecord, if any, expunged.  (Transcript at 32-34, 46-48; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  There is no evidence\nas to the ultimate disposition of this charge.\n\n3\nThe Applicant was involved in a physical altercation with his then 18 year old son in March\n2004.  According to the Applicant, his son attacked him with a baseball bat and the Applicant had\nto defend himself.  The police were called and the Applicant was arrested for Domestic Violence\nAssault.  He plead guilty to an amended charge of Disorderly Conduct and was sentenced to a\nsuspended jail term, two years of probation, a fine, ordered to attend an anger management course\nand to have no contact with his son for 180 days.  (Transcript at 34-36.)  The Applicant successfully\ncompleted the anger management course in July 2004.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 4.)\nPrior to this incident, the Applicant had a Protective Order issued concerning his son in 2003.\nPart of the reasoning behind obtaining this order was because his son had threatened the Applicant\nwith a baseball bat.  (Transcript at 36, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The Applicant\u2019s son has left that\nhouse and now has a better relationship with the Applicant.\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant submits that the two incidents described above are the only ones in his record.\nHe is an honorably retired member of the US Air Force.\nDocumentary evidence was submitted by the Applicant showing that his state of residence\nhas granted his partner approval to run a day care center at the Applicant\u2019s house.  This approval was\ngranted in 2006, after the date of the Domestic Violence arrest.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 5-6.)\nWritten statements from superiors and co-workers were submitted by the Applicant.  He is\ndescribed as \u201creliable, diligent and extremely professional\u201d by a senior military officer.  (Appellant\u2019s\nExhibit C at 8-9.)  Testimony from a co-worker, and the other statements contain similar statements.\n(Appellant\u2019s Exhibit C at 10-19.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na.\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n\n4\nb.\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\nc.\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.\nThe voluntariness of participation\nf.\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\ng.\nThe motivation for the conduct\nh.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in criminal acts that demonstrate poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\n\n5\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has two criminal arrests on his record, in 1992 and 2004.  Disqualifying Condition\nE2.A10.1.2.2. applies to this case, \u201cA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The two\nincidents were separated by 12 years.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has a pattern of\nengaging in violent behavior.  The second incident in particular, involving his son, is isolated in\nnature and there is little or no possibility that the conduct will be repeated.  Under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, it is appropriate to apply Mitigating Condition E2.A10.1.3.2., \u201cThe crime\nwas an isolated incident.\u201d  In addition, specifically regarding the second incident, Mitigating\nConditions E2.A10.1.3.3., \u201cThe person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in that person\u2019s life\u201d; and E2.A10.1.3.4., \u201cThe person did not\nvoluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur\u201d also\napply.\nThe Applicant has successfully attended an anger management course and the evidence\nshows him to have internalized the teachings.  (Transcript at 56-59.)  He has support from co-\nworkers and superiors and the record shows him to be a very worthwhile and respected employee.\nMitigating Condition E2.A10.1.3.6. applies as, \u201cThere is clear evidence of substantial rehabilitation.\u201d\nIn addition, application of the General Factors and the whole person concept is appropriate\nand supports a decision in the Applicant's favor.  The Applicant is motivated not to engage in similar\ncriminal conduct in the future (factor g.), he shows considerable evidence of rehabilitation (factor\nf.), and, under the particular circumstances of this case, the probability that the Applicant will engage\nin such conduct again are virtually nil (factor i.). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

Applicant elected to have his case decided based on the written\nrecord.  On October 31, 2006, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Administrative Judge\nerroneously concluded that the government\u2019s concerns about Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol\nhad been mitigated.

We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is\nrational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority\ndelegated to the agency. . .\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law\nde novo.\nOn appeal, Department Counsel asserts that the Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant has mitigated security concerns about his alcohol consumption is arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  \nMore specifically, Department Counsel contends: (i) the Judge failed to properly consider\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing alcohol use; (ii) the Judge improperly gave undue weight to the fact that\n\nAt one point in his \u201cConclusions\u201d section, the Judge states: \u201cAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol\n5\nabuse, is counterbalanced by his strong desire to avoid judicial intervention, confinement, fines and loss of his driver\u2019s\nlicense.\u201d This case was brought under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), not Guideline J (Criminal Involvement).\nThe government\u2019s primary concern is Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol, not how many alcohol-related incidents he might\nincur in the future.  To conclude, therefore, that Applicant\u2019s desire, however strong, to avoid judicial intervention, etc.\nin the future counterbalances his history of alcohol abuse, where that abuse is ongoing, is to engage in an arbitrary and\ncapricious analysis.  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in 2000 and there was no evidence of recent family or\npolice problems related to alcohol; (iii) there is no record evidence supporting the conclusion that\nApplicant has \u201csignificantly\u201d decreased his alcohol consumption since the 1990's; (iv) there is no\ncredible evidence that Applicant has made any significant changes in lifestyle; and (v) the Judge\nconsidered the record evidence in a piecemeal fashion.  All of these contentions are persuasive.\nThe Administrative Judge found that Applicant currently consumes alcohol to the point of\nintoxication on weekends and drives after consuming alcohol, and that both of these facts were\n\u201cindications of an ongoing problem.\u201d The Judge then concluded that Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nconsumption was mitigated because of the lack of recency of the police involvements relating to\nalcohol, the lack of evidence that alcohol use has recently caused him problems with his family, a\nchange in life circumstances in that Applicant has significantly reduced his alcohol consumption\nfrom the 1990's, and Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he will not drive after consuming enough\nalcohol to become intoxicated.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption is no\nlonger of security concern is not sustainable in light of his finding that Applicant still drinks to\nintoxication, drives after consuming alcohol, and has an ongoing problem.  On the facts of this case,\nwhich also include Applicant\u2019s attendance at a 30-day inpatient alcohol treatment program in the\n1990's, the mitigating circumstances cited by the Judge are not of sufficient magnitude to undercut\nthe overriding concern of Applicant\u2019s current, open-ended abuse of alcohol.  \nIn terms of mitigation, the Judge gives inordinate weight to the facts that Applicant has had\nno incidents with the police since 2000 and there is no evidence that his alcohol use has recently\naffected his family life.  The mere fact that Applicant has avoided alcohol-related incidents for a\nrecent period, while entitled to some weight, does little to mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns in the face of the totality of Applicant\u2019s history and the evidence of continuing alcohol\nabuse.  In his analysis of matters of mitigation, the Judge\u2019s emphasis on the lack of recent alcohol-\nrelated incidents is arbitrary and capricious because it focuses on the absence of a symptom or result\nof Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems (i.e., alcohol-related incidents) and ignores the record evidence of\nsecurity significance (i.e., Applicant\u2019s continued drinking to intoxication).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n02-11454 at 4 (App. Bd. June 7, 2004).  \n5\nThere are additional problems with the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis.  The Judge concluded\nthere is some evidence about reduction of factors that led to earlier alcohol-related incidents and\nfacts supporting a change in Applicant\u2019s life circumstances.  However, the Judge does not\nspecifically identify what these reductions or changes are.  Also, the Judge did not make factual\nfindings relating to a reduction of factors leading to alcohol-related incidents or changes in his life\ncircumstances.  Similarly, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has \u201csignificantly reduced his\nalcohol consumption from the 1990's\u201d is not reasonably supported by the record evidence.  The\nJudge made no findings concerning the level or frequency of Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol during the\n1990's, and there is no objective record evidence of same.  The record evidence contains statements\n\n5\nby Applicant where he indicates that he drinks less now than he did in the 1990's.  The Applicant\u2019s\nstatements are record evidence that the Judge was entitled to consider and accord some weight.\nHowever, in this case, Applicant\u2019s statements are vague, lack specificity, and there is no objective\nrecord evidence of Applicant\u2019s drinking patterns during the 1990's which would serve to (a)\ncorroborate his claim of a reduction in drinking, and (b) provide a basis for the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat any reduction in drinking was \u201csignificant.\u201d  Moreover, even if the Board were to sustain the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had significantly reduced his drinking in recent years, it would\nhave limited value in terms of mitigation in light of the record evidence that Applicant still drinks\nto intoxication on a regular basis.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision leads the Board to conclude that the Judge failed to consider\nthe totality of Applicant\u2019s overall history of problems with alcohol and failed to analyze matters in\nmitigation in the context of that overall history.  Thus, there is merit to Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument that the Judge considered the evidence in a piecemeal fashion.           \n \n     \nOrder\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nCONCURRING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES E. MOODY\nI agree with my colleagues in their resolution of this appeal.  I note first of all that this case\nwas decided on the written record, which diminishes the degree of deference which the Board\nextends to the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  See ISCR Case 04-04302 at  (App. Bd. Jun. 30,\n2005) (\u201c[W]hen an applicant waives a hearing and chooses to have his or her case decided by a\nJudge based on a written record, the Judge has no ability to make a credibility determination based\non observation of the applicant\u2019s demeanor.  Accordingly, a credibility determination based solely\non a written record is not entitled to the same deference on appeal as a credibility determination\nbased on observation of a witness\u2019s demeanor.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 97-0752 at 3 (App. Bd.\nDec. 4, 1998); ISCR Case No. 97-0625 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 1998).  Additionally, by choosing\n\n6\nsuch a forum, Applicant deprived himself of the opportunity to submit to questioning, which would\nenable him to provide more detailed explanations for the problematic aspects of the record.\n These aspects are not de minimis.  Applicant, who has consumed alcohol since he was\nthirteen years old, received inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in the mid 1990s.  Since completing\nthe program, he has continued to drink, has been convicted of DUI and reckless endangerment (his\nchildren were in the car with him on that occasion), and admits that he still drinks and drives.  These\nmatters raise serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgement, reliability, and self control.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A7.1.1.  In my view, the evidence which Applicant submitted in response to the SOR\nand to the FORM is not sufficient to overcome the  \u201cstrong presumption against granting a security\nclearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).\nth\nApplicant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion that it is \u201c\u201cclearly consistent with the interests\nof national security\u201d to grant him a clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Clearance is denied.\n\nI denied Department Counsel\u2019s motion to admit Exhibit 5.\n1\nExhibit 3, FBI Identification Record, dated May 24, 2004, at 2; Tr. 57.\n2\nId; Tr. 58.\n3\nTr. 53.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). Applicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2006, and\nrequested a hearing.\nThe case was originally assigned to another administrative judge, and scheduled for\nNovember 16, 2006. Applicant failed to appear at the hearing, and later requested a continuance,\nwhich was granted on December 16, 2006. Two days later, the case was assigned to me. I issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 2, 2007, scheduling it for March 22, 2007. The hearing was held as\nscheduled. During the hearing, I received four government exhibits,  and the testimony of one\n1\ngovernment witness, and one Applicant witness. DOHA received the transcript on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 47-year-old married man with one adult child and two adult stepchildren. He\nis a trucker who has hauled munitions for the armed forces over the years.\nIn 1979, Applicant was arrested and charged with grand larceny.  He was convicted and\n2\nsentenced to serve one to ten years confinement. After serving ten months, he was paroled. In March\n1981, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary.  The charge was later dismissed. In\n3\nFebruary 2003, he was arrested and charged with domestic battery and possession of a controlled\nsubstance. As part of a plea bargain, the prosecution dropped the domestic battery charge, and\nApplicant pleaded guilty to the drug charge, and was fined $100.00.4\n\nTr. 30 - Testimony of Defense Security Services (DSS) Investigator.\n5\nTr. 39 - Testimony of DSS Agent.\n6\nId.\n7\nTr. 47.\n8\nTr. 54.\n9\nTr. 53.\n10\n3\nOver the years, Applicant has abused several drugs including \u201cuppers,\u201d \u201cdowners,\u201d and\nmarijuana. He began abusing them as a teenager in the mid-1970s. Although he stopped using uppers\nand downers in the late 1970s, he continued using marijuana until 2003.  \n5\nIn February 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86). He failed\nto disclose relevant, material information, as required, about his past drug use, arrests, and personal\nfinances. The following month, he met with a DSS agent. Under oath, he admitted falsifying the SF\n86, explaining that he did not want to lose his job.  Also, he told her that he abused marijuana in\n6\ntremendous quantities, smoking up to ten joints per day, and that he had spent approximately\n$100,000 on marijuana during his lifetime.  \n7\nAt the hearing, Applicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He testified that his wife\ncompleted it incorrectly, and that he signed it without reviewing it.  He also stated he did not recall\n8\ntelling the agent that he had spent $100,000 on marijuana over the years,  and contended that the\n9\nestimation of his marijuana use provided to the agent was inaccurate because\u201cat the time I gave [the\nagent] my statement, I really didn\u2019t care whether I got a clearance or not.\u201d10\nAfter Department Counsel completed cross-examination of Applicant, Applicant rested his\ncase, and walked out of the hearing before its completion.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible rules of law.\nInstead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in\nconjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2.,\nEnclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching impartial,\ncommon sense decisions.\n\nSee Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n11\n4\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement\nwith drugs, raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or\nability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence\nmay impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of\nan unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  the government is responsible for presenting evidence to\n11\nestablish facts in the SOR that have been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the\ngovernment, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant\u2019s extensive history of drug abuse triggers the applicability of Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug abuse), and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2 (Illegal\ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).\n\nIn the last 7 years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production,\n12\ntransfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for your own\nintended profit or that of another?\n5\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Although his use of\n\u201cuppers\u201d and \u201cdowners\u201d no longer poses a security concern because of the length of time since the\nlast time he abused them, he just stopped using marijuana less than three years ago. Given the\ntremendous volume of marijuana he used, and the length of time he smoked it, it is too soon to\nconclude that he has mitigated the security clearance concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s omission of information regarding his drug use, arrests, and finances from his\n2004 SF 86 raises the issue of whether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC)\nE2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. No\nevidence was presented that Applicant ever purchased or sold marijuana for his profit or as part of\na wider criminal enterprise. PC DC 2 is inapplicable to Question 29.12\nWith respect to Questions 21, 24, 27, 36, 38, and 39 of the security clearance application, PC\nDC 2 applies without mitigation. During the hearing, Applicant provided testimony that either\nminimized his earlier statement to the investigator, shifted the blame for the omissions to his wife,\nor contradicted his earlier statement entirely. These omissions constitute a deliberate falsification.\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s lifetime of criminal conduct triggers the application of Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses). His criminal conduct has continued nearly uninterrupted from\n1976 when he first used marijuana, to 2004, when he falsified the SF 86. In light of the extensive\nnature of his criminality, I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nGiven the extent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana abuse, his SF 86 falsifications, his lack of\ncredibility displayed at the hearing, and the disrespect for the security clearance process that he\ndemonstrated by walking out of the hearing, significant concerns remain with respect to his security\nclearance worthiness.

Because the SOR was issued prior to\nSeptember 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case proceed under the former guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 7, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on February 16, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 5, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.  The government offered one exhibit, marked as Exhibit 1.  Applicant offered  no exhibits.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all allegations in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant, a 64-year-old consultant,  is employed by a federal contractor.   He is married with\n2\ntwo grown children.   He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology, and is about 50% complete towards\n3\nearning a master\u2019s degree, also in sociology.   He served in the United States Marine Corps from\n4\n1960 to 1964, and received an honorable discharge.   He held a security clearance while a Marine,\n5\nand later held a clearance for 20 years working as a federal law enforcement agent.  The current\napplication is for a new security clearance.6\nSubparagraph 1.b. of the SOR alleged that Applicant was suspended from employment with\na federal agency, on February 26, 1996, for disclosing confidential information.  It also alleged that\nhe  voluntarily retired following this suspension.  The internal affairs office of the agency\n\nId. at 19-22.\n7\nId. at 24.\n8\nId. at 26.\n9\nId. at 33-34.\n10\nId. at 26-30.\n11\nId. at 38.\n12\nId. at 30.\n13\n4\ninterviewed him and suggested that he not talk to anyone about the investigation.  Applicant called\nX to see if she knew anything about an investigation.  X indicated she had heard of an investigation,\nbut revealed no other information..   Applicant revealed nothing to her about his involvement with\n7\nit.  At this time, Applicant did not know that X was also a subject in the investigation.  Applicant\nlearned that Y made allegations about Applicant and X disclosing confidential information,\nfollowing X\u2019s promotion over Y. Several people later apologized to Applicant for their role in the\ninvestigation.  Later, Y was investigated, suspended, and possibly fired.   \n8\nThe agency never gave Applicant the specifications of the charges against him and never\nsuspended him.   A second allegation involved his alleged revealing or uncovering or giving\n9\ninformation to someone he didn\u2019t even know.  The agency dismissed this charge.  His employer\nplanned to transfer him to another area of the country, to a dangerous assignment where other agents\nhad been killed.  Because he was 55, he and his wife decided it would be better for him to retire.10\nSubparagraph 1.a. of the SOR alleged that Applicant re-signed as Chief of Internal Affairs,\nin a municipality\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, on February 21, 2003, following an internal\ninvestigation.  Allegations arose in 2001, hat he had harassed and threatened a coworker by leaving\na note with a bullet on top of it.  He had worked with the coworker for about six months, and had\nactual contact with her four or five times in that period of time during a Medicaid fraud\ninvestigation.  Because she was a bookkeeper, she helped Applicant retrieve financial information\nto assist with his investigations.  He accepted employment with another agency within the city.  On\nhis last day on this job,  he unloaded his weapon at home, took a bullet out, and put it in his pocket.\nAt work, he turned in his weapon, ammunition, badge and other such items.  He supervisor  then told\nhe had to go back to his office and retrieve some documents.  Another investigator accompanied him.\nHe wanted to leave a token of appreciation to the bookkeeper for her cooperation, in hopes that she\nwould cooperate with him in his new job.  He wrote her a note, put his name on it, put the bullet on\ntop of the note and left.   Her supervisor made a big deal out of it.  The coworker made no\n11\nallegations against Applicant.   The agency never allowed Applicant to read the report against him.\n12\nHe was told it was null and void, and that they wouldn\u2019t pursue it.  \n13\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n14\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported\nby substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d\nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n15\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light\nof pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under\n5\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\n14\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.15\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n16\n \nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light\nof pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.16\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination\nof further processing for clearance eligibility:\nThe government argued that Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC)\nE2.A5.1.2.1. (Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers,\nneighbors, and other acquaintances), and (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.4. (Personal conduct or concealment\nof information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such\nas engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail) apply in this case.  \nWhen an allegation involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations is controverted, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  Applicant denied the allegation.  With respect to the 1996 employment investigation,\nthe government produced no evidence of such charges, suspension, or disciplinary action against\nApplicant of any kind.  He did not retire as a result of the investigation, but retired because he was\nasked to transfer to a dangerous assignment, with the chances of getting killed realistic.  I find no\nevidence that Applicant disclosed any confidential information.  His job as a federal agent was\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n17\nId.\n18\nId.\n19\n7\nextremely hazardous, and one in which disclosure of confidential information could often prove\nfatal.  The government failed to make its case, and I conclude SOR subparagraph 1.b. for Applicant.\nThe government also failed to provide evidence which supports its case under SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a.  The only credible evidence was supplied by Applicant, and there was no\nsuspension, and Applicant did not leave employment with the city as a result of the investigation\nabout the note to the bookkeeper.  The bookkeeper\u2019s supervisor initiated an investigation.  The\nbookkeeper saw nothing improper in Applicant\u2019s note.  Nothing came of the investigation.  His\ntestimony is insufficient to establish the government\u2019s case, because he did not resign his position,\nbut transferred to another job before the allegations were made.  He retired two years after the\nincident happened.  I find SOR subparagraph 1.a. for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life\nto make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d17\n\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to\n18\nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his\n19\nage (64), his education which includes partial completion of a masters degree, his service in the\nMarine Corps, and his 20 years service as a federal law enforcement agent under some hazardous\nconditions.\nI observed Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I find his\ntestimony to be believable and find him to be a sincere and credible witness, because he answered\nquestions directly, completely, and honestly.  The totality of the record raises no reasonable or\npersistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS \n\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 (Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application) is dated\n1\nand signed M arch 8, 2004.\nOn August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum\n2\ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (D oD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case.\nApplicant had a history of alcohol abuse. She did not have any alcohol-related\nincidents involving civil authorities. She self-referred for alcohol counseling and\ntreatment. She received outpatient alcohol treatment. Following a relapse, she\nimmediately self-referred for treatment. She regularly attends Alcoholics\nAnonymous meetings and does not consume any alcohol. She is committed to a life\nof sobriety and has demonstrated a lifestyle change consistent with that commitment.\nHer alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 8, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF\n86).  On February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as\namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).\nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on April 6, 2007, and received at DOHA on April 10,\n2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case\ndecided at a hearing. On April 30, 2007,  the case was assigned to me. On May 21,\n2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for June 27, 2007. On\nJuly 10, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.).  \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nAs to the concerns identified under Guideline G, Applicant admitted with\nexplanation the SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.  \n\nGE 1, supra n. 1, is the basis for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated. \n3\nApplicant is 55 years old.\nShe received a bachelor of science degree in\n3 \norganization management in June 1995.  Tr. 140-141. She also received a master\u2019s\ndegree in January 2002 in organizational management.  Tr. 141. She has no military\nservice. Applicant has been employed by a government contractor since January\n2004, and her current job title is quality assurance manager.  Tr. 142. She is\nunmarried, and does not have any children. Applicant was married from September\n1980 to April 2000.  That marriage ended by divorce.  Applicant is a first-time\napplicant for a security clearance.\nThroughout her hearing, I found Applicant to be credible and forthright. She\nconfirmed her previous admissions and provided substantial information about her\nhistory with alcohol and her life as an alcoholic and what she has done overcome her\ndisease. In the late 1980s, Applicant experienced several emotional setbacks that\ntriggered an impulse or a need to self-medicate and use alcohol to excess.  Her\ndrinking became exacerbated following the pending breakup of her marriage when\nshe and her husband separated in June 1996; loss of family members to include her\nstepfather in September 1987, her father-in-law in December 1987, her grandmother\nin July 1988, and her mother in July 1989; relocating to live near her husband\u2019s large\nfamily in December 1990, which resulted in friction with her husband; losing her\nhome in 1998; and being laid off from her job. \nThe loss of her home, being laid off, and her final divorce decree all occurred\nwith a one-week period. She self-referred to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) when she\nrealized her drinking was getting out of hand.  She attended two outpatient alcohol\ntreatment programs in 1999. The first was from January 1998 to May 1999 and the\nsecond was from June 1999 to July 1999. In both programs, she was diagnosed as\nalcohol dependent. All of her alcohol-related treatment was as the result of self-\nreferral.  \nFrom August 1999 to September 1999, she attended counseling with a licensed\nclinical social worker for alcohol dependence and depression. From October 1999 to\nJune 2004, she attended counseling on an occasional basis with a licensed social\nworker for alcohol abuse. In conjunction with her response to DOHA interrogatories,\nshe provided a letter from a psychologist, who is also a licensed independent clinical\nsocial worker. The letter stated among other things that Applicant \u201cplans to continue\nworking with her AA sponsor and to attend AA meetings regularly, approximately\none a week.\u201d She described Applicant\u2019s prognosis as \u201cgood, contingent upon\ncontinued treatment. She recommended Applicant for a security clearance and \u201c[did]\nnot believe her past behavior would cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness,\ngood professional judgment, or ability to safeguard classified national security\ninformation or material.\u201d GE 4.    \nShe admits to having a relapse in August 2006 where she drank a six pack of\nbeer over a two-day period and to drinking two beers on December 25, 2006. She\ndenied seeing a medical doctor for diagnosed condition as alleged in \u00b6 1.e. She\ndenied continuing to consume alcohol as alleged in \u00b6 1.f, but rather to drinking two\n\nbeers on Christmas Day. She denied as of August 2006 to drinking alcohol once\nevery six months, but rather to drinking one six pack of beer in August 2006 over a\ntwo-day period. The government did not rebut her assertions.  \n  She has three AA sponsors, and maintains contact with them.  One lives out\nof state and the other two live near her. Her AA attendance is current, and she has\nnot consumed alcohol since December 2006. Her current treatment program consists\nof attending AA meeting and maintaining contact with her sponsors, and lists her\nprognosis as good. \nApplicant submitted numerous reference letters that confirm she is a solid\nemployee, is professionally accomplished, has a superb reputation, maintains a\nstrong and very engaged support group, is a homeowner and has outside interests.\nGE 4, AE A through JJ. Numerous individuals stated Applicant is trustworthy and\nrecommended her for a security clearance. None of these documents contained any\nderogatory information. Applicant is determined never to use alcohol again. She is\nreliable and trustworthy and is highly motivated to remain sober. \nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge\nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access\nto Classified Information\u201d (Guidelines), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these\nGuidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nGuidelines \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an\nadministrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\u201d\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as\n4\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than\nthe weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the\nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d\nConsolo v.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d\n375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\n5\nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions\nof the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nthe final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial\nevidence.\u201d  The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to\n4\nestablish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access\nto classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of\na disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and\nprove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\nclearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to\nthe Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a\nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty\nhours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able\nto repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants\naccess to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions\nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\nGuidelines \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning alcohol\nconsumption, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nThree \nAlcohol \nConsumption \ndisqualifying \nconditions \ncould \nraise \na\ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 22(c),\n22(e) and 22(f) provide:  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\nApplicant did not have any \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work\u201d or at work.\nApplicant was not diagnosed as alcohol dependent by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional as defined by the Directive. No court orders were issued. Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6\n22(a), 22(b), 22(d), and 22(g) do not apply.  \nApplicant was straightforward in her responses and accepted responsibility for\nher actions. She was diagnosed as alcohol dependent at two separate alcohol\ntreatment centers in 1999. She admitted to binge drinking during her hearing and\nalthough she had lengthy periods of sobriety, she had several relapses, most recently\nin December 2006. After her relapses, she always self-referred for help.The\nGovernment produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying conditions,\nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment.6\nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-\n(d) are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173\n7\nat 4 (App. Bd. M ay 26, 2004)). W hen making a recency analysis all debts are considered as a whole.\n  \nThese two mitigating conditions receive additional support in the whole person analysis portion\n8\nof this decision, infra.\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment\nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress;\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nGuidelines \u00b6 20(a) does not define the sufficiency of the passage of time, and\nthere is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. Based on\nmy evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,  and because Applicant routinely,\n7\non multiple occasions consumed excessive amounts of alcohol within two years of\nhis hearing, I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20(a) with regard to the passage of time does\nnot apply. She does receive partial credit under this Guideline after her binge\ndrinking when confronted with the loss of a family member, loss of her job, and\nhaving her divorce become final all within the same week. Guidelines \u00b6 20(c) does\nnot apply because Applicant had a relapse. \nHowever, she meets all requirements of Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) because\nshe has acknowledged her alcoholism, has changed her life, has abstained from\nalcohol use since December 2006, has successfully completed inpatient and\noutpatient treatment, has attended hundreds of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and\nreceived a favorable prognosis from her psychologist. Applicant presented a strong\ncase for concluding that alcohol consumption problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d   \n8\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have\nconsidered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Guidelines \u00b6 2(a).  As noted above, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption was of\nsufficient frequency, volume and duration to constitute a security concern. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of three disqualifying\nconditions. Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption is a serious, ongoing, long-\nterm problem. Her alcohol-abuse relapse after out-patient alcohol therapy is\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n9\nsufficiently serious to raise a security concern. Her alcohol consumption was\nknowledgeable and voluntary. She is 55 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully\nresponsible for his conduct. The motivation to consume alcohol was connected to\ndepression and stress relief. Excessive alcohol consumption in this manner is not\nprudent or responsible, and as such, the potential for exploitation is raised.   \nApplicant has presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence. She\nsuccessfully completed out-patient alcohol treatment in 1999.  She attended\nhundreds of Alcoholic Anonymous meetings and had numerous sessions with clinical\npsychologists, who had decades of experience treating alcoholism. A psychologist\nprovided a prognosis supporting sobriety and rehabilitation. She received extensive\nalcohol counseling and has religious and AA support. The absence of evidence of\nany prior violation of her employer\u2019s rules or requirements, her forthright and candid\nstatement at her hearing, her solid performance as an employee and his evident\nsincerity about making future progress all weigh in her favor. \nThere was no evidence of any alcohol-related violations of the law, or\nimpairment at work. She provided compelling oral and written statements from\nfriends and co-workers supportive of rehabilitation. In sum, the likelihood of\nrecurrence is low because sufficient evidence was presented about improvement in\nher overall psychological and emotional situation, her solid track of sobriety, and\nalcohol counseling.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption.   \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9\nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the\nGuidelines. Applicant has successfully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s\ncase. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for access to classified\ninformation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 21, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 4, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1 (\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,\n1\ndaughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to\nbe exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States\u201d).\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.4 (\u201cThe individual has promptly reported to proper authorities all requests, contacts, or\n2\nthreats from persons or organizations from a foreign country as required\u201d).\n2\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC) 1  and 4  is arbitrary and\n1\n2\ncapricious and unsupported by the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis unsustainable because the whole-person considerations relied upon are unsupported by the record\nevidence and their application is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant a security clearance.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nFacts:\nThe Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is an\nAmerican citizen by birth.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC),\nwho has applied for U.S. citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law suffered under the Cultural Revolution.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a retired university professor and dean of a teachers\u2019 college.\nDiscussion:\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not challenged on appeal.     \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law\nde novo.\n\nIn footnote 4 of the Judge\u2019s decision, there is a discussion of an Appeal Board decision where the Board\n3\naffirmed a Judge\u2019s decision in part based on testimony that the Applicant in that case had repeatedly told his wife in blunt\nand graphic terms he would not compromise national security even if her relatives were harmed by the PRC.  There is\nno comparable evidence in this case.  Thus, it is not clear what purpose was served by the Judge\u2019s discussion of the prior\ncase. \n3\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of FIMC 1 and 4 is\narbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the record evidence.  With regard to FIMC 1 in\nparticular, Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  When the government has established that\nsecurity concerns have been raised, as is the case here with regard to Applicant\u2019s in-laws, the burden\nshifts to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 99-0532\nat 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000).  The Judge points out that Applicant has a heavy burden to satisfy\nFIMC 1.  The Judge states that \u201cthere is nothing in the evidence establishing whether or not\nApplicant\u2019s relatives in the PRC are/may be/might be/could be agents of the PRC government, or\nare in a position to be used, voluntarily or not, knowingly or not, to seek to persuade Applicant to\nact against U.S. security interests.\u201d  Decision at 6.  The Judge goes on to say that the security risk\nposed by the presence of Applicant\u2019s in-laws in the PRC is \u201chypothetical.\u201d  Applicant has not met\nhis burden to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised in this case.  Even if we accept\nthat Applicant\u2019s in-laws in the PRC are not agents of a foreign power, their vulnerability to\nexploitation or coercion has not been mitigated.  Indeed, they were mistreated during the Cultural\nRevolution.  The Judge improperly shifted the burden to the government to prove that the risk exists.\nThe record does not support the Judge\u2019s application of FIMC 1.3\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument regarding the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of FIMC\n4 has less merit.  Applicant testified that he properly notified the appropriate officials of his marriage\nto a foreign national and his visits to the PRC.  There is no allegation or evidence to the contrary.\nHowever, in light of the evidence as a whole and in light of the error identified with regard to FIMC\n1, the Judge\u2019s application of FIMC 4 by itself would not overcome the security concerns raised by\nApplicant\u2019s foreign in-laws.  In this case, the facts identified by the Judge in applying FIMC 4 do\nnot readily suggest refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and they have low probative value in light\nof the security concerns identified in this case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01820 at 4 (App. Bd.\nDec. 14, 2006).     \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause the whole-person considerations relied upon are unsupported by the record evidence and\ntheir application is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  While we agree with Department\nCounsel\u2019s argument as a whole, we disagree with Department Counsel\u2019s contention that the factors\nlisted in E2.2.2.1 of the Directive are the only ones that may be considered in performing a whole-\nperson analysis in a Guideline B case.  Other factors in an applicant\u2019s life are relevant in a whole-\nperson analysis.  While the Judge properly notes Applicant\u2019s maturity, integrity, and service to his\ncountry, he does not explain why these characteristics outweigh the security concerns raised by the\npresence of Applicant\u2019s in-laws in the PRC.  While Applicant stated that he would not act contrary\nto the interests of the U.S., the Board has previously held that such statements are of limited weight,\ngiven their hypothetical nature.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12435 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2007).\nThe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is not sustainable. \n\n4\nOrder\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 23, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered\nthe SOR on February 5, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 7, 2007, with a request pending from the government\nthat the administrative judge take notice of certain facts pertaining to Nigeria. The government\nsubmitted five documents in support of its request. On March 14, 2007, counsel for Applicant\nentered his appearance. On March 20, 2007, I gave Applicant until April 20, 2007, to file his\nresponse to the government\u2019s request for administrative notice. On April 20, 2007, Applicant filed\nhis objections and proposed alternative facts for administrative notice. On April 26, 2007, the\ngovernment was given until May 4, 2007, to respond to Applicant\u2019s request for administrative notice.\nThe government entered various objections on May 4, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on May 8, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Four government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-4) and 11 Applicant exhibits (A-K) were admitted, and testimony was taken from Applicant,\nhis spouse, and the facility security officer at his workplace.  A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was\nreceived on May 17, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nBoth parties have requested that I take administrative notice of several facts concerning\nNigeria. Authority to consider the requests is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and\nevidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner.). The DOHA\nAppeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader\nthan judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No. 02-24875 (decided Oct.\n12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative judge who took\n\nThe official publications of the U.S. government are viewed as more authoritative than web published reports\n1\nof news agencies. The facts for administrative notice accepted by a DOHA colleague do not represent the official position\nof DOHA. They were considered to the extent they could be substantiated by source documents before me for review.\n3\nadministrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document was an official\nU.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was provided in advance\nto the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present alternative information for\nthe judge to notice.\nFacts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized\nsource and relevant and material to the case before me. The government relies on a Congressional\nResearch Service publication, CRS Report for Congress: Nigeria in Political Transition, dated July\n28, 2006, and four official U.S. State Department publications: Background Note: Nigeria, dated\nSeptember 2006; Consular Information Sheet, Nigeria, dated January 13, 2006; Travel Warning:\nNigeria, dated January 17, 2007; and Nigeria, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2005,\ndated March 8, 2006. Applicant submitted a decision on remand of a DOHA administrative judge\nin ISCR Case No. 05-03635, dated January 16, 2007; the U.S. State Department\u2019s Background Note:\nNigeria of September 2006; a White House press release dated March 29, 2006; three Internet news\nreports of the British Broadcasting Company; and one Online NewsHour Update of the Public\nBroadcasting Company. After reviewing and weighing the reliability of the source documentation\nprovided by the parties,  I took administrative notice of certain facts as set forth below.\n1\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, that Applicant exercised dual\ncitizenship with the U.S. and Nigeria (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that as a U.S. naturalized citizen he acquired a\nNigerian passport in September 2002 (\u00b6 1.c) which was valid as of a July 2006 interview (\u00b6 1.b), and\nhe used that passport to travel to Nigeria in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006. Also alleged were Foreign\nInfluence (Guideline B) concerns about the Nigerian citizenship and residency of his mother (\u00b6 2.a)\nand siblings (\u00b6 2.b), the Nigerian citizenship of his mother-in-law, who was residing with him in the\nU.S. (\u00b6 2.c), and his travel to Nigeria in 1997, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006 (\u00b6 2.d).\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he exercises dual citizenship with the U.S. and\nNigeria, and that while he renewed and held a Nigerian passport as alleged, he had destroyed the\npassport and did not intend to reacquire one. He also admitted he had traveled to Nigeria as alleged\nto visit his family, and had used his Nigerian passport for the convenience of not having to travel to\nanother state to obtain a visa. Applicant also admitted the Nigerian residency and/or citizenship of\nfamily members, but added that his mother-in-law has permanent U.S. residency. He explained he\ntraveled to Nigeria in 1997 to get married, in 2002 to serve as a groomsman at a friend\u2019s wedding,\nin 2003 on his father\u2019s death, and in 2005 and 2006 to visit his ailing mother.\n Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review and\nconsideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take administrative\nnotice, I make the following relevant and material additional findings:\n\n4\nApplicant is a 43-year-old senior systems engineer, who has worked for his current employer\nsince June 2000. He was granted a secret-level security clearance in December 1996 while serving\non active duty in the United States Army. \nApplicant was born in southwestern Nigeria in 1963. His father worked as a security guard\nand as a tutor in an elementary school. He also got involved in subsistence farming to care for his\nfamily. Applicant\u2019s mother had a stall outside of their home from which she sold  produce to the\nlocal populace that she had bought from a wholesaler.  They raised their eight children in Nigeria.\nApplicant has lived continuously in the United States since June 1989. He came to the U.S.\non a tourist visa and met his first wife, a U.S. citizen, at a club. They married in December 1989, but\ndivorced four years later. \nApplicant worked as a security officer at a local university for about two years. In 1991, he\nbegan English studies at another university in the area while working as a loss prevention agent in\nthe retail sector. Struggling with a calculus class, he decided to join the U.S. military after he learned\nfrom a recently discharged veteran how his service for the U.S. had affected him.\nOn May 28, 1993, Applicant entered on active duty in the U.S. Army at the rank of private\n(E1). In November 1993, he married his second wife, who was also a native of Nigeria. Three years\ninto his four-year enlistment term, he was promoted to sergeant (E5) and selected for the position\nof supply sergeant in a new missile command. With his ability to perform his duties limited because\nof his lack of security clearance, the U.S. Army filed an application for U.S. citizenship on his behalf\nin June or July 1996. In October 1996, he took the oath of U.S. naturalization, vowing to renounce\nall foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms\nor perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. After he was\ngranted a secret-level clearance in early December 1996. He fulfilled his duties as a supply sergeant\nwith distinction, and in late February 1997, he was awarded an Army Commendation Medal, signed\noff by the post\u2019s commanding officer, a major general.\nApplicant traveled to Nigeria to see his family members from March 23, 1997 to June 15,\n1997. He obtained a visa so that he could travel on his U.S. passport, which was issued on October\n25, 1996. Applicant was discharged from active duty in May 1997 at the completion of his\nenlistment term, and he returned to his civilian job as a loss prevention agent with a department\nstore.\nApplicant and his second wife divorced in November 1997. They had been separated since\n1995. In mid-December 1997, Applicant traveled to Nigeria on his U.S. passport for his wedding to\nhis third wife. As required, he obtained a visa authorizing a single trip of 60 days duration on his\nU.S. passport. Applicant had met his spouse that previous Spring when he visited his eldest sister\nat work. His spouse was a nursing student there. They married in January 1998, and she emigrated\nto the U.S. in March 1998.\nOver the 1998/99 time frame, he worked as a co-op engineer for a defense contractor and\npursued undergraduate studies at the state university while continuing to work in loss prevention.\nOn earning his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering, he pursued his master\u2019s degree\n\n5\nafter starting with his present employer in June 2000 as an entry-level electrical engineer I. In this\nprofessional position, he served as a technician testing antenna components and design amplifiers.\nIn 2002, he was promoted to a systems engineer II position.\nOn or about August 22, 2002, Applicant went to Nigeria to serve as a groomsman at a\nfriend\u2019s wedding. While in Nigeria, he applied for a Nigerian passport that was issued on September\n5, 2002, and valid to September 4, 2007, for the convenience of future travel to Nigeria to visit\nfamily members. He would not have to travel to the Nigerian Consulate in New York to obtain the\nvisa needed to enter Nigeria on his U.S. passport. Applicant presented both his U.S. and Nigerian\npassports when he departed Nigeria on September 6, 2002, although only the Nigerian passport was\nstamped by the border control officer. His U.S. passport was stamped in transit at the airport in\nAmsterdam. Applicant took a pleasure trip to the Netherlands from mid-July 2003 to mid-August\n2003. He entered and exited the country on his U.S. passport.\nApplicant went to Nigeria from November 21, 2003 to December 2, 2003, for his father\u2019s\nfuneral services. He traveled with both his Nigerian and U.S. passports. His Nigerian passport was\nstamped on entry and his U.S. passport on his departure from Nigeria.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse became a naturalized U.S. citizen on February 14, 2004. On September\n23, 2004, she was issued a U.S. passport that is valid to September 2014.\nAt work Applicant continued to progress in responsibilities. In 2003, his workstation was at\na hardware facility in a closed area. He assumed a lead position in data analysis in a test planning\ngroup in 2004. On June 10, 2004, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86). He\ndisclosed that he and his spouse were dual citizens of Nigeria. In response to question 16 concerning\nforeign travel, Applicant listed pleasure trips to Nigeria from March to June 1997, from August to\nSeptember 2002, and from November 2003 to December 2003, and to the United Kingdom in late\nMay 2000 for 12 days and the Netherlands in July 2003 for one month. He did not include his trip\nto Nigeria for his wedding in answer to question 16, but indicated he married his spouse in Nigeria\nin January 1998. Applicant disclosed that he had a Nigerian passport valid to September 4, 2007.\nApplicant also reported the Nigerian citizenship and residency of his mother, but that his mother-in-\nlaw, also a Nigerian citizen, was living with his family in the U.S.\nOn November 11, 2004, Applicant was interviewed about his foreign connections by a\nspecial investigator for the federal Office of Personnel Management Investigations Service.\nApplicant executed an affidavit explaining that he holds dual citizenship with Nigeria and the U.S.\nbecause it never crossed his mind to renounce it. He denied maintaining Nigerian citizenship to\nprotect a financial interest. He admitted he had voted in Nigeria, but that it was before he became\na U.S. citizen. While he understood he had rights, privileges, and obligations because of his Nigerian\ncitizenship, he did not see that he had to meet any of those obligations. Applicant expressed his\nwillingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship \u201cif necessary as a condition of access.\u201d\nApplicant traveled to Nigeria in 2005 and 2006 to see his ill mother. He took both his\nNigerian and U.S. passports. The Nigerian passport was stamped on entry both times, on July 8,\n2005, and on May 25, 2006, and on exit from Nigeria on June 22, 2006. His U.S. passport was\nstamped on his departure from Nigeria on July 26, 2005. Applicant reported all his foreign travel to\nhis employer as he had been trained to do in the U.S. Army, even when it was not required. On April\n\nApplicant testified his children are citizens solely of the U.S. (Tr. 46). No evidence was presented of the\n2\ncitizenship laws of Nigeria, so it cannot be determined whether or not they are also derivative citizens of Nigeria based\non descent (birth to Nigerian citizens). Applicant has not taken any action to acquire Nigerian citizenship for them or\nto exercise their Nigerian citizenship if they are citizens.  \n6\n21, 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse was issued a Nigerian passport valid for five years. She traveled to\nNigeria within the week with both her U.S. and Nigerian passports, and both were stamped by border\ncontrol on April 28, 2006. She had not returned home since she emigrated, not traveling even for her\nfather\u2019s funeral, and she went to see his resting place.\nOn January 23, 2007, DOHA notified the Applicant in the SOR that his possession of a\nforeign passport raised concerns of foreign preference. He had not been previously advised that\nholding a foreign passport was inconsistent with his security responsibilities. On February 5, 2007,\nApplicant went to the plant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) and she shredded his Nigerian passport.\nBefore it was destroyed, the FSO made a copy of the cover, of the identification page, and of page\n32 containing three stamps from Nigerian immigration authorities dated November 21, 2003, July\n8, 2005, and June 22, 2006.\nOn or about March 7, 2007, Applicant telephoned the Nigerian Embassy and inquired about\nthe process to renounce his Nigerian citizenship. On the advice of embassy personnel, Applicant\nnotified the Nigerian Embassy by letter of March 15, 2007, of his intent to renounce his Nigerian\ncitizenship and of his destruction of his Nigerian passport. The Embassy received the documents on\nMarch 19, 2007. On March 19, 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse surrendered her Nigerian passport to the\nNigerian Embassy with a letter serving to formally notify the Nigerian authorities of her intent to\nrenounce her Nigerian citizenship. As of May 8, 2007, neither Applicant nor his spouse had received\nany confirmation that Nigerian officials had accepted their requests to renounce. He was led to\nunderstand that a letter of intent to renounce sent with the Nigerian passport was all that was\nrequired.\nOn April 17, 2007, Applicant was issued his U.S. passport on renewal. The passport is valid\nto April 16, 2017. He has no intent to reacquire a Nigerian passport. He and his spouse intend to\nreside permanently in the U.S.. Their four children (an eight-year-old, a six-year-old, and three-year-\nold fraternal twins) were born in the U.S.,  and have never been to Nigeria. Applicant and his spouse\n2\nown their home, and have savings and assets in 401(k) accounts in the U.S. Applicant is also vested\nin a retirement plan with his employer. They have no foreign assets. Applicant has voted in every\nnational election in the U.S. since he became a citizen. He has not voted in a Nigerian election since\nhe acquired U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s spouse is a registered nurse at a nearby hospital.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, a Nigerian resident citizen as of May 2007, still had the produce stall\noutside of her home, but she was no longer actively involved in the buying and selling of produce.\nShe visited Applicant in the U.S. when his first son was born in 1999.\nApplicant\u2019s older brother is a lawyer employed as a deputy director and head of the legal\nservices division, a legal advisory department of the government agency tasked with oversight of\nsecurities markets in Nigeria. His job location was recently changed to the head office in Nigeria\u2019s\ncapital. This brother came to the U.S. in 1995 for training. Applicant understands that his brother\nworks primarily on training issues but that he also drafts policy on trade in securities, provides advice\n\n7\nas to complaints of fraud and advantage, and monitors compliance by Nigerian companies.\nApplicant\u2019s younger brother is a resident citizen of the Netherlands. He is employed in a factory\nbuilding engines. Applicant has another brother who works as a security officer in a hospital in\nEngland.\nApplicant\u2019s three sisters are resident citizens of Nigeria. His oldest sister is the chief nursing\nofficer at a government-run university teaching hospital. She started there as a pupil midwife in\nAugust 1977 and rose through the ranks to her present position in January 2006. She is divorced\nfrom a physician in private practice. The middle sister is principal of a \u201cjunior secondary\u201d public\nschool in Nigeria. She started as a teacher with the school district in November 1982, and she is\nmarried to a botanist employed by a research company. Applicant\u2019s youngest sister has been the chief\nnursing officer at a local government-owned hospital since January 2003, having started as a staff\nnurse in October 1979. Since May 2001, she has secondary duties as an instructor in the state school\nof nursing under the ministry of health. She is married to a remodeling contractor. Applicant\u2019s sisters\nreside near his mother in Nigeria.\nNone of Applicant\u2019s siblings have served in the Nigerian military. His siblings have standard\nbenefit packages commensurate with their respective career positions, which in the case of his eldest\nsister includes housing and transportation allowances in addition to retirement.\nWith young children, his studies, and working about 65 hours weekly for the defense\ncontractor, Applicant has little free time to contact his relatives in Nigeria. He has telephone contact\nprimarily with his mother, whom he telephones once quarterly to check on her well being. Applicant\nsends his mother money about $200 or $300 around Christmas or New Year\u2019s as a gift. She lives in\nthe home that was inherited by her eldest son on her husband\u2019s death. The other half of the house\nis rented and she lives off the income from the tenancy. Applicant\u2019s contact with his siblings is\nlimited to Christmas and at New Year\u2019s. His siblings are aware he is an electrical engineer. Only his\nattorney brother knows of his employer. None of his siblings know he has access to classified\nmaterial in his job or his specific job duties. Applicant does not expect to inherit any asset in Nigeria,\nas the first born son traditionally gets everything. Applicant respects what the U.S. stands for, and\nhe denies he would do anything to jeopardize the security and defense of the U.S. even if his\nrelatives were threatened (\u201cI cannot choose my family over America   . . .  People die to protect\nfreedom that I enjoy, and I was willing to be one of those.\u201d).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law has lived with Applicant and his spouse for about four years. She\nhad been a trader in Nigeria. She has permanent residency status in the U.S. and intends to pursue\nU.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible. Applicant\u2019s wife has three sisters (one older and two\nyounger) and a younger brother, all resident citizens of Nigeria. The eldest sister is a trader of\nclothing and cosmetics. The middle sister is a nurse who is currently unemployed after the recent\nbirth of a child. She is married to a lawyer in private practice concentrating on labor issues. The\nyoungest of the sisters is an administrative assistant in a college of agriculture. She is married to a\nproperty manager for a major bank in Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a student. His spouse\nsends her brother $100 two or three times per year for his expenses (food, clothing). Applicant has\ncontact with his spouse\u2019s sisters about once a year at New Year\u2019s. She is in contact with her siblings\ntwo or three times a year by telephone. They have never visited her in the U.S.\n\nThe State Department recently reported in a Background Note: Nigeria, dated June 2007, that presidential and\n3\nlegislative elections were held in Nigeria on April 21, 2007, and that President Obasanjo stepped down on May 29, 2007.\nThe current president is Musu Umaru Yar'adua, a moderate and a respected governor from the northern state of Katsina,\nwho pledged publicly to make electoral reform, peace and security in the Niger Delta, and continued electoral reform\nhis top priorities. \n8\nApplicant has a stepbrother who is a U.S. resident citizen. Applicant sponsored his\nimmigration.\nApplicant\u2019s work performance has consistently been rated as \u201cexceeds requirements.\u201d\nManagement has found him to be an \u201cextremely hardworking, dedicated, and driven employee with\ngreat capacity for taking on multiple tasks.\u201d As a systems engineer II in 2005, Applicant handled\nclassified information daily while on temporary duty conducting and analyzing flight tests. In about\n2006, Applicant was promoted to senior systems engineer I. As of May 2007, Applicant is a control\naccount manager for his employer, responsible for managing a program budget of more than $26\nmillion as well as the schedule. He has about seven direct reports with whom he has daily contact.\nApplicant is also required to meet with the customer once a month and these meetings are sometimes\nclassified. Applicant works in a controlled access area secured by lock and entry logs. He has never\nviolated security regulations.\nApplicant has continued his educational endeavors during his employment for the defense\nfirm. Five graduate courses away from earning his master\u2019s in electrical engineering, Applicant\nstarted a program toward a master\u2019s degree in engineering management. He expects to graduate from\nthat program in summer 2008.\n  \nNigeria is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations. The\nmost populous nation in Africa, Nigeria has experienced periods of political instability, with conflict\nalong ethnic and geographic lines and dominated by military coups, since gaining its independence\nfrom Britain in 1960. Following sixteen years of military rule, Nigeria transitioned in May 1999 to\na civilian, democratic form of government, led by President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was still in\noffice as of May 8, 2007.  Soon after his election, President Obasanjo retired hundreds of military\n3\nofficers who held political positions and established a blue-ribbon panel to investigate human rights\nviolations. As of the end of 2005, Nigeria continued to have a poor human rights record and\ngovernment officials at all levels continued to commit serious abuses. Yet, the U.S. State Department\nalso reports that most civil society leaders and most Nigerians have seen a marked improvement in\nhuman rights and democratic practice under the Obasanjo-led government.\nNigeria continues to experience localized civil unrest and communal (inter ethnic) violence.\nIn the oil-producing region of the Niger River Delta, resident U.S. citizens and other foreigners have\nfrequently been threatened and held hostage during labor disputes. Due to a significant deterioration\nin the security situation in that region over the past year, and because of crime throughout the\ncountry, the U.S. State Department in January 2007 warned U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to\nand within Nigeria.\nSince it gained independence, Nigerian foreign policy has been focused on Africa and the\ngoals of African unity and independence, peaceful settlement of disputes, nonalignment and non\nintentional interference in the internal affairs of other nations, and regional economic cooperation\n\n9\nand development. Over the past decade, Nigeria has played a pivotal role in support of peace in\nAfrica, providing the bulk of the troops for UN peacekeeping efforts in the region.\nThe U.S.-Nigerian bilateral relationship has continued to improve since the inauguration of\nthe Obasanjo-led government. The U.S. is Nigeria\u2019s largest trading partner after the United\nKingdom. Nigeria lent strong diplomatic support to U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the aftermath\nof the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, condemning the attacks and supporting military action\nagainst the Taliban and Al Qaida. Nigeria has been a leader in forging an antiterrorism consensus\namong states in Sub-Saharan Africa. President Obasanjo maintained good relations with the Clinton\nand Bush administrations. The respective leaders have received each other several times since 1999.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). A native of Nigeria, Applicant came to the\nU.S. in 1989. In 1993, he enlisted in the U.S. Army where he served with distinction. With the help\nof the military, he became a U.S. citizen in October 1996. In December 1997, he returned to Nigeria\nto marry his current wife, entering on his U.S. passport. In 2002, he again went to the Nigerian\nConsulate and obtained a visa so that he could travel to Nigeria on his U.S. passport. During that trip\nto Nigeria in September 2002, Applicant renewed his Nigerian passport for ease of entry to Nigeria.\nHe traveled to Nigeria in 2003, 2005, and 2006, presenting both his U.S. and Nigerian passports.\n\nAs of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant had a valid Nigerian passport that was scheduled to expire on\n4\nSeptember 4, 2007.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held it reasonable for the administrative judge to consider the significance not\n5\nonly of an applicant\u2019s ties, but also of his spouse\u2019s ties to a foreign country, and the possible effect they may have on\nApplicant\u2019s contacts under Guideline B (see ISCR Case No. 01-02452, App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002). \n10\nAlthough for convenience and not intended as an act in preference for Nigeria, his voluntary\nacquisition of a Nigerian passport in 2002 is the exercise of a privilege of his Nigerian citizenship\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen, and it raises foreign preference concerns under AG \u00b6 10 (a)(1)(exercise\nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport).4\n \nOn February 5, 2007, after receiving the SOR, Applicant consulted with his employer\u2019s FSO,\nwho shredded the passport in his presence. Mitigating condition \u00b6 11(e)(the passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies. Any\nconcerns that the DoD may have had of Applicant reapplying for that foreign passport have been\namply addressed by his letter of March 15, 2007, to the Nigerian Embassy, expressing his intent to\nrevoke his Nigerian citizenship. Willingness to renounce dual citizenship is mitigating under \u00b6\n11(b)(the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship). While there is no\nevidence as of May 2007 that his citizenship has been officially revoked, Applicant has done what\nhe can to comply with DoD requirements. His destruction of his foreign passport is consistent with\nhis U.S. citizenship and telling of his preference for the U.S.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6\n6). It is undisputed that Applicant has foreign connections that present a potential risk of divided\nloyalties. Applicant\u2019s mother, siblings, and his spouse\u2019s siblings are resident citizens of Nigeria.  His\n5\nmother-in-law, a U.S. permanent resident with Nigerian citizenship, has lived with him and his\nspouse for the past four years. The salient issue is whether these foreign contacts present a\nheightened risk (see \u00b6 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion, and \u00b6 7(d)\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion). The nature\nand strength of the family ties, the country involved, and the occupations, activities, and/or\nassociations of the foreign family members are all relevant in assessing whether there is a heightened\nrisk.\n\n11\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is subject to Nigerian laws and obligations because of\nher Nigerian citizenship, she enjoys the protections of her U.S. legal residency and she does not\nintend to return to Nigeria. Concerning the family members within the physical reach of the Nigerian\nauthorities, Applicant speaks with his mother by telephone quarterly, and with his siblings even less\n(about twice yearly). Despite the relatively infrequent contact, it is evident he feels some affection\nor familial bond to them. He sends his mother monetary gifts, primarily over the Christmas/New\nYear\u2019s holidays, and visited his mother and siblings when in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria on his\nfather\u2019s death, and out of concern for his mother\u2019s health in 2005 and 2006. Two or three times\nyearly, Applicant\u2019s spouse telephones her siblings and she sends her brother $100 with that same\nfrequency. The nature and extent of their contacts with relatives in Nigeria are what one might\nreasonably expect of any immigrants with parents or siblings living in a distant country.\nHis siblings\u2019 government employments create a somewhat heightened risk, although there\nis nothing about their professions that suggests military, security, or intelligence responsibilities. His\nsisters who are nurses have reached the pinnacles of their careers in Nigeria. Both chief nursing\nofficers, the elder is affiliated with a government-run university teaching hospital, the other is on the\nstaff of the state school of nursing under the Ministry of Health. His elder brother is a lawyer\npresently serving as a deputy director in the main office of the Nigerian agency with oversight over\nsecurities markets. Yet, given the friendly relations between Nigeria and the U.S. since Nigeria\u2019s\ntransition to civilian rule in 1999, Applicant is not likely to find himself in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of his siblings in Nigeria and the U.S. (see \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the\nrelationships with the foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). Despite some ongoing human rights\nabuses and persistent ethnic conflicts in some regions, there has been significant improvement in\nhuman rights since Nigeria transitioned to civilian rule in 1999. Nigeria is not known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information or to sponsor terrorism. To the contrary, Nigeria lent strong\ndiplomatic support to U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001,\nterrorist attacks, condemning the attacks and supporting military action against the Taliban and Al\nQaida. Nigeria has also been a leader in forging an antiterrorism consensus among states in Sub-\nSaharan Africa. To the extent that Al Qaida has publicly expressed interest in overthrowing the\ngovernment of Nigeria, Nigeria is a target, as is the U.S., of such terrorism and not a state-sponsor\nof terrorism. The U.S. is Nigeria\u2019s second largest trading partner, and Nigeria is not likely to\njeopardize these interests by pressuring its law-abiding citizens.\nIn the event that Applicant found himself in a position of being forced to choose between the\ninterests of his family members in Nigeria and the interests of the U.S., Applicant has persuaded me\nthat he can be expected to resolve those interests in favor of the U.S. where he and his spouse have\nchosen to pursue their careers and raise their children. Applicant came to the U.S. as a tourist in\n1989, but married a U.S. citizen only six months later. When the relationship soured, Applicant did\nnot rejoin his family in Nigeria. Instead, he joined the U.S. Army, taking an oath to defend this\ncountry when he was not yet a U.S. citizen. It gave him a sense of belonging and  the opportunity\nto gain U.S. citizenship, a source of pride and joy for  him (Tr. 106). Having progressed from private\n(E1) to sergeant (E5), he left the Army at the end of his four-year enlistment to pursue his education\nand then a career in the defense sector while raising a family. Largely because of these opportunities,\nhe has a strong sense of loyalty to the U.S., as shown by his testimony:\n\n12\nMy loyalty, my choice will always remain that of the United States, Your Honor,\nbecause of what this country stands for. I am here today because of the freedom, the\ndue process, the rule of law. This wasn\u2019t in any other country. I\u2019ll get a letter in the\nmail saying your clearance is cancelled. It brings tears to my eyes, Your Honor,\nbecause this is the only country in the world. I came here with nothing. And I\u2019ve been\nin this country, I pay my taxes, I\u2019ve done everything a citizen ought to do. And I\nrespect what this country stands for. My children are here today as a first-generation\nAmerican, and I see myself as the immigrants who came here through Ellis Island or\nthrough the Mayflower or through whatever means.\nI\u2019m the first person and I thank God for what this country made me become. I grew\nup here. I learned the ways. I went to school here. And I would absolutely never take\nsecurity and the defense of this country lightly. It is far greater than any individual.\nIt\u2019s greater than my parents. It\u2019s greater than my children. I put my life, Your Honor,\nfor four years on the line to defend this country, what it stand [sic] for. (Tr. 107-08)\nApplicant continues to feel a sense of pride in contributing to the national defense through his work\nwith the defense contractor. (Tr. 110) He and his spouse have established firm roots in the U.S., even\nbringing her mother from Nigeria to live permanently in the U.S. Their financial assets (home,\nsavings, retirement assets, job income) are all in the U.S.  Neither Applicant nor his spouse has any\nintent to return to Nigeria permanently, as evidenced by their surrender/destruction of their Nigerian\npassports and notification to Nigerian officials of their intent to renounce Nigerian citizenship.\nApplicant testified convincingly to having made the choice to become a U.S. citizen, to live and die\nhere (\u201cI tell my wife, if I die tomorrow, bury me here because I want the flag draped over my\ncoffin.\u201d). Applicant satisfies MC \u00b6 8(b)(there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest).\nWhole Person Concept\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a)).\nApplicant\u2019s voluntary exercise of his Nigerian citizenship after he had acquired U.S. citizenship\nwould ordinarily raise very serious concern about whether he can be counted on to serve U.S.\ninterests (\u00b6 2(a)(1), the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct). However, his motive was for\nconvenience, to avoid the hassles of obtaining a visa for travel to Nigeria on his U.S. passport (\u00b6\n2(a)(7), the motivation for the conduct) and not intended as an act of foreign preference, and he has\ndemonstrated reform in complying with DoD requirements to surrender, destroy, or otherwise\ninvalidate his Nigerian passport (\u00b6 2(a)(6), the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes). He has significant ties to Nigeria in the close bonds shared with his\nmother and four siblings, but these are overwhelmed by his strong ties to the U.S. established since\n1989 (continuous residency, citizenship, military service, financial assets, education, dedicated work\nfor a defense contractor). He has shown he can be counted on to fulfill his fiduciary obligations to\nthe United States, having handled classified information appropriately in the performance of his\nduties.\n\n13\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

His mother is a dual citizen\nof the U.S. and Taiwan.  He has two brothers, both of whom are U.S. citizens.  One brother works\nin South Korea, the other in Taiwan.

Determination\nof Trustworthiness is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care System Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered into a Memorandum of\nAgreement which gave DOHA the responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for\ncontractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation\n5200.2R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987.\nOn December 29, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness,\nsuitability, and eligibility for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position (ADP-\nI/II/III).\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 10, 2007, and elected to have his case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's\nwritten case (FORM) on or about February 20, 2007. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on or\nabout March 26, 2007. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 31 years of age. He and his wife, a dual citizen of the United States and Taiwan,\nhave resided in South Korea since 2004. They moved to South Korea so applicant could work on a\nUnited States government contract. When the contract ends, they intend to return to the United\nStates.\nApplicant was born in South Korea. It is not clear when, but at some point he moved to the\nUnited States. He became a United States citizen in 1999.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the United States and Taiwan. She is recently\nwidowed and lives with applicant, who supports her, in South Korea. She will move back to the\nUnited States with applicant and his wife.\nApplicant\u2019s older brother is a United States citizen residing and working in South Korea.\nAccording to applicant, he too is working on a government contract, and when it ends, he will return\nto the United States.

ISCR Case No. 01-03120  (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).\n3\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan.\nApplicant has traveled to Taiwan on at least eight occasions since moving to South Korea\nin 2004. His most recent trip was in July 2006. In his response to the SOR, he stated he travels to\nTaiwan to visit his brother and his spouse\u2019s family.\nIn his response to the FORM, applicant stated he is \u201ca loyal American citizen who would\nnever compromise sensitive information to anyone.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant\u2019s (1) mother and spouse are citizens of Taiwan\ncurrently residing in South Korea with applicant, (2)  mother-in-law, father-in-law, two sisters-in-\nlaw, and two brothers-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan, (3) older brother resides in South\nKorea, and (4) other brother resides in Taiwan. The evidence further establishes that since moving\nto South Korea in 2004, applicant has made at least eight trips to Taiwan to visit his brother and his\nspouse\u2019s family. Applicant\u2019s contacts with these family members, particularly when he travels to\nTaiwan, create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation. Accordingly, Disqualifying Conditions 7.a\n(contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion), and 7.i (conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the\nindividual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government,\nor country) are applicable.\nThe foreign influence concerns raised by the foreign citizenship and/or residency of an\napplicant's family member may be mitigated when it can be determined that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the United States\u201d (Mitigation Condition 8.a). Applicant has the\nburden to produce evidence sufficient to make this determination. He did not meet his burden.\nEven if it is assumed he mitigated the concerns raised by his immediate family members (i.e.,\nmother, spouse, brothers), applicant failed to mitigate the concerns raised by his in-laws,  and thus\n1\ndoes not qualify for Mitigating Condition 8.a, because (1) he presented no information about the\nnature of the relationships he has with them, (2) Taiwan, although an ally of the United States, is an\nactive collector of United States technology secrets, and (3) he presented no information about the\npositions and activities of his in-laws. \nI have considered applicant\u2019s statement that he is \u201ca loyal American who would never\ncompromise sensitive information to anyone.\u201d This may very well be a sincere statement. However,\nwithout the information discussed above, and without other information that would enable me to\ndetermine, among other things, (1) when exactly applicant came to the United States, (2) if he has\n\nPages 18-19.\n2\n4\nany current long-standing, close relationships with anyone in the United States, (3) whether he has\nany close relatives currently living in the United States, and (4) whether he currently has any assets\nin the United States, I cannot make the required affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position.\nBased on the foregoing, and after consideration of the factors set forth in Enclosure 2,\nParagraph 2 of the Directive.  of Guideline B is found against applicant.\n2\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability and\neligibility for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Brisbin, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 15, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested\n\n2\na hearing.  On August 22, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the record supports the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant violated his company\u2019s policies and later failed to take responsibility for\nhis actions; whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E was not\nmitigated was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and whether the Judge failed to properly apply\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant alleges that there was insufficient record evidence for the Judge to conclude that\nthe government had established its case with regard to the first of two SOR allegations under\nGuideline E, to wit: that reliable unfavorable information provided by a former employer created a\nsecurity concern.  That information consisted of Applicant\u2019s involuntary termination from his\nposition as a bell captain at a hotel for violating company policy regarding the making and\ndistribution of a room key, and for failing to take responsibility for his actions once hotel\nmanagement began investigating the matter.  Applicant does not dispute the fact that he was\nterminated from his hotel employment.  He does assert that the Judge erroneously leaped to the\nconclusion that, because Applicant had been terminated, he must have actually engaged in the\nconduct underlying the termination.  In support of this assertion, Applicant states that other than\ndouble and triple hearsay statements contained in two documentary exhibits introduced by\nDepartment Counsel, there is nothing in the record to support the conclusion the Applicant actually\nengaged in the underlying conduct.  Applicant insists that his consistent denials of the alleged\nconduct over three years, coupled with his hearing testimony, overwhelmingly outweigh the\ngovernment\u2019s documentary evidence.\nDepartment Counsel bears the burden of proving controverted SOR allegations by substantial\nevidence.  The substantial evidence standard is a lower standard than preponderance of the evidence.\nWithin the framework of the substantial evidence standard, the Judge is required to weigh conflicting\nevidence.  The weighing of evidence is within a Judge\u2019s discretion, and will not be disturbed by the\nBoard absent a showing by Applicant that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, or not supported by the record as a whole.  The Board sees\nno basis for disturbing the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence in this case.  The documentary evidence\nrelied on by the Judge when he concluded that Applicant had engaged in the underlying conduct\nalleged was sufficient to sustain that conclusion.  The mere assertion by Applicant that the\ndocuments contained hearsay evidence is not sufficient to significantly undermine the reliability of\nthe representations contained in the documents, particularly where the documents were official\ndocuments promulgated by the hotel in the course of its business.  The Judge was bound to consider\nApplicant\u2019s version of events relating to his termination, but the Judge was not bound, as a matter\nof law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate that the Judge made findings or reached conclusions on controverted issues\nthat were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd.\nAug 17, 2006).       \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Guideline E mitigating factors did not apply\nto his case was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant claims it was error\n\n\u201cThe information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or\n1\nreliability.\u201d\n\u201cThe falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct\n2\ninformation voluntarily.\u201d\n\u201cThe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the\n3\nfacts.\u201d\nSubparagraph 1.b of the SOR alleged Applicant failed to disclose the fact of his termination from his hotel\n4\nemployment on his security clearance application.  In its brief, Department Counsel correctly points out that Applicant\u2019s\nstatement of facts in his brief seems to implicitly dispute whether Applicant intentionally falsified his security clearance\napplication.  However, Applicant\u2019s appeal arguments do not, either implicitly or explicitly, challenge the Judge\u2019s finding\nthat Applicant engaged in falsification.  The Board concludes that in this instance, the posture of Applicant\u2019s statement\nof facts do not rise to the level of an assertion of error, and therefore the issue of whether the Judge erred in finding that\nApplicant engaged in falsification is not before us.\n3\nfor the Judge not to apply Guideline E Mitigating Condition 1  to SOR allegation 1.a dealing with\n1\nhis termination from his hotel employment and the related underlying conduct, and it was error for\nthe Judge not to apply Guideline E Mitigating Conditions 2  and 3  to mitigate the Judge\u2019s finding\n2\n3\nof falsification under allegation 1.b of the SOR.4\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\ncompel the Judge to apply a particular mitigating factor in an applicant\u2019s favor and does not compel\nhim to make an overall favorable security clearance decision. \nThe basis of Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge should have applied Guideline E Mitigating\nCondition 1 is Applicant\u2019s assertion that the evidence of record failed to substantiate the allegation\nthat Applicant engaged in a violation of the hotel\u2019s policy.  Applicant\u2019s argument regarding the\napplication of Mitigating Condition 1 is based on his assertion that a reasonable mind could not have\narrived at the conclusion that Applicant actually violated company policy based on the government\u2019s\nevidence.  Here, Applicant is merely restating the initial argument he made regarding the legal\nsufficiency of the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant violated company policy and failed to take\nresponsibility for his actions.  Inasmuch as the Board has already concluded that there was sufficient\nrecord evidence for the Judge to conclude that Applicant did actually commit the acts for which he\nwas fired, Applicant\u2019s argument regarding Mitigating Condition 1 is not persuasive.\nRegarding Guideline E Mitigating Condition 2, Applicant alleges that the Judge never\nconsidered or applied it.  There is no presumption of error below, and the Board notes that in the\nJudge\u2019s decision, he stated that he considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions.\nMoreover, as a matter of law, Guideline E Mitigating Condition 2 is not applicable to the facts of\nthis case.  Mitigating Condition 2 is properly used in a case where the falsification is old and the\napplicant subsequently provides correct information to the government about other matters not\ncovered by the old falsification.  In a situation where an applicant seeks to correct a falsification,\nsuch as the instant case, the potentially applicable factor, if there is one, is Mitigating Condition 3\n\n4\n(E.2.A5.1.3.3), not Mitigating Condition 2.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. July\n10, 2000).\nRegarding Guideline E Mitigating Condition 3, Applicant argues that the Judge erroneously\nfound that Applicant did not acknowledge he was fired until he was confronted by an investigator,\nsince there is no evidence in the record to support this conclusion.  Applicant then argues that,\nbecause the record supports the application of Mitigating Condition 3, the \u201cBoard must find in favor\nof Applicant and dismiss SOR Paragraph 1.b.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s assertions are not persuasive.   The\nrecord evidence indicates that Applicant did not disclose his termination from the hotel until he was\nat his security clearance interview.  The record also indicates that the investigating agent asked about\nthe hotel in the context of previous employments and Applicant indicated he worked there.  The\ninvestigator then asked if anyone at the hotel would have anything negative to say about Applicant,\nat which time Applicant supplied the investigator with a name and the hotel management.\nSubsequently, Applicant informed the investigator that he had been fired from the hotel.  On these\nfacts, the Board declines to hold that the Judge was required, as a matter of law, to apply Guideline\nE Mitigating Condition 3, or to otherwise find that Applicant\u2019s falsification had been mitigated.\nTherefore, Applicant has not established that the Judge erred.  \nApplicant alleges that the Judge failed to properly apply the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  In\ndoing so, he emphasizes the favorable evidence in the record concerning his overall employment\nhistory, work ethic, reliability, and high job performance ratings.  He argues that even if the Board\nfinds the SOR disqualifying conditions to be substantiated, consideration of Applicant\u2019s other\npersonal and employment history over a ten-year period can only lead to the conclusion that he\nqualifies for the privilege of holding a security clearance.  The presence of some favorable evidence\ndoes not compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  In this case, after a review of the record and the Judge\u2019s\ndecision, the Board concludes that the Judge adequately considered the whole person factors\nenumerated by Applicant.  The Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 4, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 18, 2007, \nApril 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing ten Items, \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the FORM \non January 14, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. On March 27, \n2008, DOHA assigned the case to me. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 4, 2007, Applicant denied all factual \nallegations contained in the SOR, except \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 3.a, which he did not answer.  \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and married. From August 1976 to October 1986, he \nwas on inactive status with the U.S. Navy Reserves. He was a Petty Officer Second \nClass (E-5). He obtained a Top Secret clearance in March 1977. From October 2002 to \nJanuary 2003, he was in the Navy\u2019s active reserves, stationed in the Middle East. Since \nNovember 2003, he has worked for a federal contractor, as a security officer at a \nmilitary base in the Middle East. Prior to his current position, he worked in various \npositions in private industry and experienced some periods of unemployment. (Item 5).  \n \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant filed an SF 86.  In response to two questions inquiring \nwhether he had any financial debts more than 90 or 180 days delinquent, he answered \n\u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose eight delinquent debts, falling within the purview of those \nquestions. In response to a question inquiring whether any tax liens had been filed \nagainst him, he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose a state tax lien filed against him in \nJuly 2003 for income taxes owed for the years of 1999 and 2000.   \n \n \nOn May 14, 2007, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories addressing 15 \ndelinquent debts, some of which were later included in the June 28, 2007 SOR. At the \ntime he completed the Interrogatories; he was working in the Middle East and claimed \nhe was not receiving correspondence from some of the creditors regarding the debts. \nHe requested more time to investigate some of them. His specific responses in the \nInterrogatories to the debts, alleged in the SOR, are noted below.1   \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated July 2004, October 2005, March \n2007 and March 2007, Paragraph 1 of the SOR alleges ten delinquent debts and one \noutstanding tax lien, totaling $20, 911.  The status of those debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nAmount \nCreditor \nStatus \nResponse per Item 6 \na. \n$2,067 \nCredit card  \nUnpaid  \nClaims paid; no documentation\nb. \n$715 \nDepartment store \nUnpaid \nClaims 14 yrs old \nc. \n$1,516 \nUnknown \nUnpaid \nTo investigate debt \nd. \n$1,068 \nDepartment store \nUnpaid \nTo investigate debt \ne. \n$1,759 \nCredit card \nUnpaid \nClaims paid; no documentation \n                                                          \n1 Applicant indicated that he enclosed a current credit bureau report with the completed Interrogatories \nthat provided proof of payment for some of the debts.

Although he stated in his June 2007 Interrogatories that some of the \ndebts were paid or would be investigated, he did not provide documentary evidence to \nsupport those claims when he filed his Answer to the SOR in August 2007 or \nsubsequent to receiving the FORM in January 2008. A December 2007 CBR contained \ninformation on the above debts. (Item 10). \n \n \n \nApplicant denied the Government\u2019s allegations under Guideline E, regarding \nfalsification of the SF 86 and offered no explanation for not disclosing the debts or the \nstate tax lien when he completed the form in June 2004.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Based on three CBRs and his statements, Applicant has been \nunable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing 14 years ago. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer \nexamination. \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation. The guideline includes examples of conditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), \nthe disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \n\n \n5 \n \n \njudgment.@ Some of Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose over 14 years ago and \ncontinue to the present. Because the problems are ongoing, this condition does not \napply.   \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant did not offer \nany substantive evidence to support the application of this condition.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not present any evidence that \nhe received credit counseling and/or that his financial problems are under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ He provided evidence that he paid one of the eleven debts, warranting a \nvery limited application of AG & 20(d). He produced documentation indicating that he \nsuccessfully disputed one debt, which is sufficient to trigger some mitigation under AG & \n20(e), which applies when \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG & 20(f) is not applicable to the facts in this case.    \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b and 2.c of the SOR that Applicant falsified \nhis answers to three questions on the SF-86, because he failed to disclose specific \ndelinquent debts and a state tax lien. The Government contended that those omissions \nmay raise a security concern and be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged \nunder AG \u00b6 16 in this case is: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n6 \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied those allegations, but failed to provide an explanation for his \ndenial. Based on the record evidence, the Government established said \ndisqualification.  As a result of the absence of any explanation or evidence in \nrefutation or mitigation of those the allegations, none of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his SF 86, \nconstitutes a violation of Federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a \nfelony, and raises a disqualification under AG \u00b6 31.  Based on the finding under \nGuideline E that Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86, the Government established \nthe disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 31(c): \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d None of the criminal conduct mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 31 is \napplicable because Applicant failed to address the allegation.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 53 years old, and \nserved his country in the military reserves for more than ten years, during which time he \nheld a security clearance for a period of time.  In May 2007, the Government sent him a \nset of Interrogatories, alerting him to the financial delinquencies that could adversely \naffect his security clearance. In his response to the Interrogatories, he claimed several \ndebts were paid and requested more time to investigate other debts. He also indicated \nthat some of the debts were very old, implying that he was no longer responsible for \nthem. In June 2007, he received the SOR, detailing the specific debts in question and \narticulating concerns under the personal and criminal conduct guidelines. In January \n2008, he received the FORM, notifying him that he had an additional 30 days to \nrespond and submit documentary evidence. Despite having approximately eight months \nto resolve the Government\u2019s concerns, he took no action. His failure to responsibly \nrespond to those concerns calls into questions his judgment and reliability. \n    \nGiven his long history with the military and familiarity with security clearances, it \nis troubling that he did not aggressively take affirmative steps to address the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns. Without proof that Applicant has resolved all of his outstanding \ndelinquent debts and established a budget and track record of managing his finances, \nsimilar problems are likely to occur in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

For convenience, the security clearance application in this decision\nwill be called an SF 86.  There is an allegation of falsification of the 2003 SF 86. \nOn August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing\n2\napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987,\nas amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  Even if the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nwere in effect, my ultimate decision would be the same.\nItem 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 30, 2006) at 1-2.  Item 1 is the source for the remainder\n3\nof this paragraph. \nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated September 22, 2006).  \n4\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, dated January 29, 2007.  Applicant signed\n5\nthe receipt on February 4, 2007. \n2\nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, psilocybin, psilocyn, methamphetamine,\nlysergic acid diethylamide, and/or phencyclidine on diverse occasions for more than 20\nyears.  He also sold small amounts of marijuana and cocaine.  He falsified his 2003\nsecurity clearance application to conceal his cocaine use from his employer and the\ngovernment. He failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to his drug involvement\nand personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 20, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted\na Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   On August 30, 2006,  the Defense Office of\n1\n2\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR alleges security concerns\n3\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under\nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on September 22, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 19,\n4\n2006, was provided to him on February 4, 2007, and he was afforded an opportunity to\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  His\n5\n\nId. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after receipt to submit information.\n6\nSpeed, LSD, PCP and mushrooms are essentially street names for methamphetamine, lysergic acid\n7\ndiethylamide, phencyclidine, and psilocybin or psilocyn respectively. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) (PCP and LSD); Neal\nv. United States, 516 U.S. 284, 286 (1996)(LSD); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 492 (1976) (Speed); United\nStates v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1  Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Schedule I controlled\nst\nsubstance psilocybin or psilocyn).\nItem 4, supra note 4, is the source for all factual assertions in this paragraph. \n8\nItem 5, supra note 1, at Sections 1 (date of birth), 5 (education), 6 (employment), 8 (spouse), 9 (relatives), and\n9\n11 (military service) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated. \nUnless stated otherwise, the source for the facts in this section is Applicant\u2019s affidavit to a Special Investigator\n10\nof the Office of Personnel Management on April 19, 2006.  Applicant noted that details concerning the numbers of times\nhe used drugs and the dates of use may vary from previous statements, and such details were difficult for him to recall.3\nsubmissions were due by March 6, 2007, but he did not submit any additional\ninformation.  The case was assigned to me on April 9, 2007.\n6\nProcedural Issue\nA National Security Agency (NSA) clearance decision statement, dated October\n7, 2004, is included in the file as Item 7.  This statement describes an NSA interview on\nJuly 20, 2004, wherein Applicant evidently admitted more extensive and recent illegal\ndrug use than is contained in the other exhibits I received.  This July 20, 2004, NSA\ninterview is not in my file. I have decided not to give any evidentiary weight to Item 7.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAs to the factual allegations, Applicant admitted use of marijuana, cocaine, PCP,\nLSD, Speed, as well as sale of marijuana and cocaine.  He also admitted that he failed\n7\nto provide complete information about his drug involvement on his 2003 SF 86.   His\n8\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  From 1983 to 1986,\n9\nhe attended a university, and he was awarded a bachelor of science degree. He has no\nprior military service. Applicant is married, however, he is separated from his spouse.\nHe has twin sons who were born in 1992. \nDrug Involvement\nWhen Applicant was 16 or 17, he was arrested for possessing or using\nmarijuana.   He attended a court-ordered drug education class. He has not received any\n10\nother drug counseling.\nDuring Applicant\u2019s high school years from 1973 to 1977, he used marijuana once\nor twice a week with friends at parties.   He also used LSD and mushrooms five to six\n\n4\ntimes each, and Speed once or twice with friends.  He did not recall using LSD or\nmushrooms after high school.\nDuring his college years from 1977 to 1982, Applicant used marijuana on the\nweekends.  He also used PCP and cocaine three times per year.  From 1983 to 1986,\nApplicant attended a university away from home.  He used marijuana and cocaine on the\nweekends and during summer breaks when he returned home. He did not remember how\noften or how much of these drugs he used.  He did not remember using PCP, LSD or\nSpeed during those years. \nFrom 1986 to 1992, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was two or three times per year,\nand his cocaine use was six times per year.  He was employed and could afford more\ncocaine. Thereafter, he continued to use cocaine sporadically, with his last cocaine use\noccurring in the Summer of 2002. \nFrom 2000 to 2003, Applicant had a medical problem and received a prescription\nfor percocet. He used percocet when the pain was not severe \u201cto feel the high that it\ngives.\u201d Id. at 4.  \nWhen he was using drugs, generally he purchased a quantity and then would use\nhalf and sell the other half.  Sometimes he would share drugs with friends without\nselling it to them. \nIn both his April and September 2006 statements, Applicant said he did not intend to use\ndrugs in the future because he had too much to lose, and now \u201cleads a faith based life.\u201d  He noted\na dramatic change in his life and his reliance on religion for support.  However, his response to the\nSOR included the comment, \u201cI have not abused [drugs] since approximately 2000-2001 time frame,\u201d\nwhich was inconsistent with April 2006 statement about ending his cocaine use in the summer of\n2002. \n     \nPersonal Conduct\nQuestion 27 of Applicant\u2019s October 20, 2003, security clearance application asks,\n\u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally\nused a controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe did not include any cocaine use that occurred from October 1996 until\nSummer 2002, even though his use of a controlled substance was in the last seven years\nbefore signing his SF 86. \nIn his statement to a Special Investigator of the Office of Personnel Management\n(Item 6 at 6), Applicant said:\nI did not list my drug use on my SF 86 because I felt rushed filling it out and I was\nafraid that my current employer would find out.  In addition, I feared that I would not\n\n5\nget hired or not get a clearance. I was not purposely trying to be deceitful, and am\nremorseful. I do not feel that this information could be used to blackmail or coerce\nme.\n In his response to the SOR (Item 4 at 1-2), Applicant provided an explanation for his\nincorrect answer:\nI deny\u2013I did not deliberately and intentionally falsify material facts when I filled out\nthe application.  At the time the application was submitted I had one day to fill it out\nand get it back to my prospective employer so I rushed through the application.  So\nI did not give my drug history much thought nor did I feel that I had ample time to\nponder it. However, I did clarify the fact that there was an abuse within the last seven\nyears after the application was submitted.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative judge\nmust consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to\nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure\n2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n11\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n12\nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s]\nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 6, 2006).\n6\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing facts\nby \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly\n11\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of\ndisproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at\n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).12\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nDrug Involvement\nUnder Guideline H, \u201c[i]mproper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding\nan individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence\nmay impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of\nclassified information.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.  \n\n\u201cDrugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering substances, and include: Drugs, materials, and other\n13\nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens); and Inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.2.1 and E2.A8.1.1.2.2. \n \u201cRecent drug involvement\u201d also is addressed as a disqualifying condition (DI DC 5) in the Directive \u00b6\n14\nE2.A8.1.2.5.  This disqualifying condition applies only in the context of failure to successfully complete a drug treatment\nprogram.  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).\nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency\n15\nanalysis of an Administrative Judge, who held a hearing on July 31, 2006, stating:\nThe Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a  lengthy and serious history of improper\nor illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security clearance process.\nThat history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year from 1974 to 2002.  It also\nincluded the illegal purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance.\nAlthough Applicant did not abuse drugs while holding a security clearance, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use was much more\nextensive than the Applicant in ISCR Case No. 05-11392. \n7\nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions (DI DC) are pertinent to security concerns:\nDI DC 1: Any drug abuse. \nDI DC 2: Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution.  \n13\nDI DC 3: Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner\nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A8.1.2.1 to E2.A8.1.2.3. \nDI DC 1 applies because Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, lysergic acid\ndiethylamide, phencyclidine, and/or psilocybin or psilocyn.  DIDC 2 applies because he possessed\nand sold illegal drugs.  \nIn regard to SOR  \u00b6 1.h, DI DC 3 does not apply because there is insufficient evidence that\nApplicant\u2019s percocet use deviated from approved medical direction.  There is no evidence that a\nmedical professional told Applicant not to take percocet unless he was suffering severe pain. \nSecurity concerns based on DI DCs 1 and 2 can be mitigated by showing that the drug\noffenses were not recent (DI MC 1).   Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.1.  There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for\n14\ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of\nthe totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6\n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any\nevidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time\ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or\nrehabilitation.\u201d  Id.  DI MC 1 does not apply because Applicant\u2019s last cocaine use was in the Summer\nof 2002.   He receives some credit for not using drugs for almost five years, however, his overall\n15\ndrug abuse was so significant and long lasting, that the recency mitigating condition is not fully\n\nAdministrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d ISCR Case 02-\n16\n03186 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006). Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to present documentary\nevidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004) (holding\nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative evidence may be used in common sense evaluation to\ndetermine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are established). In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the Appeal\nBoard explained:\nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of evidence, lack of\ncorroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence suspect, unreliable, or incredible. .\n. . Evidence that lacks corroboration must be evaluated in terms of its intrinsic believability and in light\nof all the other evidence of record, including evidence that tends to support it as well as evidence that\ntends to detract from it.  \n8\napplicable. \nDrug involvement security concerns may be mitigated under DI MC 2 when the \u201cdrug\ninvolvement was an isolated or aberrational event.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.2. DI MC 2 does not apply\nbecause applicant used drugs on numerous occasions for  more than 20 years.\nFor DI MC 3, security concerns pertaining to drug involvement may be mitigated by a\n\u201cdemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.3.  Applicant\nstated he made a dramatic change in his lifestyle, and that he has turned to religion for support and\nguidance.  He receives some credit under DI MC 3 for these positive changes, however, Applicant\nhas not shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no drug abuse.  Morever, his failure to\npresent readily available corroboration about his rehabilitation from co-workers, neighbors, family\nand friends is an important factor in this decision.  DI MC 3 does not apply.\n16\nIn regard to DI MC 4, security concerns may be mitigated when an applicant has satisfactorily\ncompleted \u201ca prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and [after receiving] a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical\nprofessional.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.4.  DI MC 4 does not apply because Applicant has not\ncompleted a prescribed drug treatment program.  \nAlthough his eventual admission that he used many illegal drugs on numerous occasions\nover many years was not prompt, he deserves some credit under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for\neventually providing accurate information.  See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n26, 2006) (indicating when a mitigating condition cannot be fully applied, \u201csome credit\u201d is still\navailable under that same mitigating condition).  \nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncould indicate that applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE2.A5.l.l.  \n \nTwo personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\n\nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n17\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving\nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge\nto conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden\nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission. \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2006) the Board stated that an applicant\u2019s statements\n18\nabout his or her intent and state of mind when the SF 86 was executed were relevant but not binding information.\nMoreover, an applicant\u2019s statements are considered in light of the record evidence of a whole.  Id. \u201cThe security concerns\nraised by an applicant\u2019s falsification are not necessarily overcome by applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the\ngovernment.   See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).\u201d Id.\n \n9\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.2.  A security concern\nmay result under PC DC 3 when an applicant deliberately provides \u201cfalse or misleading information\nconcerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical\nauthority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.11.2.3.   \nPC DCs 2 and 3 are established by substantial evidence.  He deliberately and intentionally\ngave a false answer to Question 27 of his October 20, 2003, SF 86, denying his cocaine use within\nthe last seven years.  He admitted he did not disclose his illegal drug use because he was worried\n17\nabout his employment and security clearance.  In his response to the SOR, he was not candid when\nhe said the falsification was not deliberate or intentional.  \n18\n \nA security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by establishing by substantial\nevidence personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC).  Under PC MC 1, security concerns may\nbe mitigated when the \u201cinformation was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of\njudgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.1.  PC MC 1 does not apply\nbecause the falsification was substantiated, deliberate, and it is relevant to a determination of\njudgment, trustworthiness and reliability. \nPC MC 2 applies when the \u201cfalsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the\nindividual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.2.  PC\nMC 3 applies when the \u201cindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.3.  Applicant receives some mitigation\nunder PC MCs 2 and 3 because the only record evidence that Applicant failed to accurately report\nhis drug use in his 2003 security clearance application was provided by Applicant in subsequent\nsecurity interviews.  Moreover, his false statement on his 2003 SF 86 is not particularly recent.\nHowever, his statement in response to the SOR fails to take full responsibility for the falsification,\nweighing against greater mitigation. \nPC MC 4 applies  when omission \u201cof material facts was caused or significantly contributed\nto by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information\nwas promptly and fully provided.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.4.  There is no evidence that such a\ncircumstance as described in PC MC 4 occurred.  Security concerns can be mitigated under PC MC\n\nThe failure to provide a forthright response to the SOR may be considered as follows: \u201c(a) to assess an\n19\napplicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c)\nto consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision\nof the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section\n6.3.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24,\n2003)).\n10\n5 when an applicant \u201chas taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.5. PC MC 5 may not be fully applied\nbecause the steps made toward rehabilitation are insufficient in magnitude and his response to the\nSOR fails to take full responsibility for the falsification, and understates the recency of his drug\nabuse.  In sum, Applicant\u2019s October 20, 2003, false statement denying drug use during the last\nseven years reflects questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and dishonesty.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive provision E2.2.1. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s history of drug abuse, his actions\nconcerning illegal drug use and drug sales, and the falsification of his 2003 security clearance\napplication were knowledgeable and voluntary. He is 48 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully\nresponsible for his conduct. The likelihood of future drug abuse remains substantial because\ninsufficient time has elapsed since his last cocaine use, and Applicant has not provided sufficient\ncorroborative evidence of a change in his lifestyle. Applicant\u2019s use of drugs while away from his\nwork environment mostly at parties makes his conduct less aggravated, but the possibility remains\nof compromise of sensitive or classified information. Standing individually the falsification might\nbe regarded as an isolated offense and somewhat remote in time.  However, the false information\non his 2003 SF 86 cannot be viewed in isolation.  On April 19, 2006, he made a written statement\nadmitting he did not provide the drug information on his SF 86 because he was concerned about\nlosing his employment, and denial of his security clearance application. Then in his response to the\nSOR on September 22, 2006, he said the falsification was not deliberate and intentional. His failure\nto be forthright and to take full responsibility in his 2006 response to the SOR weighs against\nmitigating the falsification allegation.   A person who engages in \u201cconduct involving questionable\n19\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations could indicate that [applicant] may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\u201d\nApplicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence for his drug abuse. He\nstopped using drugs in October 2002 and desires to maintain his drug-free status in the future. He\nrelies on religion to support his lifestyle change. He disclosed his extensive history of drug abuse in\nhis 2006 interview. Applicant disclosed the only record evidence showing his drug abuse. The\nabsence of evidence of any prior violation of her employer\u2019s rules or requirements, and his evident\nsincerity about making future progress weigh in his favor. Abstaining from drug abuse for almost\nfive years shows significant evidence of his efforts to establish his responsibility and rehabilitation.\nHowever, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement and personal conduct.  His falsification of his 2003\nSF 86, and his failure to be more candid in his response to the SOR weighed most heavily in my\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n20\n11\ndetermination.\nThe evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility\nand suitability. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence,\n20\nmy application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s case.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 13, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline F had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because Applicant has received counseling for\nhis financial problems, he initiated a good faith effort to resolve those problems, and there are clear\nindications that his problems are under control.  In support of his argument, he cites to several\nDOHA Hearing Office decisions in which applicants in ostensibly similar circumstances were\ngranted clearances.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has\nsubmitted in his appeal brief.  However, such decisions are binding neither on Hearing Office Judges\nnor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 05-14853 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2007).\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise\nof sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole. See ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7\n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd.\nMar. 19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See ISCR Case No.\n05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nA review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered\nby Applicant against the record evidence relating to the length, seriousness and recency of the\ndisqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to most of the factual\nallegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.

Applicant answered the SOR\nin writing on April 24, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on February 16, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on April 3, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for April 20, 2007. The notice was sent to Applicant via e-mail on the same\nday. A written notice was mailed on April 5, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2007.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE AND PROCEDURE \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons, marked as\nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. The motion requested the addition of an allegation to the SOR under \u00b6 1,\nas follows:\nn.  You are indebted to [creditor] on an account that was placed for\ncollections in about August 2004 in the approximate amount of $11,263. As of\nFebruary 9, 2007, this debt had not been paid.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Motion prior to introducing any evidence. Applicant objected at\nthat time to the Motion. The Motion was denied. After the Government presented its exhibits,\nDepartment Counsel again moved to amend the SOR. Applicant did not object this time. The Motion\nto Amend the Statement of Reasons was granted. SOR \u00b6 1.n is added as stated in HE I.\nThe Government offered nine exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 9. The Government\u2019s list of exhibits was marked as HE II. Applicant did not object to GE\n1 through 8, and they were admitted. GE 9 is a report of investigation from Applicant\u2019s background\ninvestigation. Applicant was advised of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive to object to its\nadmission. Applicant objected to GE 9. His objection to GE 9 was sustained, and it was not\nadmitted. The Government submitted a document, marked as HE III, containing a matrix of how\nDepartment Counsel viewed the evidence. I considered this as a type of demonstrative evidence or\nhearing memorandum, and considered it for that limited purpose. Applicant testified and offered five\nexhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, and admitted without objections.\nThe record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material. He did so\nin a timely manner. The documents were sent to Department Counsel as attachments to e-mail, and\nforwarded by Department Counsel via fax. Several of the documents were difficult to read, and I\nasked Department Counsel to forward better copies. Department Counsel forwarded better copies\nvia e-mail. Department Counsel\u2019s letter forwarding the documents is marked HE IV. Department\n\nTr. at 98-102; GE 1-2.\n2\nTr. at 45-48; GE 1 at 7.\n3\nTr. at 48-56; GE 1 at 10; GE 7 at 6.\n4\n3\nCounsel\u2019s fax cover sheet is marked HE V. The far right side of the first page of AE I was cut off.\nI asked Department Counsel to contact Applicant to forward a better copy. Applicant did so and a\nbetter copy was received by Department Counsel, and forwarded via e-mail. The e-mail is marked\nHE VI. Applicant submitted 13 documents which were marked AE F through R, and admitted\nwithout objections. The documents are Applicant\u2019s e-mail of May 10, 2007 (AE F), Department of\nTreasury letter of April 21, 2006 (AE G), three receipts (AE H), creditor\u2019s letters and account\nsummary (AE I), three voided checks (AE J), Applicant\u2019s second e-mail of May 10, 2007 (AE K),\npage from April 26, 2006 credit report (AE L), page from February 9, 2007 credit report (AE M),\ncollection agency letter of April 19, 2006 (AE N), collection agency letter of May 23, 2006 (AE O),\ncollection agency letter of May 2, 2007 (AE P), credit union letter of December 23, 2005 (AE Q),\nand credit union letter of May 2, 2007 (AE R).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been married since 2002.\nApplicant was married and divorced three times before this marriage. He has four children. His two\noldest children are adults and on their own. There are two children living with Applicant and his wife\noverseas. Applicant has some college credits, but does not have a degree.2\nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from 1975 to 1978, the Army National Guard from 1978\nto 1980, and the U.S. Army from 1980 until he retired in 1996, as a Staff Sergeant (E-6). Applicant\nhas lived and worked overseas since 1996. He was employed by the U.S. Government for a year, and\nsince for defense contractors in support of the U.S. Army.3\nApplicant worked for a defense contractor from 1998 to 2001. The company provided\nApplicant with a corporate credit card. When Applicant left the company in 2001, he owed almost\n$5,000 to the card company. Applicant submitted a security clearance application on January 23,\n2003. He listed a delinquent debt to this credit card company in the amount of $5,000. The credit\nbureau report (CBR) of January 30, 2003, lists a debt to the same credit card company as a bad debt\nand charged off, with a balance of $4,934.  In a statement for his background investigation on July\n4\n1, 2003, Applicant addressed this debt:\nI was employed with [*****] and had a corporate card from [credit card company].\nAlthough I knew it was a \u201cpoor judgment\u201d call, I helped out a friend (co-worker) who\nneeded to have his TDY hotel room and other expenses paid for and I got stuck with\nthe bill, when he didn\u2019t come through. He is no longer with the company. The\n\nGE 3 at 2.\n5\nGE 7 at 6.\n6\nTr. at 53-56, 107-110.\n7\nAE F at 2.\n8\nGE 4.\n9\n4\noriginal agreement was that it would be taken from my pay. A few months later a\nshortage of work came up . . . and I was one of about 8 people that received layoff\nnotices. The amount is still in arrears ($5k).  \n5\nApplicant responded to interrogatories on January 9, 2006. He was asked to address the status\nof several debts. He listed the current balance owed to the above creditor as \u201c0,\u201d and wrote \u201ccredit\nreport attached.\u201d He attached a joint CBR for him and his wife, dated June 13, 2005. The CBR did\nnot list a debt to this creditor. The CBR of January 30, 2003, lists the date of last activity of this debt\nas March 1998.6\nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent debt to the above creditor in the amount of $4,934. In his\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt, and stated, \u201c[t]o the best of my knowledge, I\u2019ve\nnever knowingly applied to, nor received credit/financial aid from this institution.\u201d \nApplicant testified that he made payments over several years on this debt, and that he\nbelieved the bulk of it, if not all of it, was paid off. He submitted no supporting documentation of\npayments at the hearing.  \n7\nApplicant was provided an opportunity to submit documents after the hearing. He provided\nno documentation about this debt in his post-hearing submission. In his post-hearing e-mail, he\nappears to be linking this debt to the debt in the amount of $13,357, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k:\nThere have been only phone conversations with this entity. It seems that these\nagencies are connected, in that one has bought the \u201cdebt\u201d from another and added\nadditional charge[s] each time. There were multiple answers regarding the type and\norigin of the debt during our call. The first explanation is it\u2019s either a personal loan\nor a credit card. It was also explained this had to be a \u201cwalk in\u201d and sign type of\ntransaction. Since the origin dates given were 26 March 98 (Sold to [creditor listed\nin SOR \u00b6 1.k] on 22 March 02) and I\u2019ve not lived in the US since September 96, it\nis impossible that I would/could have done this. The one factor they emphasized is\nthat this is/was NOT a corporate card account. This agency is refusing to send any\ndocumentation they may have proving the validity of this account, therefore I am\ncontesting this through the Credit Reporting Agencies.8\nApplicant responded to interrogatories on January 9, 2006. He attached a joint CBR for him\nand his wife, dated June 13, 2005. The CBR lists Applicant\u2019s wife as \u201cB\u201d for borrower, Applicant\nas \u201cC\u201d for co-borrower, and \u201cJ\u201d for joint debts.  The CBR lists the debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n9\n\nId.\n10\nAE A.\n11\nTr. at 56-57.\n12\nTr. at 57-62, 65.\n13\nTr. at 62-63, 65-69.\n14\nTr. at 64-65, 73. \n15\nAE B, Q, R.\n16\nAE N-P.\n17\nTr. at 69-73; GE 4.\n18\nGE 4, 7 at 6.\n19\nAE F at 1-2.\n20\n5\n1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l, as incurred by Applicant\u2019s wife.  Those debts total\n10\napproximately $7,374. Applicant submitted a notarized letter from his wife stating that the debts in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l were incurred by her or her former husband, and that Applicant\nhas not signed any documentation which would make him responsible for the debts.11\nApplicant acknowledged his wife was responsible for the debt in \u00b6 1.b.  He denied any\n12\nknowledge of the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.f.  He stated the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j have\n13\nbeen paid.  Applicant\u2019s wife disputes the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and 1.l.\n14\n15\nApplicant provided documentation that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, to a credit union in the amount\nof $647, has been paid.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j, to a collection agency on behalf of a jewelry\n16\ncompany in the amount of $479, has also been paid.17\nThe CBR of June 13, 2005, lists the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k in the amount of $13,537, as\nbelonging to Applicant. The CBR lists the date of last activity on the account as occurring in\nNovember 1998. Applicant disputed this debt, and stated he was not in the country in 1998, when\nit was incurred.  In his post-hearing submission, Applicant linked this debt to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a,\n18\nas addressed above. There is nothing in the two CBRs that list the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k,\nwhich would indicate these represent the same debt.  \n19\nThe CBRs of September 13, 2006 and February 9, 2007, list the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n in the\namount of $11,263. Applicant denied any knowledge of this debt. In his post-hearing submission,\nApplicant stated he contacted the credit reporting agency, and provided them with his and his wife\u2019s\ninformation, but it \u201cyielded no results with our SSN\u2019s or names.\u201d20\nWhen Applicant retired from the Army in 1996, he owed $3,188 to a military exchange. He\nstopped paying this debt, and it was transferred to collection where it continued to accrue finance\n\nAE I.\n21\nGE 7 at 4; GE 8 at 4.\n22\nGE 1 at 10.\n23\nGE 7 at 6; GE 8 at 6.\n24\nGE 3 at 2.\n25\nAE I. The debts to the exchange system were not listed as allegations in the SOR, possibly because of\n26\nApplicant\u2019s assertions that they were paid. The evidence that the exchange debts remain unpaid came from Applicant\nin his post-hearing submission. This information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in\nassessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating\nconditions.\nGE 4 at 2.\n27\nTr. at 105-107.\n28\nAE F-I.\n29\nTr. at 102-105; GE 4. This information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered\n30\nin assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating\nconditions.\n6\nand penalty charges.  The CBRs of March 23, 2001 and January 30, 2003, list this debt as\n21\ndelinquent in the amount of $3,351.  Applicant\u2019s security clearance application of January 23, 2003,\n22\nlists a delinquent debt to a different exchange from 1998, in the amount of $4,000.  The CBRs of\n23\nMarch 23, 2001 and January 30, 2003, list a delinquent debt to the second exchange in the amount\nof $299.  In his statement of July 1, 2003, Applicant wrote that he had a debt to the second exchange\n24\nfor more than $4,000, but that it was being paid and was at that time less than $300.  The debts to\n25\nthe two exchanges appear to be two separate debts. The documents from the exchange system, which\nApplicant submitted after the hearing, reflect a balance of $6,353 as of May 4, 2007, which includes\na balance of $6,157 for a deferred payment plan, and a balance of $196 for a credit card. The\ndocuments also show an account balance added to their collections system in March 2004, in the\namount of $193.  This amount would appear to be the balance of the account which Applicant stated\n26\nwas paid. When Applicant responded to interrogatories on January 9, 2006, he listed the current\nbalance owed to the two exchange accounts as \u201c0,\u201d and wrote \u201ccredit report attached.\u201d  At the\n27\nhearing, Applicant testified money was taken out of his retirement pay for this debt, and the debt was\npaid.  The evidence Applicant presented in his post-hearing submission shows four involuntary\n28\npayments made between April 2006 and July 2006, totaling $1,877. Three voluntary payments of\n$212 each were made between March 6, 2007 and May 1, 2007. The balance of $6,353 as of May\n4, 2007, did not yet reflect the last payment of $212.29\nWhile Applicant worked overseas as a defense contractor, he did not file federal income tax\nreturns. On October 18, 2005, the Internal Revenue Service levied Applicant\u2019s wages in the monthly\namount of $394, to pay his delinquent tax debt of $4,389. Applicant stated that he thought because\nhe was overseas in a \u201ctax-exempt\u201d or \u201ctax-free\u201d status, he was not required to file returns. The debt\nto the IRS has been satisfied.30\n\nAE C.\n31\nTr. at 80-81.\n32\nGE 4; AE D, E.\n33\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n34\nId. at 527.\n35\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n36\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n37\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n38\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n39\n7\nApplicant provides financial support to his elderly disabled mother. He and his wife also\nsupport her mother.  His wife served in the U.S. Army for 24 years and retired in 2004, as an E-7.\n31\nShe does not work because she is disabled as a result of her military service. She receives retirement\nand disability pay.32\nApplicant is a combat veteran, having served in Operation Desert Storm. He is highly\nregarded by people who know him from his time in the Army, and during his current employment.\nHe has received a number of awards and accolades for his service in support of the U.S. Army. His\nsupervisor is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial issues and is working with Applicant and an Army legal\nassistance attorney to resolve Applicant\u2019s financial and credit issues. He believes Applicant is a\ndecent and honest man and recommends him for a security clearance.  \n33\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n34\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n35\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n36\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n37\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n38\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n39\n\n8\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\nI do not find Applicant responsible for the debts in his wife\u2019s name. They are relevant to\nApplicant\u2019s overall financial situation, and will be considered for that purpose. Applicant provided\ncontradictory information about the status of several of his debts. In his security clearance\napplication in 2003, Applicant listed a $5,000 delinquent debt to the credit institution reflected in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He admitted he still owed the debt when he submitted a statement in July 2003. In his\nresponse to interrogatories in January 2006, he listed the balance owed as $0. In his response to the\nSOR, Applicant denied ever having an account with this institution. At the hearing, Applicant\nadmitted having this account, but testified that most, if not all of it, was paid. Applicant did not\nprovide proof of payment in his post-hearing submission. Instead, he once again denied ever being\nresponsible for this debt. Applicant\u2019s contradictory responses cause me to give less credence to his\nexplanations regarding the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.n. \nThe Government did not submit any admissible evidence to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.m. That allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nI conclude Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history\nof not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.k, and 1.n.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It\nwas an isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\n\n9\nis being resolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nI find the three debts are still owed. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and not\nisolated. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. \nApplicant testified that he accrued the one debt because he paid another employee\u2019s hotel bill\nwith his corporate credit card, and the employee did not pay him back. He later denied ever having\nan account with that creditor. Applicant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent and not credible. He did not\npresent credible evidence that his financial issues were beyond his control. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 does\nnot apply.\nApplicant is working with an Army legal assistance attorney to resolve his financial and\ncredit issues. He presented evidence that several of his wife\u2019s debts have been paid. The debt to the\nIRS was paid through an involuntary levy on his wages. Most of the payments to the military\nexchange were made involuntarily. Applicant has not made enough voluntary payments on his debts\nto establish a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. I also do not\nfind a clear indication that the problem is being resolved or is under control. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 and\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 do not apply.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.a. The Government did have submit any admissible evidence to\nsupport this allegation. SOR \u00b6 2.a is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered all the evidence, and every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s long history of faithful service to this country, and the favorable\ncharacter evidence on his behalf. I also considered all the adverse financial information. Applicant\u2019s\ncontradictory responses regarding certain debts cause me concern. I am unable to grant him any\ncredibility when he first acknowledges he owes a debt, then states that it was paid, then denies ever\nhaving an account with the creditor, then again states it was paid, and then finally denies again that\nhe ever had the account. \n\n10\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\n2\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nNovember 30, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility\ndetermination is sustainable; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s falsification of\nhis security clearance application was deliberate; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision\nunder Guidelines F, J and E is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\n(1) Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination with respect to the\nApplicant is unsupported by the record evidence, and asks that the Board set it aside and substitute\na favorable credibility determination in its place.  In support of that contention, Applicant relies on\na page from an unknown document.  Applicant has not demonstrated error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  A Judge\u2019s credibility determination is entitled to deference on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-05072 at 5 (App. Bd. July 14, 2005).  Although such determinations are not immune from\nreview, the party challenging them has a heavy burden. See ISCR Case No. 04-00225  at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 9, 2006).   After reviewing the record, the Board concludes Applicant has not met that burden.\nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination is based upon a permissible interpretation\nof the record evidence.  It is supported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose adverse information about his financial problems in response to two\ndifferent questions.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.   The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or\nreject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26,\n2006).\n\n3\n(3) Finally, Applicant argues that the Judge erroneously weighed the evidence in this case\nand that her overall unfavorable decision under Guidelines F, J and E failed to consider the whole\nperson concept and  is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.  The Board does not find this\nargument persuasive.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by his disqualifying conduct had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the\nApplicant with respect to several of the factual allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at\n4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nclearance decision under Guidelines F, J and E is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

After his honorable discharge, Applicant\nwent to work for a civilian contractor.  He has held a security clearance for over 20 years, first a\nsecret and subsequently a top secret.  Applicant earned an engineering degree while working for the\ncontractor and currently supervises 160 employees.  Applicant\u2019s wife, born in Lebanon, became a\nU.S. citizen in 1991.  She is a nurse at a V.A. hospital.  Applicant\u2019s children are all native-born U.S.\ncitizens.\nApplicant\u2019s work performance has earned him numerous awards and evaluations.  Applicant\nhas \u201csignificant assets,\u201d all located in the U.S. except the house in Lebanon.  His friends and\ncolleagues view him as \u201cdedicated to the U.S. and U.S. security interests.\u201d  \nThe Judge made no explicit finding about political tensions within Lebanon.  However, in\nhis Conclusions section, he stated the following: \u201cLebanon is not officially recognized as hostile to\nthe U.S., but...it does contain some terrorist and other groups that are not friendly to the U.S.\u201d  We\ntreat this as a finding of fact.  See ISCR Case No. 02-20110 at n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2004) (\u201cThe\nBoard will treat a finding of fact [as such] regardless of where it appears in the Judge\u2019s decision\u201d).\nB. Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable\nmind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in\nthe record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\nadministrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal\nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)). In evaluating\nthe Administrative Judge\u2019s finding, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings as to Applicant\u2019s and his\nfamily\u2019s citizenship and residence status.  However, in his discussion of the Judge\u2019s application of\nFIMC 1, the Department Counsel argues that the Judge underestimates the significance of terrorist\norganizations operating within Lebanon.  Counsel asserts that it is error for the Judge not to \u201ctake\ninto consideration the substantial impact of terrorists, para-military organizations, and other extra-\ngovernmental groups.\u201d  \nWe have examined the record and conclude that there is merit in Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument.  Government Exhibit 2 contains information about terrorist organizations operating inside\nLebanon, such as Al Qaida and Hizballah.  Exhibits 3 and 4 also provide evidence as to the political\nconditions in Lebanon.  The Judge\u2019s one passing reference to these matters is an inadequate basis\nfor an in-depth analysis of Applicant\u2019s case.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s finding on this matter\ndoes not adequately take into account record evidence. \nAdditionally, we note that, after the close of evidence in this case, the United States\ngovernment issued official pronouncements concerning the changing political situation in Lebanon\nwhich have a direct bearing upon the issues to be resolved in this case.  Because these\npronouncements are issued in response to fluid world events independent of any personal\ncircumstances of Applicant, and because it is important to make accurate and timely assessments of\nthe political landscape in foreign countries when adjudicating Guideline B cases, the Board takes\nofficial notice of the following:   \n(1) Statement on the Situation in Lebanon, Public Papers of the Presidents (Feb. 5, 2007)\n(\u201cSyria, Iran, and Hizballah are working to destabilize Lebanese society.  Their goals are clear.  They\nfoment violence in order to prevent the establishment of a special tribunal in response to former\nPrime Minister Hariri\u2019s assassination, to prevent full implementation of U.N. Security Council\nresolutions calling for Hizballah\u2019s disarmament, and to bring down Lebanon\u2019s democratically elected\nGovernment...\u201d); \n(2) Statement on the Government of Syria, Public Papers of the Presidents (Dec. 18, 2006)\n(\u201cSyria should disclose the fate and whereabouts of the many missing Lebanese citizens who\n\u2018disappeared\u2019 during the decades of Syrian military occupation.  The Syrian regime should also cease\nits efforts to undermine Lebanese sovereignty by denying the Lebanese people their right to\nparticipate in the democratic process free of foreign intimidation and interference\u201d); \n\nOfficial notice is a broader concept than judicial notice, incorporating within its scope the subject matter\n1\nexpertise of the administrative agency.  See de la Llana-Castellon v. INS, 16 F.3d 1093, 1096 (10  Cir. 1994); McLeod\nth\nv. INS, 802 F.2d 89, 93 (3d Cir. 1986).  Even judicial notice, however, may be taken at the appellate level.  Fed. Rule\nEvid. 201, Advisory Committee Notes.  See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 737 at n.7 (2002); Directive E3.1.19 (\u201cThe\nFederal Rules of Evidence . . . shall serve as a guide\u201d in cases adjudicated under the Directive).  Federal evidentiary law\nrecognizes a distinction between legislative and adjudicative facts insofar as they are subjects of notice.  A legislative\nfact is one which is necessary to understand a principal of law, such as the probable adverse consequences of failing to\nhonor the spousal privilege in criminal prosecutions.  By its nature, such a fact is not subject to evidentiary proof.  Fed.\nRule Evid. 201, Advisory Committee Notes.  Official pronouncements by the President, State Department, Department\nof Defense, or other appropriate federal agency on matters of national security are equivalent to legislative facts for\npurposes of DOHA adjudications in that they bind the Judge and are not subject to refutation.  See ISCR Case No. 02-\n04786 at n.6 (App. B. Jun. 27, 2003)(\u201cOfficial statements by the U.S. State Department concerning foreign relations of\nthe United States are legislative facts that can be taken into consideration by DOHA Administrative Judges or the Board\nin these proceedings\u201d); ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)(\u201cThe official positions taken by the President\nof the United States and other appropriate federal officials concerning the war on terrorism are not proper subjects to\nbe litigated in DOHA proceedings\u201d).  Recognizing the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that security clearance\ndeterminations are \u201can inexact science at best,\u201d (Dept. Of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 529 [1988] (internal citation\nomitted), the Board acknowledges that an accurate geopolitical context is crucial in Guideline B cases.  Indeed, an\napplicant\u2019s having relatives living in a country hostile to the United States is one explicit concern cited by the Supreme\nCourt for denying a clearance.  Id.       \n4\n(3) State of the Union Address, Public Papers of the Presidents (Jan. 29, 2007) (\u201cHizballah\nterrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to\nundermine Lebanon\u2019s legitimately elected Government\u201d); and \n(4) Travel Warning, United States Department of State (Dec. 22, 2006) (\u201cSince the August\n14 [2006] cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, political tensions in Lebanon have\nincreased and have become a cause for concern in recent weeks.  Hizballah maintains a strong\npresence in many areas of Lebanon...\u201d).  \nThe presence of immediate family members in a country which a hostile foreign power like\nSyria is attempting to destabilize, and in which terrorist groups operate with a substantial degree of\nautonomy, poses a real concern in the adjudication of Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nSee, e.g., Executive Order 13338 (May 11, 2004), declaring a state of emergency to address, inter\nalia, Syria\u2019s interference in Lebanon; ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004).  \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, we are not basing a final agency decision on matters officially noticed\nat the Appeal Board level.  Rather, we are returning the case to the Judge for expansion of the record\nto take into account significant changes in world events which have a direct bearing upon\nApplicant\u2019s case.  We note Cytacki v. INS, 996 F.2d 1214 (6  Cir. 1993), in which the Board of\nth\nImmigration Appeals upheld an immigration judge\u2019s denial of an application for asylum in the U.S.\nThe Board took official notice of events in Poland which occurred after the close of the  record,\nevents which it concluded buttressed the decision of the immigration judge.  The Sixth Circuit\nupheld the Board\u2019s decision, stating that the Board \u201cmay take official notice of uncontroverted facts\nconcerning political conditions in asylum seekers\u2019 home countries...\u201d    \n1\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, having already found harmful error, we rely upon Cytacki for the\nproposition that decisions in Guideline B cases should be made to the greatest extent possible in the\ncontext of current political conditions in the country at issue.  We remand the case to the Judge with\ninstruction that he reopen the record, allow Department Counsel an opportunity to proffer for official\n\n5\nnotice matters such as those discussed above, allow Applicant an opportunity to offer evidence, and\nallow the parties to reargue the case.  The other issues in the case are not ripe for consideration at\nthis time.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1986 to 1990,\nand has worked in the defense industry, with a security clearance ever since.  His immediate family,\nall U.S. citizens, resides with him.  His elderly mother and siblings are citizens/residents of Lebanon.\nHis ties to Lebanon are minimal compared to those with the U.S. in the U.S.  He is highly thought\nof by his colleagues.  He has received security awareness training and strongly and credibly avers\nhe will always protect U.S. interests.  Mitigation has been shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn December 5,  2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on January 3, 2006.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 27, 2006, setting\nthe hearing for March 15, 2006.  The Government introduced four (4) exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibits (GX) 1 - 4).  Applicant testified, and introduced 34 exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A -\nHH). The transcript was received on  April 7, 2006.  On June 26, 2006, I issued a decision favorable\nto Applicant, which Department Counsel appealed.  On April 12, 2007, the Appeal Board issued a\ndecision remanding the case to me with directions to correct the stated errors.\nThe Appeal Board noted that I had stated that \u201cLebanon is not officially recognized as hostile\nto the U.S., but it does contain some terrorist and other groups that are not friendly to the U.S.\u201d\n(Decision at page 2), treating my conclusion as a finding of fact (Ibid., citing ISCR Case No.  02-\n20110 at n.2., App Bd. June 3, 2004.  The Board found merit in Department Counsel\u2019s contention\nthat I had erred in not taking \u201cinto consideration the substantial impact of terrorists, paramilitary\norganizations, and other extra-governmental organizations (Decision at page 3).  After reviewing\nthe record, the Board concluded that my \u201cone passing reference to these matters is an inadequate\nbasis for an in-depth analysis of Applicant\u2019s case\u201d (Id.). \nOn Remand, I have again carefully considered the official notice documents submitted by\nDepartment Counsel at the hearing, the Department of State Travel Warning on Lebanon, dated\nDecember 28, 2005 (GX 2); Department of State Consular Information Sheet on Lebanon, dated\nDecember 29, 2005 (GX 3); and Department of State Background Note on Lebanon, dated\nDecember 28, 2005 (GX 4).  \nPost Hearing Official Notice and Other Documents\nAt my request, Department Counsel submitted copies of the documents cited by the Appeal\nBoard, which he had also provided to Applicant.  I received them on May 24, 2007 (Department\nCounsel Remand Documents).  On June 25, 2007, I received Applicant\u2019s response  to the documents\n\n3\nand several others off his own (Applicant\u2019s Remand Documents).\nPursuant to the Appeal Board order to reopen the record, I have considered the additional\nOfficial Notice documents that were issued after the original closing of the record in 2006.  These\ninclude: \n(1) Statement on the Situation in Lebanon, Papers of the Presidents (February 5, 2007).\nSpecifically, that \u201cSyria, Iran, and Hizballah are working to destabilize Lebanese society.  Their\ngoals are clear. They foment violence in order to prevent the establishment of a special tribunal In\nresponse to former Prime Minister Hariri\u2019s assassination, to prevent full implementation of U.S.\nSecurity Council resolutions calling for Hizballah\u2019s disarmament, and to bring down Lebanon\u2019s\ndemocratically elected government . . . \u201d\n(2) Statement of the Government of Syria, Public Papers of the Presidents (December 16,\n2006).  Specifically, that \u201cSyria should disclose the fate and whereabouts of the many missing\nLebanese citizens who \u2018disappeared\u2019 during the decades of Syrian occupation.  The Syrian regime\nshould also cease its efforts to undermine Lebanese sovereignty by denying the Lebanese people the\nright to participate in the democratic process free of foreign intimidation and interference.\u201d \n(3) State of the Union Address, Public Papers of the Presidents (January 29, 2007).\nSpecifically, that \u201cHizballah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the\nregion and are seeking to undermine Lebanon\u2019s legitimately elected Government,\u201d and \n(4) Travel Warning, United States Department of State (December 22, 2006).  Specifically,\nthat \u201cSince the August [2006] cessation of  hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, political terrorists\nin Lebanon have become a cause for concern in recent weeks.  Hizballah  maintains a strong\npresence in many areas of Lebanon\u201d (ON 9).\nI have also reviewed (5) President Bush\u2019s Address Before a Joint Session of Congress  on\nthe State of the Union, January 23, 2007, expressing serious concerns about Hizballah\u2019s interference\nin Lebanese affairs, with the assistance and encouragement of Syrian and Iran (Official Notice (ON)\ndocument 5, at pages 4, 5); (6) Executive Order 13338, May 13, 2004, which \u201cBlock[s] Property of\nCertain Persons and Prohibit[s] the Export of Certain Goods\u201d (ON 6);  U.S. Department of State\nCountry Reports on Terrorism - Chapter 2- Middle East Middle East and North Africa Overview,\u201d\nwhich describes recent \u201cmajor terrorist attacks [that] occurred in Algeria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel,\nLebanon, and Egypt\u201d with \u201cpolitical violence throughout the year\u201d in Lebanon (ON 7).\nAlso, Department of State Press Statement: \u201cUnited States Condemns Violence in Lebanon\u201d\n(ON 8); U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006 - Lebanon,\nwhich describes Hizballah interference in Lebanon (ON 10); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of\nConsular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet - Lebanon, May 24, 2007, which updates information\nrelating to the specific risks to Americans traveling in Lebanon (ON 13); U.S. Department of State,\nBureau of Near East Affairs, February 2007, Background Note: Lebanon, February 2007, which\ndescribes Hizballah\u2019s terrorist activities in Lebanon and against Israel (ON 14; and CRS Report for\nCongress - Lebanon, November 28, 2006, which discusses political and military conditions in\nLebanon and Hizballah\u2019s continuing terrorist activities (ON 15). \n\n At the hearing, SOR 1.a. was amended to delete the reference to Applicant\u2019s father, who\n1\nis now deceased.\n4\nAppeal Board Decision No. 02-29403 (December 14, 2004), cites the security clearance risks\nthat could arise from terrorist activities, and concluded that \u201cthere is no good reason to assume that\nterrorists would overlook an opportunity to obtain an opportunity to obtain classified information\nfor sale to the highest bidder as a means of obtaining funding for their terrorist activities\u201d (ON 11).\nThe Appeal Board cites Cytacki v. INS, 996 F.2d 1214 (June 18, 1993) for the proposition\nthat DOHA \u201cmay take official notice of uncontroverted facts concerning political conditions in\nasylum\u2019 seeker\u2019s home countries . . . \u201d (ON 12).     \nTaken together, all of the new Official Notice Documents, paint a picture of instability and\nterrorist activity in Lebanon, a country that is not officially hostile to the United States.  For the most\npart, terrorism is aimed at destabilizing the Lebanese government and gaining control over areas of\nLebanon.  Hizballah is also active in terrorism against neighboring Israel, and to a lesser degree the\nUnited State and European countries.  I accept Department Counsel\u2019s view of the situation in that\ncountry as presented in his May 24, 2007 Reply to my Order.  I do note recent developments\nshowing significant efforts on the part of the Lebanese government to combat terrorism within its\nborders. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 47-year-old manager for  a defense contractor.  The February 24, 2005 SOR\ncontains six (6) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant admits all allegations,\nwhich are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.   \n1\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n1.a. - Applicant\u2019s mother (73) is a citizen and resident of Lebanon, but now holds a U.S.\nPermanent Resident Card and makes visits to Applicant in the U.S., the last time being in late 2005\n(Response to SOR and Tr at 27, 28).  Her age and health problems make it unlikely she will be able\nto return to the U.S.  His three sisters, and two brothers remain citizens and residents of Lebanon.\nHis deceased father (2003) was a taxi driver most of his life.\n1.b. -  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law  hold U.S. Permanent Resident Cards.\nThe father-in-law is still in Lebanon, but the mother-in-law has come back to the U.S. and resides\nwith Applicant and his wife.  His three brothers-in-law are interested in immigrating to the U.S., as\nis one sister-in-law.  One brother-in-law is a city traffic policeman.  Other than that, none of his\nrelatives have any connection with any level of government in Lebanon (Tr at 22).\n1.c. - Applicant sends his mother approximately $500.00 every  two to three months, to assist\nher financially.  Lebanon does not have any system like Social Security \n\n5\n1.d. - Applicant owns a home in Lebanon valued at approximately $78,000.00.  His home\nin the U.S. is worth about ten times that figure, and he has significant additional net worth.\n1.e. - Applicant sent approximately $35,000.00 to his brother-in-law (a civil engineer) in\nLebanon, to construct the home in which Applicant and his family can stay when visiting Lebanon.\n1.f. - Applicant traveled to Lebanon in 1991 and has returned three times since then.  His last\nvisit was in August 2005.  He visits Lebanon primarily so that his daughters can get to know their\nuncles, aunts, and cousins.  They all have and use only U.S. passports.  \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 1984 (AX FF).  He served in the U.S. Navy for four\nyears (1986-1990), including a period aboard an aircraft carrier.   He was honorably discharged in\n1990, and has worked for a Navy civilian contractor ever since, with first a Secret DoD security\nclearance and then a Top Secret clearance. \nHe began his current employment as a technician, obtained an engineering degree, and\neventually became a supervisor and program manager of up to 160 employees, dispersed in at least\nfour locations in the U.S. and Asia (Tr at 18, 20, 21).  He last attended and completed a Security\nbriefing in May 2005 (AX BB, and Tr at 19).  No problems of any kind are reflected in the record.\nApplicant married his current, Lebanese-born, wife in 1991.  She became a U.S. citizen in\n1996. She is a nurse at a Veterans Administration hospital. They have two U.S.- born daughters, 10\nand 12.  Applicant has two grown sons from his first marriage (Tr at 25).  The family is deeply\ninvolved in American life and education (Tr at 25-27).  His first visit to Lebanon since becoming\na citizen in 1979 was in 1991.  He returned to visit his family in 2000, 2003, and 2005.  He did not\nencounter any problems during any of his visits, the first two of which occurred during the Syrian\noccupation. \nNone of his relatives in Lebanon are aware of what he does or that his has a security\nclearance, or even what that term means.  They are aware only that he is  an engineer (Tr at 30).\nApplicant\u2019s employer has given him certificates, awards, and consistently high evaluations\n(AX A, AX B, AX C, AX D, AX E, and Tr at 19-21).  He is financially well off and has significant\nassets (AX F, AX G, AX H, AX I, AX J, AX K, AX L, AX M, AX N, AX O (the only property in\nLebanon, estimated value of about $78,000.00), and AX P.  Eleven of his friends and colleagues,\nmany of whom have known him for a decade or more, view him as dependable, a man of integrity,\ndedicated to the U.S. and U.S. security interests, and worthy of continuing to hold the security\nclearance he has held for some 20 years (AX T-AX Z, and AX CC, AX EE, AX FF, and AX GG).\nThe contents of all of these documents are impressive in establishing Applicant\u2019s ties and\ncontributions to his adopted country and its security interests.  \nPOLICIES\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify\npersonal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether\n\n6\nit is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An\napplicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having\nto prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise\ncontroverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as\namended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d Viewed in\nan overall context, under E2.2.3.of the Directive, the ultimate determination of whether the granting\nor continuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful consideration of the\nfollowing, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. Explained further\nbelow (emphasis added):  \nThe Whole Person Concept: Under E2.2.1., the DoD adjudicative process is an examination\nof a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. The adjudicative process is the careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the\nfollowing factors: 1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 2. The circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; 3. The frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; 4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 5. The voluntariness of\nparticipation; 6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n7. The motivation for the conduct; 8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand 9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nCONCLUSIONS\nOnly Guideline B is alleged in the SOR and a careful analysis shows that the Government\u2019s\nconcern is focused not on any questionable conduct or statements by Applicant but, rather, on the\nfact of his relationships with his relatives in Lebanon.  \n\n The version of the Directive that is applicable in this case is the one that was applicable\n2\nto cases wherein the SOR was issued prior to September 1, 2006.\n7\nForeign Influence  - The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate\n2\nfamily, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection,\ninfluence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These\nsituations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of\nclassified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other\ncountries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \nDisqualifying Conditions: 1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign\ncountry; and 8. A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated\nbusiness that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence. \nMitigating Conditions: E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s),\n(spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are\nnot agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could\nforce the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States. \nIt is basic to the adjudication process that the ultimate burden of proof is on the Applicant\nand that any doubts must be resolved against the granting of a clearance.  In this case, there is\nnothing in the evidence establishing whether or not Applicant\u2019s relatives in Lebanon are/may\nbe/might be/could be agents of the Lebanese government or are in a position to be used, voluntarily\nor not, and knowingly or not, to seek to persuade Applicant to act against U.S. security interests.\nTo the degree that there is a risk, it is a hypothetical one, based primarily on the undisputed presence\nof the relatives in Lebanon and his close relationship with them.  \nThe concern in this case is really that Lebanese government authorities or non-governmental\nentities might put pressure on his relatives in Lebanon to persuade Applicant to act against U.S.\ninterests.  There is some evidence (from Applicant) that his relatives are not \u201cagents\u201d of a foreign\npower, but there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether they are susceptible to pressure\nfrom the Lebanese government or intelligence agencies, or whether they might ask Applicant to act\nagainst U.S. security interests (see, ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (December 12,  2000) at pp 8, 9; and\nISCR Case No. 00-0485 (February 1, 2002) at p.4. \nI understand and accept the premise that a security risk may exist when an individual's\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by\naffection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.\nThese situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other\ncountries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \nWhat is absent from the record is any evidence supporting an inference that Applicant would\nfeel \u201cforced\u201d to choose between his loyalty to them and to the United States. In fact, the contrary\nhas been shown to be the case. There is no suggestion in the record that Applicant would voluntarily\nact against U.S. security interests or that he would respond to persuasion or pressure of any kind.\nHistory of Decision Making in Guideline B Cases\n\n8\nDOHA experience indicates that the first filter for Guideline B cases sent to DOHA for\nconsideration of an SOR being issued is Department Counsel, who can decline to issue SORs in\ncases not deemed appropriate for such issuance.  An analysis of the favorable Guideline B cases that\nare issued by Administrative Judges but not appealed by Department Counsel indicates that among\nthe generally accepted reasons for non-issuance are (1) that the foreign country was not deemed an\nespionage or information-gathering threat; and/or (2) that the ties/contacts were not close enough\nto raise the possibility that the Applicant might feel \u201cforced to choose\u201d between those ties and his\nloyalty to the United States.  A comparison of decisions on the DOHA database shows that favorable\ndecisions where the foreign country was deemed both friendly and not publically considered active\nin information gathering; e.g., Canada, Mexico, and United Kingdom, are rarely appealed by\nDepartment Counsel and so are rarely the subject of Appeal Board decisions.  \nAlmost without exception, the cases appealed involve countries formally viewed as falling\ninto three major categories: \n(1) those hostile to U.S. interests, or considered unfriendly to the U.S.; e.g., Iran.\n(2) those considered generally friendly or neutral toward the U.S., but which contain\nsignificant non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are involved in terrorism or anti-US.\nactivities; e.g., Jordan and Lebanon.\n(3) those considered generally friendly to the U.S., but which are known to be active in\nespionage or at least, information gathering aimed at classified information or non-classified but\nsensitive proprietary information; e.g., Taiwan and Israel. \nIn the past, the Appeal Board has reversed or remanded favorable decisions issued by more\nthan 30 DOHA Administrative Judges have granted clearances.  In such cases, the Appeal Board\nfound to be non-mitigating, extensive evidence of an applicant\u2019s history in and close ties to the U.S.,\nlong time possession of a security clearance, an unblemished work record, and the receipt of high\npraise from his superiors and colleagues and awards for dedicated service to the national defense\neffort.  As I understand these Appeal Board decisions, the abstract risks that an applicant might be\nasked to act improperly was found to outweigh the objective evidence of dedication, integrity, and\naverred commitment to protecting U.S. security interests. \nAfter a thorough evaluation of the relevant language in both the pre- and post-September 1,\n2006 versions of the Directive, I conclude that the drafters of the new version of the Directive have\nclarified their intent as to the meaning of the Guideline B Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions\nstated in the version of the Directive applicable to this case . . . \nIn a recent decision, the Appeal Board stated the following:\nNevertheless, the Appeal Board does not hold an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to\na standard of perfection.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 2 (App. Bd., Dec. 20, 2007\n[sic, presumably 2006].  In this case, there are numerous unchallenged findings of\nfact which cumulatively support the ultimate conclusion of the Chief Administrative\nJudge\u2019s whole person analysis that Applicant has sufficiently strong ties to the\nUnited States to overcome the Government\u2019s security concerns.  These facts include:\nApplicant immigrated  to the United States in 1982; Applicant has been a U.S.\ncitizen since 1986; Applicant\u2019s wife and children are U.S. citizens; Applicant has had\na security clearance since 1991; and Applicant has not used a Jordanian passport\nsince his arrival in the United States.  Considering the record as a whole, the Chief\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s ultimate favorable security clearance  decision is sustainable\n(ISCR CASE No. 02-17369 (April 5, 2007) at 2).\n\n In a recent case, the Appeal Board accepted the Judge\u2019s \u201cemphasize . . .that Applicant\n3\ncredibly testified that he realized the security implications of his marriage and had repeatedly\ntold his wife in blunt and graphic terms that he would not compromise national security under\nany circumstances, even if her family members were harmed by the PRC. Applicant has\nsuccessfully rebutted the normal presumption that an applicant has ties of obligation or affection\nto his in-laws.\u201d The Appeal Board also noted the Judge\u2019s acceptance  of Applicant\u2019s testimony\nthat he had complied with security procedures regarding his trip to the PRC to meet his fianc\u00e9e.\nAs a result, \u201cthe record supports the Judge's conclusions, which are not arbitrary or capricious\u201d\n(ISCR Case No. 04-06564 (May 30, 2006)).  In the same case, the Appeal Board rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s contention that the Judge\u2019s \u201cwhole person analysis\u201d was unsustainable. The\nAppeal Board found that the Administrative Judge had restated some of the Guideline B\nmitigating factors and presented a reasonable explanation for her decision, given the relevant\nfactors in this\n case, making the favorable decision sustainable.\n9\nDOHA Appeal Board decisions based on Guideline B have traditionally focused on the\nidentity of the foreign country and the nature of Applicants personal, business, and other connections\nto that country.  In such cases, the risks of someone asking an Applicant to act against U.S. security\ninterests was clearly treated as controlling and more important than the question of how the\nApplicant was likely to respond to such improper contacts.\nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 02-17369, cited above, is directly contrary to the earlier line\nof cases.  The above cited language by the Appeal Board is unequivocal in stating the principle that\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept must be given considerable weight and can be persuasive.  In summary,\ntaking into consideration the nature of the foreign country, compelling evidence of an Applicant\u2019s\nintegrity, judgment, trustworthiness, and dedication to U.S. security interests, can \u201covercome the\nGovernment\u2019s concerns\u201d (Id.).  The personal background evidence in ISCR Case No. 02-17369 was\ndetailed and impressive, but that in the present case is even more so.\nApplicant has a solid record of maturity, integrity, and long service to his country. Despite\nwhatever risk may exist because he has family in Lebanon, nothing in the record suggests he would\nhesitate before acting instinctively to protect U.S. interests.   Under the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d he\n3\nhas not done or said anything that raises any questions about where his loyalties, commitment, and\ndedication lie, nor does the record suggest any reason to deprive the United States of his valuable\nservices.  In summary, the record as a whole leads to the conclusion that Applicant has the integrity,\ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking  a DoD security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.\n    \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.\n                  \nFor the Applicant\n\n10\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.          \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.d.       \n         \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.e.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

TUIDER\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.  Concerning the security guidelines, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005.  The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix\n8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued\non September 1, 2006 or thereafter, and they apply to this case because the SOR is dated October 11, 2006.  Both the\nDirective and the Regulation are pending final amendment.\n2\nSecurity concerns of criminal conduct, financial considerations, and personal conduct were\nidentified during Applicant\u2019s background investigation for a security clearance.  These concerns\nsurfaced following the uncovering of several misdemeanor arrests, 15 unpaid debts, and the belief\nApplicant had failed to disclose misdemeanor arrests.  Applicant has successfully mitigated all these\nconcerns.  Clearance is granted.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On October 11, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR)  detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal\n1\nConduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 3, 2006, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on December 15, 2006.  On January 5, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling a hearing for January 22, 2007.  The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant.  \nThe government offered 15 documents, which were admitted without objection as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 15.  The Applicant offered 4 documents, which were admitted\nwithout objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D.  The Applicant timely submitted four\npost-hearing documents, which admitted without objection as AE E through H.  DOHA received the\ntranscript on January 31, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a\nthorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant testified at his hearing and I found his testimony credible.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old sensor systems engineer employed by a defense contractor since\n\nThe court record did not specify the length of time his license was suspended.  GE 4.\n2\n3\nNovember 2003.  He seeks a security clearance as a requirement of his employment.  He is\nunmarried with no dependents.  He served on active duty in the Navy from January 1996 to January\n2001, and was honorably discharged as a Sonar Technician Second Class, pay grade E-5.  He\npreviously held a security clearance at the secret level while in the Navy.\nWhile Applicant was in the Navy, he was arrested in December 1999 for driving under the\ninfluence (DUI), a misdemeanor under applicable state law.  His case was continued because he was\nforward deployed and when he appeared in court in December 2000, he was found guilty, and\nsentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended for 30 days, fined $250.00 and ordered to pay court costs of\n$40.00.  Additionally, his driver\u2019s license was suspended , and he was ordered to complete an\n2\nalcohol education program (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).  Tr. 20-23, 32-35, 41-43.  \nIn December 2000, Applicant was charged with show cause, a misdemeanor under applicable\nstate law (SOR \u00b6 1.b.).  There was apparently some confusion regarding the court date when\nApplicant was to appear for his December 1999 DUI charge and on June 2002, he was found guilty\nof this charge and sentenced in absentia.  Applicant is of the belief this was ultimately \u201cdropped.\u201d\nTr. 23.  Source documents offer two dispositions \u2013 \u201cDismissed\u201d and \u201cGuilty in Absentia.\u201d  GE 6.\nThe government was unable to clarify this point.  Tr.  43-47.\nIn March 2001, after Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he along with fellow\nemployees were attending off-site job-related training.  The driver of the company-rented mini van\nwas pulled over and charged with DUI and the passengers to include Applicant in the mini van were\nall cited for open container in a vehicle after the arresting officer noticed empty beer cans in the\nvehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.c.).  Following this citation, Applicant paid a $200.00 fine.  The government\u2019s\nevidence indicated this citation was a vehicle infraction versus a criminal offense under applicable\nstate law.  Tr. 17-18, 23-25, 40.\nIn November 2003 Applicant attended a bachelor party and was tasked during a scavenger\nhunt to obtain \u201cthe coolest license plate [he] could find.\u201d  When he located a license plate meeting\nthe specifications of his tasking, he was caught by the police removing a license plate from a vehicle\nand charged with petit larceny, a misdemeanor under applicable state law (SOR \u00b6 1.d.)  He was\nsentenced to ten days in jail, suspended for ten days, fined $100.00 and ordered to pay court costs\nof $64.00.  Tr. 25, 38-40, GE 7.  \nIn December 2003, Applicant was charged with driving on suspended license, a misdemeanor\nunder applicable state law (SOR \u00b6 1.e.).  This charged stemmed from the suspension he received\nfrom his December 2000 conviction for his December 1999 DUI arrest.  He pled guilty to the charge\nand was sentenced to ten days in jail, suspended for ten days, fined $100.00 and ordered to pay court\ncosts of $64.00.  Tr. 25-26, GE 8.\nIn March 2005, Applicant was charged with driving on suspended license, a misdemeanor\nunder applicable state law (SOR \u00b6 1.f.).  Apparently, Applicant had some confusion regarding his\ndriver license suspension stemming from his December 1999 DUI charge.  He was charged with\nshow cause for failure to appear on May 10, 2005.  On the day of his court date, he was admitted to\nthe emergency room for chest pain, headaches, and dizziness and submitted documentation from the\n\n4\nhospital verifying he was admitted.  Tr. 25-26, 28-31, Answer to SOR.  Applicant reported all\nproblems with his driver\u2019s license had been \u201ccleared up\u201d and that his license was no longer under\nsuspension adding that he used his valid driver\u2019s license to gain access to the building where his\nDOHA hearing was being conducted.  Tr. 26, 35-38.  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is in arrears on 15 debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.o.).  These debts\nare in various stages of repayment or being challenged and all of them are being addressed.\nApplicant submitted a letter to the cognizant credit reporting agency and is disputing the following\nfive debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 - 2.a. (collection account $239.00), 2.c. (collection account $102.00), 2.d.\n(returned check charge $2.00), SOR \u00b6 2.e. (collection account $102.00), 2.f. (collection account\n$387.00), and 2.k. (collection account $23.00).  Answer to SOR, Tr. 47-54, 61, 64-69, 83-84, 86-87,\nAE E.  His reasons for disputing the debts include that certain accounts are not his, he was unable\nto contact creditor, and the account has been paid.  Applicant\u2019s evidence supports the notion these\ndisputes with creditors are made in good faith.\nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h. ($386.00 to pay court fine in SOR \u00b6 1.d.) and 2.j.($288.00\nmedical bill) were resolved through garnishment in 2004 and 2005 respectively.  Applicant did not\nhave the funds to pay these bills when due given his state of underemployment and\nunderemployment at the time.  Answer to SOR, Tr. 54, 56-58, 73-75, 88.\nApplicant has sought the services of a credit counseling service and set up payment plans to\naddress debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. (charged off account $2,484.00), 2.g. (collection account\n$5,966.00), 2.i. (collection account $165.00), 2.n. (collection account $419.00), and 2.o. (collection\naccount $253.00).  He had paid debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f. (collection account $387.00), 2.l.\n(delinquent account $2,297.00), and 2.m. (delinquent account $1,315.00).  Answer to SOR, Tr. 48,\n59-61, 64, 68-71, 84, 87-90, AE B, AE F, AE G.\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a periods of underemployment and\nunemployment after he was discharged from the Navy in 2001.  Until he secured his present position\nin November 2003, he held several low paying jobs to include front desk motel clerk and bartender,\nplus two periods of unemployment.  GE 1.  Tr. 60, 88-89.\nIn August 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application and was cited in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 3.a., and 3.b. for failing to list his March 2001 citation for open container (SOR \u00b6 1.c.\nAlcohol/Drug Offenses), and for failing to list his November 2003 arrest for petit larceny (SOR \u00b6\n1.d.), and his December 2003 charge of driving on suspended license (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) (Police\nRecord/Other Offenses).  In response to Alcohol/Drug Offenses, he did list a more serious 2001\ncharge of driving under the influence.  \nApplicant concedes the information he failed to list on his security clearance application as\nalleged was not listed.  He explained when he was initially hired in November 2003, he completed\na security clearance application at that time and the underlying petit larceny arrest and driving on\nsuspended license charge had not occurred.  He added for some reason, his employer wanted to\nresubmit his security clearance application in August 2004 (GE 1).  When that occurred, he signed\nan application in August 2004 and apparently failed to review and check the form he previously\ncompleted when hired for accuracy.  Regarding his failure to list the March 2001 citation for open\ncontainer, he stated, \u201cIt was just simply a citation that I paid that I had honestly forgotten about. . .\n\n5\nI wasn\u2019t trying to - I mean admitted to the DUI, the other things on my SF-86.  It\u2019s just simply one\nthat I did not remember.\u201d  \nApplicant did submit post-hearing a copy of the security clearance application he submitted\nwhen hired bearing the date of December 4, 2003, which approximates the time he was initially\nhired.  AE H.  Although unsigned, I do not view the absence of a signature as unusual given the fact\nit is his file copy.  I did find Applicant\u2019s testimony on this point to be credible.  Tr. 93-97, 103-107.\nApplicant readily clarified this discrepancy when later interviewed the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator.  Tr. 96-97, GE 2.\nApplicant submitted two letters of reference.  The first letter is from a former Navy\nsupervisor who served with him on board his ship.  This supervisor spoke of Applicant\u2019s\ndependability especially during emergencies.  He described his as the \u201cfirst to volunteer, whenever\nwe were short a man, or needed an extra watch stander, he was always willing to give of himself.\u201d\nAE C.  The second letter is from his current supervisor.  She stated Applicant \u201calways displayed a\nhigh degree of integrity, responsibility and ambition.\u201d  She considers Applicant to be a \u201cvaluable\nresource\u201d and a \u201cdependable team player.\u201d  AE D.\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.\nInstead, they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making\noverall common sense determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the\nevidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant adjudicative\nguidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government\nhas the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a\nnexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, the President has\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified\ninformation to \u201cUnited States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively\nindicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability,\ndiscretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for\n\n6\ncoercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and\nprotection of classified information.\u201d  Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information \u00a7\n3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting\nthe security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is\nrequired is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts\nproven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness,\nthen the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial\nevidence in explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite\nthe existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance. \nSecurity clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto do so.\u201d  See Executive Orders 10865 \u00a7 2 and 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2 \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nDoubts are to be resolved against the applicant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct, a security concern arises by:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\nThe government established its case under Guideline J to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e.  The\ngovernment\u2019s evidence relating to the December 2000 show cause charge alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. is\nconflicting inasmuch as source documents reflect two separate dispositions, i.e. dismissed and guilty\nin absentia.  Applicant is of the belief the charge was \u201cdropped.\u201d  The government was unable to\nresolve this discrepancy following Applicant\u2019s constructive denial.  As such I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.b. in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.  The government\u2019s evidence relating to SOR \u00b6 1.c. indicates this allegation was\na traffic offense under applicable state law versus a criminal offense, and the March 2005 charge of\ndriving on suspended license (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was apparently dismissed.  Applicant submitted competent\nevidence that he was in the emergency room for his May 2005 show cause/failure to appear hearing\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.), and Applicant has demonstrated his problems with the state licensing authority have\nbeen resolved.  I find in Applicant\u2019s favor for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.f.\n\n7\nThe remaining allegations relate to his December 1999 arrest for DUI (SOR \u00b61.a.), his\nNovember 2003 arrest for petit larceny (SOR \u00b6 1.d.), and his December 2003 charge for driving on\na suspended license (SOR \u00b6 1.e.).  These charges are all misdemeanors under the applicable state\nstatute.  Collectively, they raise potential disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  Seven\nyears have elapsed since Applicant\u2019s DUI charge in December 1999.  Although his citation for open\ncontainer in March 2001 is an alcohol-related offense, it does not rise to the level of a DUI.  These\nremaining charges do not reflect a repetitive nature and his driving on suspended license problems\nall stem from his December 1999 DUI arrest.  \nApplicant acknowledges his November 2003 petit larceny arrest was a \u201cvery stupid mistake.\u201d\nHe did not unjustly gain from this \u201clarceny\u201d and understands his sophomoric act is unacceptable\nbehavior.  He has fully complied with all sentencing requirements.  I do not believe from his\ndemeanor that he is likely to repeat any similar acts and given his current status and realizing such\nbehavior has lasting consequences.  Under these facts, I am unable to apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Criminal\nConduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, . . . that it is unlikely to recur an does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  To the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e. CC MD\n32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, not training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, a security concern arises by:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe government established its case under Guideline F to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.o. by\nevidence submitted as well as Applicant\u2019s admissions.  These facts give rise to Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 18(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nand FC DC 18(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nAfter five years of active duty in the Navy, Applicant found the transition to civilian life to\nbe challenging.  He struggled and during that time, he found himself underemployed and\nunemployed.  It took him almost three years to find a career field that is compatible with his skill set\nand pays him a competitive salary.  Now that he is making a living wage, he is able to pay his bills\nand remain current.  He has successfully mitigated all debts alleged by either disputing them, making\npayment arrangements, or paying them off.  \nAdditionally, Applicant has secured the services of a credit counseling service to address the\nmajority of his debts and with their assistance established a budget.  Applicant\u2019s budget reflects he\n\n8\nis living within his means, paying down his past debts, and managing his finances in a responsible\nmanner.\nUnder the facts presented, I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and\nam able to apply MC 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . los of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, . . .) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c) the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control; MC 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, MC(e) the individual has a reasonable basis\nto dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E for Personal Conduct, a security concern arises by:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.\nPosing potential security concerns are Applicant\u2019s documented omission of past criminal\nconduct by failing to disclose his March 2001 citation for open container, which was determined to\nbe a traffic offense versus a criminal offense under applicable state law, and his November 2003\narrest for petit larceny and December 2003 charge for driving on suspended license. \nApplicant testified credibly these omissions were an honest mistake.  His testimony is further\nbolstered by the fact he disclosed the more serious offense of his December 1999 DUI arrest and his\nhaving credibly testified and established by documentary evidence that the later two offenses\noccurred after he submitted the first draft of his security clearance application when initially hired.\nApplicant\u2019s failure in this regard appears to have failed to carefully review his security clearance\napplication when it was resubmitted in August 2004.  While Applicant could reasonably have been\nexpected to be more diligent in ensuring his application was complete in all respects, his judgment\nlapses are not enough to impute knowing and wilful falsification under Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision I have applied the facts and circumstances presented in this case\nusing the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept as required by the Directive.  I have specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s five years of honorable service in the Navy forward deployed, the fact he successfully\nheld a security clearance at the secret level while in the Navy, and the fact he is making all\nreasonable efforts to achieve financial stability.  His apparent success in his new career field is\nfurther evidence of rehabilitation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.f.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a.-2.o.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a.-1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Savarino, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 29 years old and has been a consultant working with web and online initiatives\nfor a defense contractor since June 2003. He did not falsify material facts in either his security\n\n2\nclearance application or declaration of federal employment. Applicant has mitigated the personal\nconduct security concerns. Clearance is granted.\n\nEx. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated August 6, 2004).\n1\nTr. 21-22.\n2\nTr. 24.\n3\nTr. 25.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 6, 2004, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nJanuary 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted or revoked.\nIn a document, dated February 9, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested an in-person hearing. He also stated that he had retained counsel. The case was assigned\nto me on February 16, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 1, 2007, scheduling the\nhearing for March 15, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the\nGovernment offered three exhibits, Exs. 1 to 3. Applicant offered three exhibits, Exs. A to C, as well\nas six exhibits, Exs. A-1 to A-6, requesting for Administrative Notice. All exhibits were admitted\ninto the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline E, personal conduct, subparagraphs 1.a\nand 1.c. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. He denied the\nallegations in subparagraphs 1.b and 1.d. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in\nthe record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 29 years old and since June 2003 has been a consultant dealing with web and\nonline initiatives for a defense contractor. He attended college from 1996 to 2000, and was awarded\na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001. He is single and has no children.2\nFrom January 1998 to August 1999, Applicant worked as a consultant at a college.  The\n3\ncollege had a computer laboratory, and he was responsible for maintaining, setting up, and generally\nsupporting the computers.  He was required to submit a paper time card, which included filling out\n4\nthe hours, portions of hour, signing in, dating time worked, and putting in specific cost codes. He\nwas dismissed from employment after he failed to sign his time cards properly. At the hearing, he\ntestified that on at least six occasions during the course of his employment, he failed or forgot to sign\n\nTr. 26.\n5\nTr. 27.\n6\nTr. 51; Ex. 2 (Declaration of Federal Employment, dated November 13, 2001).\n7\nTr. 52.\n8\nTr. 53.\n9\nTr. 57; Ex. 1, supra, note 1.\n10\nTr. 29.\n11\nTr. 30.\n12\nTr. 31.\n13\nTr. 30-32.\n14\n4\nhis time cards or put in the cost codes. He testified that the secretary complained about his lapses and\nhis contract was terminated.  Applicant indicated that there was never an issue concerning the\n5\namount of time billed on his cards, and he received payment for all the time that he billed.6\nOn November 13, 2001, Applicant completed a Declaration for Federal Employment\n(Optional Form 306). In response to question 11 (Background Information  During the last 5 years,\nwere you ever fired from any job for any reason, did you quit after being told that you would be\nfired, did you leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems, or were you\ndebarred from Federal employment by the Office of Personnel Management?), he answered \u201cno.\u201d\nHe failed to list that he was dismissed from a college where he had been employed. At the hearing,\nApplicant did not recall specifically when he filled out Optional Form 306.  He testified that his\n7\nresponse to the question \u201cwas likely an error or a misstatement.\u201d  His intention was not \u201cto deceive\n8\nthe federal government or anybody else about what happened at [the college].\u201d  He did reveal his\n9\ntermination from the college when he completed the SF 86 on August 6, 2004.10\nFrom July 2000 to June 2001, Applicant worked as a technical engineer for a corporation.11\nHis job required that he travel. His company reimbursed him for expenses, which included car travel\nfor business, gas, and telephone charges. The payment process was via an electronic, automated\ntelephone system. He dialed a telephone number, which allowed him access to the automated system.\nHe then entered his pin number, which was provided by the Human Resources Office, that identified\nhim as the user. He entered the appropriate information for reimbursement.  The receipts for\n12\nreimbursement were turned over to his manager.  Once processing was completed, the funds were\n13\ndeposited into Applicant\u2019s checking account, which was a separate account designated for travel-\nrelated expenses.  He had another checking account that he used for his every day, routine, living\n14\nexpenses.\nApplicant was called into a meeting and told that there was a list of expenses he submitted\nfor reimbursement that were either unauthorized or without receipts. At that time, he had no idea\nwhat the office was talking about. One June 13, 2001, Applicant was terminated for alleged\nquestionable expenses. The period involved was February 2001 through June 2001. On June 27,\n\nTr. 35; Ex. 3 (Business Records regarding Applicant\u2019s termination and unauthorized expenses).\n15\nTr. 41, 71.\n16\nTr. 41.\n17\nTr. 39.\n18\nTr. 42.\n19\nTr. 38.\n20\nTr. 43.\n21\nEx.

B (Report from State Division of Employment and Training indicating unemployment benefits\n24\nreceived by Applicant, dated April 17, 2004).\n5\n2001, he received a letter from the Corporation giving an accounting of the expenses authorized by\nhis manager for payment, but no receipts were submitted to substantiate the expenses.  He was\n15\nrequested to supply his employer with all the necessary receipts for the authorized expenses or to\nreimburse the Corporation $2,659. He was also requested to reimburse the Corporation for all\nunauthorized expenses paid, totaling $15,959. In April 2001, he reported to the Corporation\u2019s Human\nResource Office that he lost a piece of paper with his pin number on it for the account in question.16\nHe was given a new card, which used the same pin number.  He denied knowledge of why\n17\nunauthorized funds were in his account.  He testified that at the time that he did not \u201clook at any\n18\nbank statement [Applicant] ever received at that time.\u201d  He hired a lawyer to assist him in this\n19\nmatter.  The money was found, untouched in his checking account.  He reimbursed the Corporation\n20\n21\n$16,539 because the money was still in his account, and he had not requested reimbursement for\nthose expenses. \nApplicant challenged the Government\u2019s argument that he was terminated for cause. He\ntestified that his employer had announced a lay off of about 1,100 people.  In June 2001, his\n22\nemployer told him that he was being laid off because of financial reasons.  On June 27, 2001, he\n23\napplied for unemployment insurance. He received his first check on July 7, 2001. His last check was\nfor the period ending November 24, 2001.  Each check was approximately $954.\n24\nOn August 6, 2004, he executed a SF 86 and in response to question 20 (Your Employment\nRecord  Has any of the following happened to you in the last 10 years?  - Fired from job - Quit a\njob after being told you\u2019d be fired - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of\nmisconduct - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance -\nLeft a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances), and he responded \u201cyes.\u201d He listed that\nhe was terminated from a college. He also indicated that he was laid off from a Corporation because\nan automated service was making deposits into his account without anyone\u2019s knowledge. He failed\nto disclose that he was terminated for cause for irregularities in his corporate expense account\n\nEx. C (Affidavit, dated March 5, 2007).\n25\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n26\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n27\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n28\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n30\n6\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor submitted an affidavit regarding his professional relationship with\nApplicant at work.  His supervisor stated:\n25\nOverall, I\u2019ve found [Applicant] to be an extremely trustworthy individual who has\nearned my trust. His integrity, discretion, and character are core virtues that I value\nand seek for members of my staff.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n26\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n27\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n28\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.29\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.30\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n31\nId.\n32\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n33\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n34\n7\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n31\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n32\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n33\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n34\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the\nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. The Government has not established a prima facie case for disqualification under\nGuideline E, personal conduct.\nHonesty is critical to a position of trust in safeguarding classified information. I found\nApplicant\u2019s testimony to be credible and honest. I believe that he mistakenly omitted the termination\nfrom his college employment on Optional Form 306 when he completed it in 2001. Moreover, he did\ninclude the information about the college in the SF 86 he completed in 2004. Additionally, the 2001\nincident is mitigated by time. Thus, Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) 17 (a) (the\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) apply. Applicant refuted the argument that he was terminated for cause from the\nCorporation after irregularities concerning questionable expenses were found in his expense account.\nThe evidence clearly supports Applicant\u2019s contention that he was laid off and not terminated. He\nproffered evidence that he received unemployment benefits from June 2001 through November 2001.\nAdditionally, the evidence supports his position that he was unaware of why there were excessive\nfunds in his bank account used at the Corporation to reimburse him for travel expenses. After he hired\nan attorney to challenge the allegation that he misappropriated their money, the Corporation requested\npayment of the overpaid funds. A check was written for $16,539 from the bank account Applicant used\nwith the Corporation. There is no evidence that he received the money from any other bank accounts.\nThere is no evidence that he absconded the funds for his own personal gain. I conclude that PC MC\n17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress)and PC MC 17(d) (the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of\n\n8\nquestionable reliability) apply. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are concluded for\nApplicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nappears to be a mature your man, who is flourishing in his profession. He has successfully provided\nevidence to refute the allegations against him. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable\nfor access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, December 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines E and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2008, admitted all of the allegations\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on February 21, 2008 scheduling it for March 11, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, I received three government exhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and\nthe testimony of three Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non March 19, 2008. Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 24-year-old single man with a high school education. Since\nSeptember 2004, he has worked for the same employer as a cable technician. His\nduties include installing cable and intercom networks for government and private sector\nclients (Tr. 14). \nAccording to his supervisor, he is an outstanding employee whose maturity has\ngrown tremendously since he first began working for him (Tr. 34). The supervisor\u2019s\nconfidence in Applicant\u2019s abilities compelled him to select Applicant instead of older,\nmore experienced personnel to direct some of the company\u2019s projects (Tr. 34). \nApplicant also works part-time as a white water rafting instructor. Before\nobtaining his cable technician job, he worked for a white water rafting company full-time.\nHis supervisor characterized him as \u201ca great employee\u201d (Tr. 43).\nFrom ages 16 to 20, Applicant smoked marijuana. During the first two years of\nthis period, while in high school, he smoked it approximately 10 times per day (Tr. 17).\nOnce, he used it before escorting a group of white water rafters down a river (Answer). \nAfter being caught with marijuana in the school parking lot, Applicant entered\ndrug treatment (Tr. 18). His use decreased to twice per week after the counseling (Tr.\n18). \nApplicant abused other drugs during his teens including cocaine five times , LSD,\nevery other day for three months, and oxycontin, a prescription pain reliever, once\n(Tr.19, 21).\nApplicant has neither used illegal drugs, nor abused prescription drugs since\nSpring 2004. In September 2004, he completed a security clearance application (SF\n86). In response to Question 27 (Your Use of Ilegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Ilegal Use\nof Drugs Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you\nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine,\nhashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines,\ndepressants (barbiturates, methaqualones, tranquilizers etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD,\nPCP, etc), or prescription drugs?\u201d), Applicant under reported the length of time he used\nmarijuana, and did not disclose his other drug use (Answer). During a 2005 interview\nwith an investigative agent, Applicant disclosed the cocaine use, and under reported his\nLSD use, stating that he used it once (Exhibit 3 at 4).\nAfter the 2005 interview, the investigative agent obtained Applicant\u2019s drug\ntreatment records, which indicated the extent of his LSD use (Exhibit 2 at 2). In 2006,\nthe government propounded interrogatories to Applicant seeking, among other things,\nan explanation for under reporting the LSD use. In response, Applicant stated, \u201cI did not\nrealize it was that much of a necessity for the investigation\u201d (Id.). At the hearing, he\n\n3\nstated he did not disclose it because he \u201cthought it would be bad for the investigation\u201d\n(Tr. 24).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s minimization of his marijuana use, and his omission\nof his other drug use from his 2005 security clearance application raises the issue of\nwhether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant was not candid about his drug use because he was afraid that full\ndisclosure would negatively affect his security clearance investigation. Fear of adverse\npersonal consequences does not mitigate falsification. He compounded his SF 86\nfalsification by continuing to minimize his LSD use when an agent interviewed him in\n\n4\n2005. He did not disclose it until 2007, in response to government interrogatories. I\nconclude AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 falsification constitutes a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. I was\nparticularly concerned by his piecemeal, reluctant disclosure of his drug use throughout\nthe investigative process. AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d applies without mitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant was only 21 years old when he completed the SF 86, and he did not\ncompletely omit his drug use from the SF 86. He appears to have matured as\ndemonstrated by his exceptional work performance. Given his falsification, and his\nrepeated failure to correct it, it is too soon to conclude he does not pose a security risk.\nClearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has worked in the defense industry and held a security clearance for 20 years.\nHis wife and children are all U.S. citizens and one child is attending a U.S. Military Academy.  His\nonly tie to South Korea is his 86-year-old mother, who is ailing and unable to move to the U.S.  His\nlong and deep U.S. ties far outweigh those with South Korea.  Mitigation has been shown.  Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn December 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on May 15, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 15, 2007, setting the\nhearing for July 30, 2007.  The Government introduced one (1) exhibit (Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX)\n1).  Applicant testified, and introduced one (1) exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A). The\nGovernment also offered ten (10) Official Notice documents (ON I -X).  The transcript was received\non August 8, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 59-year-old Systems Test Engineer for  a defense contractor.  The November\n27, 2006  SOR contains three (3) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant\nadmits all allegations, which are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  After\nconsidering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status\nof each SOR allegation.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n1.a. - Applicant\u2019s mother (86) is ethnic Japanese and considers herself to be a citizen of\nJapan, but long resident in South Korea, where she moved long ago with the South Korean man who\nwas Applicant\u2019s father, although his parents were never married \u201cas a record\u201d (Tr at 21).  The father\ndied in 1977.  His mother stayed in South Korea because of her family, but she never felt like she\nwas Korean (Tr at 27).  She \u201cis proud about Japan\u201d (Tr at 48).  She lives in her own home.  For some\nyears, she taught Japanese in Korean schools.  Applicant sends her about $300.00 per month\n1.b. - In 2002,  Applicant purchased an apartment in South Korea for his mother. It is worth\n\n3\nabout $120,000, but his share in it is about $50,000, which he what he put down on the purchase.\nUnder South Korean law, the tenant owns the rest (Tr at 24).  His mother never moved in and the\nproperty has been for sale since 2006.  It is currently being rented to a third party (Tr at 16).  His\nmother continues to live in the same house she has had for many years.  It is worth about $150,000,\nand Applicant has no idea what part of that might come to him when she does pass away (Tr at 31).\n1.c. - Applicant traveled to South Korea in August 2000, to introduce his new wife to his\nmother, December 2001, May 2002, and May 2005, when he took his new granddaughter to meet\nher great-grandmother (Tr at 26). \nApplicant was born in South Korea in March 1948  to a Korean father and a Japanese mother.\nApplicant attended college in South Korea from 1968-1974, during which period he also served in\nthe South Korean Air Force (1971-1973).  He then  moved  to the United States (U.S.) in 1977, 30\nyears ago (Tr at 28).  He became a U.S. citizen in 1986 and holds a U.S. passport.  He considers\nhimself to be a U.S. citizen only.  His second (current) wife is also South Korean born, and became\na U.S. citizen in 2006.  His surviving brother is also a naturalized U.S. citizen and works for an\nAmerican state government (Tr at 28).  His adult daughter is married to an American, and one of his\nstepsons is attending a U.S. Military Academy (Tr at 60).  Applicant owns a vacation home in State\nA.  His mother is his only non-American family member (Tr at 60) and, although she resides in\nSouth Korea, she does not consider herself to be Korean, nor does she have any emotional or other\nties to that country.  As noted above, she considers herself to be Japanese (Tr at 61).  She has asked\nthat when she dies, she be cremated and her ashes returned to Japan (Tr at 61)  \nApplicant  has worked for his present employer since November 1986 and has held a DoD\nsecurity clearance for most of that time, with no reported problems.  One of his company\u2019s Deputy\nDirectors, who  has known Applicant for more than 20 years, states the following:\nI have had the pleasure of working with [Applicant] on 3 different government\nprograms over that time span. [Applicant] has always presented himself in a\nprofessional and ethical manner.  He has exhibited extreme . . . dedication and\nintegrity in his work.  He is always striving for excellence and has been a key\nindividual in every product team he has been part of.  [Applicant] holds his\ncitizenship in the highest regard and, in my many years working with him, I have\nseen no evidence otherwise.  He is one of the best engineers I have had the pleasure\nof working with and is a model citizen (AX A). \nAccording to Applicant, he already held a DoD Secret level clearance, and the present  matter\narose when his employer requested a Top Secret clearance for him (Tr at 19). \nPOLICIES\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\n\n4\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d Viewed in an overall\ncontext, under E2.2.3.of the Directive, the ultimate determination of whether the granting or\ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful consideration of the\nfollowing, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. Explained further\nbelow (emphasis added):  \nThe Whole Person Concept: Under E2.2.1., the DoD adjudicative process is an examination\nof a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. The adjudicative process is the careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the\nfollowing factors: 1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 2. The circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; 3. The frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; 4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 5. The voluntariness of\nparticipation; 6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n7. The motivation for the conduct; 8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand 9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Under the section of the Directive, the totality\nof the evidence compels a decision favorable to Applicant.\nCONCLUSIONS \nThe SOR in this case was issued on October 27, 2006.  Therefore, the present version of the\nDirective, applicable to cases where the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, is controlling.  \nThe SOR alleges concerns only under Guideline B and, as the allegations are worded, the\nGovernment\u2019s  concerns focus on the presence in South Korea of Applicant\u2019s 87 year old mother.\nThe SOR, at 1.a., cites the mother as being a resident of South Korea, although a citizen of Japan.\nI note that the substance of all 10 Official Notice (ON) documents focus on South Korea, with Japan\nbeing mentioned only peripherally in ON V.  Although Department Counsel mentions the mother\u2019s\n\n5\nJapanese citizenship, it is clearly the mother\u2019s residence in South Korea that is of primary concern\n(Tr at 62).  Considering the totality of the evidence, this focus is misplaced, since the elderly and\nailing mother does not consider herself to be South Korean, is clearly not dedicated to the interests\nof that country, and is not likely to ask Applicant do anything to help that country.  She clearly\nconsiders herself to be Japanese, yet that relationship is not cited or argued to be of security concern.\nApplicant has described his mother in the strongest possible terms as a woman of honor, who\nwould kill herself rather than ask her son to act dishonorably. Moreover, even assuming that she\nmight ask Applicant to act in some way against U.S. security interests, the evidence is both\noverwhelming and compelling that Applicant would instinctively act to protect his adopted country\nand appropriately refuse to do so.  Instead, he would immediately report the contact to his company\nsecurity officer.    \nIn contrast to the Government\u2019s real but abstract concerns that Applicant might be asked and\nmight agree to act improperly, the overwhelming bulk of the evidence establishes Applicant as a man\nof honor and dedication to the United States.  He has definitively made himself a part of American\nsociety over a period of 30 years, and has contributed significantly to the  U.S. defense effort for\nsome 20 years, during most of which time he has held a DoD security.  I give considerable weight\nto the high praise he has received from his company leadership superior for his character and\ncontributions.  Nothing appears to have changed in his history of exemplary conduct over many\nyears.  He is not involved in the DOHA adjudication process because of anything he has said or done\nthat might suggest there is any risk he would betray what he has stood for over so many years (Tr\nat 64-66).  America is his home.  \u201cSouth Korea is a foreign country\u201d (Tr at 67).\nThe situation of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his elderly mother, and her self identification\nwith Japan, rather than South Korea, makes this a unique case.  Applicant has only one relative in\nSouth Korea, and that relationship is certainly a close one.  At the same time, his personal,\nemotional, and professional ties to the United States are massive and of long standing.\nThe only reference in the SOR to a relative living in South Korea is to his 87 year old and\nailing mother (Tr at 19-21).  As Applicant points out, if his mother passed away,  he probably would\nnot be in his present predicament, but since she has lived longer, there is a problem (Tr at 20).  His\nmother is \u201cvery high pride lady\u201d and a \u201chighly educated lady\u201d (Tr at 20), but is now \u201cacting more\nlike a child\u201d (Tr at 22). As he describes his mother, she would kill herself rather than embarrass or\ncause problems for her son (Tr at 22, 49, 54, 55).  Applicant also points out the historical reality that\n\u201cKoreans don\u2019t like the Japanese, yes, and the Japanese kind of [look down] on Koreans (Id.).\u201d\nApplicant owns a home in the United States, about $400,000.00 in savings and investments\n(Tr at 51-53), a pension program from his employer and yearly earnings of about $130,00.00 (Tr at\n52).  I have also considered the fact of Applicant\u2019s ownership of an apartment in South Korea, which\nhe is actively seeking to sell, since his mother refuses to move there.  I regard this factor to be of\nlimited significance considering the scale and scope of Applicant\u2019s assets in the United States.  His\nnet worth in the U.S. exceeds $1 million (Tr at 58).  He clearly understands his responsibility to\nreport any contacts to his facility security officer (Tr at 53, 54).  \nAs Department Counsel sees it, the \u201cissue here is the fact that Applicant may be exploited\nthrough his contact with his mom and his property ownership in South Korea because of the concerns\n\n6\nthe Government has with South Korea\u201d (Tr at 63).  Department Counsel fairly represents the\nGovernment\u2019s concerns, but viewed in the context of the entire record and the language of the\nDirective applicable in this case, I am compelled to reach a different conclusion.  \nDisqualifying Conditions include: 7.(a) contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a\ncitizen of or resident in foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  As I read the current language, a\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d can exist based (1) on the identity of the foreign country, (2) the possibility that\nthe foreign relative may be  an agent of a foreign power or susceptible to some form of undue\ninfluence, and (3) the nature of the personal relationship.  At the same time, the language of\nMitigating Condition (MC) 8.(a) has been changed to find evidence mitigating if, despite evidence\nsupporting DC 7.(a), the evidence nevertheless supports the conclusion \u201cit is unlikely the individual\n[Applicant] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interest of the U.S.\u201d (Emphasis  added).\nAs I understand the term \u201cunlikely,\u201d I conclude that DOHA Administrative Judges are being\ninstructed to consider evidence on how the applicant is likely to respond to pressure or persuasion\nof any kind, and whether he would be \u201cforced to choose.\u201d  Nothing Applicant has said or done\nsuggests he would feel forced to choose between his mother and his country.  I conclude he would\nrespond immediately and correctly to protect his country\u2019s interests.       \nOverall, I find Applicants dedication to the United States to be deep and strong enough to\nmake the right decisions when it comes to protecting classified information.  I conclude he has\ndemonstrated the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and is therefore eligible to be\ntrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.\n.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\n\n7\nBARRY M.

We also construe Applicant\u2019s appeal as contending that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Finding no error, we affirm. The Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant failed to file both state and federal income taxes from the mid-1990s until 2004. Applicant also had not filed state and federal taxes for several years during the 1980s. Further, she found: \u201cApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to file taxes was that he is a procrastinator and has a great deal of anxiety and avoidance issues regarding unpleasant tasks. He blames his upbringing and alcoholic parents for emotional issues he developed in avoiding things he does not like . . . He has attended Alcoholics Anonymous and ALANON to help him with his problems.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 19, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),  Guideline\n\n2\nJ (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 29,\n2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made findings of fact that\nwere not supported by record evidence and whether Applicant was denied due process of law.  We\nalso construe Applicant\u2019s appeal as contending that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nwas arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant failed to file both state and federal\nincome taxes from the mid-1990s until 2004.  Applicant also had not filed state and federal taxes for\nseveral years during the 1980s. \n Further, she found:  \u201cApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to file taxes was that he is a\nprocrastinator and has a great deal of anxiety and avoidance issues regarding unpleasant tasks.  He\nblames his upbringing and alcoholic parents for emotional issues he developed in avoiding things\nhe does not like . . . He has attended Alcoholics Anonymous and ALANON to help him with his\nproblems. He has diagnosed himself and believes he has avoidance issues that are related to his\nbackground and caused him not to file his taxes.  He has not confirmed his diagnosis with a mental\nhealth professional.  He has not sought any treatment, other than attending AA and ALANON, for\nhis avoidance issues that he believes caused him to procrastinate [doing] things he does not like.\u201d\nDecision at 4.\n\u201cApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to file his tax returns for two lengthy periods of time are\ncriminal violations of federal law.  He did not withhold enough money from his pay, and because\nhis salary was increasing, so was his tax liability.  He was aware that each of the tax years he failed\nto withhold enough money to cover his tax liability and failed to make any changes during this ten-\nyear span.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \nApplicant was aware of his obligation to pay his taxes and that failure to do so would result\nin penalties.  At the close of the record Applicant still owed $23,000 in overdue taxes.  He has\nentered into an installment agreement with the IRS to pay off the debt.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor\nconsiders him reliable and trustworthy and not a security risk.  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s findings and conclude that they are supported by \u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  To the extent that Applicant\nhas identified matters which he contends to be erroneous, some are harmless clerical errors, such as\nthe Judge\u2019s having improperly identified a Government Exhibit as having been prepared in 2006\nrather than the correct year of 2005.  Other matters appear to be Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nweight the Judge attached to various pieces of evidence rather than challenges to fundamental\naccuracy.  The record provides no basis to conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings are an\nunreasonable or implausible interpretation of the evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 8, 2007).  \n\nTr. at 181.  \n1\n3\nConcerning the due process challenge, we note that, at the hearing, Applicant was represented\nby counsel, who presented documentary evidence and witnesses on his behalf.  Applicant has\ncontended on appeal that the Judge \u201ccut short\u201d testimony which he believed relevant and necessary\nto his case.  We have examined the 202-page transcript of the four-hour hearing, paying especial note\nto those portions which Applicant identifies as exhibiting this alleged tendency by the Judge.  These\ninstances appear to be reasonable efforts by the Judge to clarify the testimony of witnesses rather\nthan to preclude a full and fair presentation of evidence.  We note that Applicant\u2019s attorney, at the\nend of the hearing, advised the Judge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have anything further,\u201d  which buttresses our\n1\nconclusion that Applicant had ample opportunity to present his side of the case.  In light of the record\nas a whole, Applicant has not met his \u201cheavy burden of persuasion\u201d that he was denied the due\nprocess rights secured by the Directive.  See ISCR Case No. 03-14052 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 28,\n2005).  Furthermore, the record does not support Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861\nat 2-3 (App. Bd. June 2, 2006).   \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The\nSOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September\n14, 2006, and elected to have a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on December 15, 2006.  The Notice of Hearing was issued on December 20, 2006.  I convened\na hearing on January 23, 2007.  The government offered thirteen  exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-13.  Applicant offered one exhibit, marked as Exhibit A.  DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 31, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a. through\n1.g.  These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following  findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old supervisor employed by a federal contractor.   He is single and has\n2\nhis two-year-old child living with him.   He is a high school graduate with three years of college\n3\ncredits.   He is an eight-year veteran of the United States Marine Corps, having served from August\n4\n1993 to August 2001.   He was honorably discharged with the rank of Lance Corporal (pay grade E-\n5\n3), and he held a secret security clearance during his Marine Corps service.  \n6\nAs of July 25, 2006, Applicant owed the following debts:7\n1.a. $347 collection account placed February 2001;8\n1.b. $4,596 credit union charged off in April 2003;9\n\nId. \n10\nId. \n11\nId. \n12\nId. \n13\nId. \n14\n Statement of Reasons at 1-2.\n15\nTr. at 17-20.\n16\nTr. at 40;  Government Exhibit 4 (Interrogatory Response, dated January 24, 2006) at 2-3. \n17\nId.  at 40.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Bankruptcy Court Records, dated December 7, 2006) at 1-11.\n19\n4\n1.c. $395 collection account placed in June 2003;10\n1.d. $463 credit union charged off in January 2005;11\n1.e. $6,412 credit union charged off in November 2004;12\n1.f. $153 collection account placed in March 2001;  and\n13\n1.g. $372 collection account placed in June 1999.  \n14\nApplicant accumulated seven unpaid debts totaling about $12,638.  Two debts totaling\n$11,000 were charged off in April 2003 and November 2004.  The remaining five  debts, all less than\n$500,  were placed for collection between June 1999 and January 2005.   \n15\nAfter his discharge from the Marine Corps, Applicant had inconsistent employment.  He did\ncontract work as an electrical helper working for an uncle.  He also was attending college.  In April\n2002, he was employed by a federal credit union.  He left that employment in August 2003, and\ncommenced employment with his present employer in March 2004.16\nWhile in college, Applicant took out approximately $56,000 in student loans, with repayment\ndeferred while in school.  He intends to attend school indefinitely to postpone repayment as long as\npossible.   in the meantime, he purchased a used car requiring payments of $600 per month for the\n17\nnext six years.18\nOn December 5, 2006, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 petition in bankruptcy.   At the time of\n19\nthis hearing, the bankruptcy discharge hearing had not been scheduled.  Assuming that the\n\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523 (8).\n20\nTr. at 54. \n21\nGuidelines \u00b6 2. \n22\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n23\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n24\n5\nbankruptcy petition is upheld, the debts listed in the SOR would be discharged.  The student loan\ndebts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.20\nPrior to filing bankruptcy, Applicant had not sought any financial counseling.  The\nbankruptcy court required him to attend two financial management courses, which he completed.\nHe had not prepared a budget.21\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each Guidelines, the Guidelines are\ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.   An administrative judge\u2019s over-\n22\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process\nis a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an\nadministrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.23\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n24\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n25\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n26\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n27\n6\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n25\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.26\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the Guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n27\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n28\n7\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in payments on numerous\naccounts, and he has made no payments on his student loans.  \nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The\nDirective sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation).  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts started accumulating after his discharge from the Marine\nCorps, due to spotty employment.  He had periods of unemployment in 2001-2002, and 2003-2004.\nThese events were beyond his control.  But he did work for an uncle\u2019s construction company so he\nwas not destitute.  However, several of these debts were only a few hundred dollars, and he made\nno effort to pay on any of them.  He gave no cogent reason why he paid nothing.  He was not\nrequired to repay his student loans and he has not made any payments.  Thus mitigating condition\nE2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.  \nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nEven though he has recently attended two financial management courses as directed by the\nbankruptcy court, Applicant did not seek counseling in the past, and even after attending these two\ncourses, he has not prepared a budget.  As discussed below, he does not have his financial affairs\nunder control.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve bad debts) is not applicable.  There is no evidence as to why he could pay\nnothing on the smaller debts, notwithstanding periods of unemployment.  He was not totally\nunemployed as he worked for an uncle\u2019s construction business.  Filing bankruptcy a month before\nthe hearing might be evidence of debt resolution, but not in this instance.  Three collection accounts\npreceded his discharge from the Marine Corps, so his financial problems were not caused by\nunemployment, but exacerbated by it.  In addition, he took on substantial new debt with his\neducational loans, with no plan for repayment.  They are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  He has\ncontinued to defer the loan repayments by staying in school, and stated he intended to stay in school\nuntil such time he could afford a monthly payment.  He is operating at a deficit now.  He recently\ncommitted to a $600 per month car payment, payable over six years.  He waited until after the SOR\nwas filed to make any effort at debt resolution.  His student loans are problematic as at some point\nhe must commence payment.  He can\u2019t afford to make payments now, and by continuing in school\nand borrowing more money, he is only compounding his financial problems.  I conclude Guideline\nF against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n28\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\n\nId.\n29\nId.\n30\n8\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\n29\nI also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.   I considered his age (31), his education, his marine corps service,\n30\nthe causes of his financial problems, and the reasons he gave for not making progress on debt\nrepayment.  Applicant made no progress in reducing his debt.  He waited until one month before the\nhearing to file bankruptcy.  He has a sizable student loan, has made no payments on it, is continuing\nto attend school, and thus will increase his borrowing and indebtedness.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDrew S. Pinkerton, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 9, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\n\n2\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On October 31, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge James\nA. Young denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether some of the Judge\u2019s factual findings\nare not supported by substantial evidence; whether the Judge erred by not mitigating the security\nconcerns raised in the SOR; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis fails to comply with the\nrequirements of Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1.  Finding no error, we affirm. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings: Applicant obtained a security clearance\nupon  joining the Air Force in 1981.  He left active duty in 1985, at which time he went to work for\na Department of Defense contractor and was again granted a secret clearance.  \nApplicant has used alcohol \u201cto excess and to the point of intoxication\u201d from 1973 until 2003.\nIn June 1993 he crashed his car into a tree during an episode of drunken driving.  He later advised\nthe police that his car had been stolen, and he filed a false insurance claim.  He was eventually\narrested and charged with DUI, filing a false police report, and insurance fraud.  Convicted of DUI,\nhe pled nolo contedere to the other charges.  Withholding adjudication of guilt, the court placed him\non probation for a year, ordered him neither to use nor possess alcohol and to attend a drunk drivers\ncourse.\nIn 1996, Applicant was charged with DUI and with speeding.  Convicted of DUI, he was\nsentenced to 10 days in jail, a fine of $741, and community service.  The court also placed him on\none year\u2019s probation and suspended his drivers license for five years.  In 2001, Applicant was again\narrested and charged with DUI.  He was also charged with driving with a suspended license and\nfailure to use a designated lane.  Entering a plea of nolo contendere he was convicted and sentenced\nto 30 days in jail, a fine of $1,321, and one year\u2019s probation.  The court required him to attend\n\u201cmultiple DUI schools\u201d and a victim impact course and to perform community service.  The court\nrevoked Applicant\u2019s drivers license for 10 years.  In 2002, Applicant entered a rehabilitation center\nafter having been given a choice of treatment or jail.  During this treatment he admitted to going on\ndrinking binges.  He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and was sober for only 2 or 3 months\nfollowing treatment.  \n  \nIn May 2003, Applicant was again arrested and charged with DUI, as well as with refusal to\nsubmit to a test for alcohol and for driving under a suspended license.  He was convicted of this last\ncharge, the other two being dismissed.  The Judge found that Applicant was \u201ccourt ordered for\ntreatment.\u201d  Applicant entered an inpatient treatment and rehabilitation program, where he was\ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence and polysubstance abuse.  Applicant admitted to having misused\nprescription medication\u2013MScotin, Morphine, Xanax, and Oxycotin.  These had been prescribed for\nhim as analgesics following a broken ankle and leg.  Prior to entering the rehabilitation program,\nApplicant advised his supervisor about his problems.  The facility security officer subsequently\ndiscovered Applicant\u2019s prior arrests, which he had failed to report as required by the National\nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual.\n\nAn acquittal is a Guideline J mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6  E2.A10.1.3.6.\n1\nParagraph 2g states, \u201cYou illegally used controlled substances while holding a Secret Department of Defense\n2\nIndustrial Security Clearance granted in December 1985.\u201d  Paragraph 4c repeats that allegation as a Guideline E security\nconcern.  \n3\nIn addition to his DUIs and other related misconduct, Applicant was arrested in 2001 and\ncharged with possession of a controlled substance (a felony) and possession of narcotic equipment.\nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend drove her car, with Applicant as a passenger, to a drug dealer where she\npurchased cocaine.  Applicant was drunk at the time.  The police found cocaine in the car.  Police\nobtained a warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest for violating the terms of his parole.  Charges against\nApplicant were nolle prossed after Applicant agreed to attend a rehabilitation program.       \nThe Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s brother and fianc\u00e9 spend a considerable amount of time\nwith him, both testifying that Applicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous regularly.  They both\ncorroborated Applicant\u2019s sobriety in the years between his last DUI and the date of the hearing.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant took issue with what he termed factual conclusions of the\nJudge.  Many of these issues are more properly characterized as disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\napplication of mitigating conditions and with his whole person analysis, which will be discussed\nbelow.  However, we have identified several challenges to the Judge\u2019s factual findings in Applicant\u2019s\nbrief.  First, he disagrees with the Judge\u2019s statement in his Conclusions section that Applicant had\nnot been acquitted of any of his charged criminal conduct.   We have examined the Judge\u2019s findings\n1\nin light of the record evidence and conclude that Applicant\u2019s allegation is without basis.  While some\nof Applicant\u2019s charges were disposed of without trial, we have discovered none in the record which\nresulted in a formal acquittal.  \nSecond, Applicant alleges that the Judge erred by finding that Applicant had admitted to\nhaving engaged in the illegal use of prescription medications.  This finding formed the basis of the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision concerning paragraphs 2g and 4c of the SOR.   However, in his response\n2\nto the SOR, Applicant stated that \u201cI have abused drugs that were lawfully and legally prescribed to\nme.  I did not take them in accordance with their prescribed usage.  However, I had them legally and\ndid not acquire them illegally.\u201d  (emphasis added)  The highlighted sentences clearly admit to the\nmisuse of drugs which were lawfully prescribed to Applicant. Additionally, Applicant admitted that\nhe abused prescription drugs,  both elsewhere in his response to the SOR and during the hearing.\nTr at 51.  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s own statements support the challenged finding.  \n\nStatements made for the purpose of a medical diagnosis are sufficiently trustworthy to constitute an exception\n3\nto the hearsay rule.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(4).  This exception \u201cis predicated on the notion that people are motivated\nto tell the truth to a physician who is going to . . . treat them, to avoid adverse health consequences.\u201d  Paul Rothstein,\nFederal Rules of Evidence at 553 (2007).  The Federal Rules of Evidence serve as a guide in DOHA hearings.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.19. \nSee Mitigating Condition 1 under Guideline E, \u201cThe information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a\n4\ndetermination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.\u201d  Directive \u00b6  D2A5.1.3.1.\nTo the extent that challenges to the Judge\u2019s factual findings, other than those discussed above, are implicit in\n5\nApplicant\u2019s second and third allegations of error, we have considered all the record evidence and resolve those challenges\nadversely to Applicant. \n4\nFinally, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that, following his 2003 arrest for\n DUI, the court ordered him to undergo treatment.  Applicant contends that he entered into treatment\nvoluntarily.  However, Government Exhibit 5, medical notes from Applicant\u2019s treatment facility,\ndated June 2003, contains the following comment: \u201c[Applicant] states that he is \u2018court-ordered to\ntreatment for a DUI charge on 4/24/03.\u2019\u201d    Therefore, the Judge did not err in his finding as to this\n3\nmatter.  Accordingly, after considering the record as a whole, we conclude that the challenged\nfindings are supported by substantial record evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 02-04455 at 4-5 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2003).  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).  \nOur review of the Judge\u2019s decision leads to the conclusion that he gave explicit consideration\nto all mitigating conditions which were plausibly raised by the evidence, finding in Applicant\u2019s favor\non two allegations under Guideline E, which alleged false statements on the security clearance\napplication.   Nevertheless, the Judge found against Applicant on all four Guidelines.  Given the\n4\nJudge\u2019s findings as described above, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s application of the Guidelines G,\nH, J, and E mitigating conditions was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   \n5\n\n5\nNeither are we able to agree that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is defective.  He gave\nweight to Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, such as his recent sobriety and excellent work record.\nHowever, the Judge balanced that against the record evidence establishing, inter alia, (1) Applicant\u2019s\nextensive alcohol-related criminal misconduct; (2) the fact that, while intoxicated, Applicant\naccompanied a woman as she purchased cocaine; and (3) Applicant\u2019s failure to remain sober after\ncompleting his first alcohol rehabilitation program.  The Judge also noted that Applicant still suffers\nfrom the pain which underlay his addiction to prescription drugs, raising the possibility of future\ndrug misuse.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements\nof Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching\nhis decision.  See ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  In light of the foregoing,\nwe conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Jean E.

Applicant still owes $289 to the Internal Revenue Service and $900\n13\nto a state taxing authority for calendar year 2002. \nPOLICIES\n\u201cNo one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d   As Commander in Chief, the President has\n14\n\u201cthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether\nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such\ninformation.\u201d   The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\n15\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d   Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial\n16\ncommon sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information\nand the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy.\u201d   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n17\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d18\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating\nthe security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative\n\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n19\n \nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n20\nId.\n21\n5\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the\napplicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that\nthe circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n19\nan indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (A history of not meeting financial obligations)  and\nFC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are applicable.  The available\ninformation demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has\nbeen delinquent in payments on numerous accounts, had multiple judgments, and lived beyond his\nmeans.  He provided no evidence on his own behalf.  The disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The\nDirective sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation).  Applicant provided no evidence as to the cause or causes of his delinquent debts, nor\na reason why he has made no effort to resolve indebtedness.  This mitigating condition is not\napplicable.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does\nnot apply as there is no evidence of Applicant seeking financial counseling.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6.\n(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve bad\ndebts) is not applicable.  He was given an opportunity to provide documentation of efforts to resolve\nhis financial difficulties.  He chose not to respond.  Absent sufficient evidence to determine if\nmitigating conditions are applicable, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n20\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n21\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\n\nId.\n22\n6\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (48),\n22\nhis employment, and what might cause him to be in continual financial distress.  He has had a ten-\nyear history of financial delinquencies, including numerous judgements, unpaid taxes, filing two\nbankruptcies, and he failed to present any evidence showing why he incurred delinquent debts\nbetween 2000 and 2005, other than to say that he financially overextended himself more than once\nor twice.  That is an understatement.  The past being prologue, the risk is substantial that Applicant\nwill once again find himself in financial exigency.  While filing bankruptcy can be a mitigating\ncondition of resolving debt, the record contains insufficient evidence so that the underlying reasons\nfor his delinquent obligations can only be conjecture.  Therefore, the totality of the record leads me\nto conclude that Applicant does not have the ability nor responsibility to protect classified\ninformation and cannot exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom\nthe government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mason\n\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\n1\nTranscript at 5.\n2\nTranscript at 5-8.\n3\nTranscript at 8.\n4\n2\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that she was denied due process because she did not receive 15 days\nadvance notice of the time and place of the hearing, and that she felt pressured to go ahead with the\nhearing anyway.  In support of this argument, she contends that she was unaware of the 15 day notice\nrequirement prior to arriving at the hearing, and had she known about it, \u201c[she] could have done\nmore for [her] case.\u201d1\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.8 states that an \u201capplicant shall be notified at least 15 days in advance of the\ntime and place of the hearing . . .\u201d  The Directive does not specify the form that notice must take.\nAlthough the 15 day notice requirement is important, the Board has previously noted that an\napplicant may waive that requirement.  See ISCR Case No. 04-12732 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006).\nIn this case, the date on the Notice of Hearing was August 14, 2006, and the hearing was held\non August 30, 2006.  At the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel brought those facts to the\nattention of the Judge, and acknowledged that as a practical matter Applicant could not have received\nthe Notice of Hearing more than 15 days in advance of the hearing.  However, Department Counsel\nalso informed the Judge that he had verbally advised Applicant of the hearing date in late July or\nearly August of 2006, suggesting that Applicant had more than 15 days of actual notice as to the\nhearing date.   At that point, the Judge examined the relevant documents, gave the Applicant an\n2\nextensive explanation of the 15 day notice requirement, and concluded that insofar as the written\nNotice of Hearing was concerned, it was in \u201ctechnical violation\u201d of \u00b6 E3.1.8.   \n3\nThe Judge then asked Applicant if she recalled being verbally advised of the hearing date by\nDepartment Counsel.  Applicant answered that she did, and confirmed that the conversation took\nplace \u201ctowards the last part of July.\u201d  In response to further questioning by the Judge, Applicant\nacknowledged she had been \u201cinformed\u201d of and was \u201caware\u201d of the \u201cupcoming hearing more than 15\ndays in advance of [the date].\u201d   At that juncture, the Judge asked Applicant if she was willing to\n4\nwaive the 15 day notice requirement and proceed with the hearing.  Applicant answered in the\naffirmative.  The relevant portion of the transcript is as follows:\nJUDGE: Okay.  So my question is, do you waive - which means do you give up - to\nyou relinquish your right to have a hearing 15 days out from when you\u2019re told of\nwhen the hearing is to occur?\n\nTranscript at 9.\n5\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR paragraph 1.a.  That favorable finding is not at issue\n6\non appeal.\n3\nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir, I waive that.\nJUDGE: Okay.  Now, do you understand what I\u2019ve said?\nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir.\nJUDGE: All right.  Well, that means we\u2019re going to go forward with the hearing\ntoday.  And you don\u2019t have a problem, even though technically you didn\u2019t receive the\nNotice of Hearing on time?\nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir.\nJUDGE: Okay.  I am satisfied that you understand the basis of your waiver and that\nyou have waived you right to a 15-day period.5\nAfter reviewing the record in this case, the Board concludes that Applicant was reasonably\nprovided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that\nthe Judge conducted the hearing in a professional manner, consistent with his role as an impartial\npresiding official.  The Judge diligently inquired into the issues of notice and waiver.  Based upon\nthe representations he received from  Applicant, he reasonably concluded that Applicant was making\na knowing and intelligent waiver of the 15 days notice requirement, and was ready and willing to\nproceed with the hearing. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. July 24, 2006);\nCompare ISCR Case No. 04-12732 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006).  \nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that\nfailure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6\n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2001).  Because Applicant did not object to proceeding or otherwise request a\ncontinuance of her case, she was not denied due process under the Directive or Executive Order.  \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination should be\nreversed because Applicant has acknowledged responsibility for her debts, taken responsible action\nto prevent a recurrence of her debt problems in the future, and will keep looking into credit agencies\nthat she can afford.   Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge. \n6\nApplicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe financial considerations allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly\ndisagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, she has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\n\n4\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\nunpaid debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect\nto one of the allegations in the SOR.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not fully\napplying any mitigating conditions in this case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which\nthe Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\ntrustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence\ncited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record\nthat was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under\nGuidelines F is sustainable.  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness\ndesignation.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nUnder FIMC 1, an applicant must show that his or her foreign relatives are neither agents of\na foreign power nor in a position to be exploited by a foreign power, in this case Iran. The Judge\nnoted that Applicant has resisted efforts by the Iranian government to force her to relinquish her U.S.\ncitizenship, demonstrating her ability to stand up to pressure.  She also noted that Applicant\u2019s father\nhas no ties to the Iranian government, and Applicant herself has long standing ties to the U.S., having\nbeen born in this country.  The Judge concluded that these matters demonstrate that Applicant is not\nsusceptible to exploitation.\nOn the other hand, Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis did not give\nsufficient attention to the repressive nature  of the Iranian regime and its hostility to the U.S., which\n2\nevidence both the willingness and the motive for Iran to use Applicant\u2019s father as a means of\ncoercion.  We find merit in Department Counsel\u2019s argument.  Neither the Judge\u2019s findings nor the\nrecord provide a reasonable basis to conclude that Applicant\u2019s father is not someone through whom\nApplicant could be coerced.  This is especially true in light of the findings and the record evidence\nthat Applicant\u2019s family has been targeted by the regime in the recent past.  We conclude that the\nrecord evidence does not sustain the conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion on\nFIMC 1.\n\n4\nDepartment Counsel has also challenged the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion under FIMC 3,\nwhich requires a showing that contacts with foreign relatives are casual and infrequent in order to\nmitigate Guideline B security concerns.   Again, Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit, in light\nof record evidence that Applicant communicates with her father monthly and at significant times of\nthe year, such as the New Year.  Tr. at 89.  See ISCR Case No. 04-11369 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 16,\n2007) (Monthly communication with a foreign relative not casual or infrequent.)  Given the evidence\nin this case, the Judge erred in her favorable application of FIMC 3.  \nWe have considered the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis, which takes into account Applicant\u2019s\nU.S. ties, her relative lack of Iranian assets, and her good work performance.  The Judge also\nconsidered  Applicant\u2019s ability to resist pressure.  On the other hand, Department Counsel argues that\nthe Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is impaired by the same legal infirmity as her treatment of FIMC\n1, that she did not properly evaluate Applicant\u2019s potential for being coerced through her Iranian\nfather.  We find Department Counsel\u2019s argument to be meritorious.  As stated above, there is\nconsiderable record evidence outlining the extent to which Applicant\u2019s family has been targeted by\nthe Iranian regime, evidence which raises serious concerns about the ease with which Applicant\u2019s\nIranian family members, and through them Applicant herself, could come to the attention of a\ngovernment which monitors residents\u2019 telephone conversations, opens their mail, enters their homes,\nand conducts other kinds of domestic surveillance.  An applicant with close family members residing\nin a country hostile to the U.S. bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to demonstrate that it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security for him or her to have a clearance.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n26893 at 10 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  Despite the evidence submitted by Applicant we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s favorable whole person analysis is not sustainable on this record.  To the extent that\nthis is a close case, it \u201cshould be resolved in the favor of national security, rather than in the favor\nof the Applicant.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 03-23190 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.12, 2007) (internal citations\nomitted).\nIn her reply brief, Applicant contends that the Board should base its decision on the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines rather than the Directive\u2019s Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Guidelines.  The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines were circulated to agencies involved in security clearance\ndeterminations after December 29, 2005.  They were implemented by the Department of Defense\nin a memo dated August 30, 2006, for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The SOR in\nApplicant\u2019s case was issued on February 10, 2006.  The Judge based her decision on the\nAdjudicative Guidelines in effect at that time.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov.\n14, 2006).\nApplicant is essentially challenging the implementation of the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines by the Under Secretary of Defense.  The Board\u2019s jurisdiction and authority are limited\nto reviewing security clearance decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges.  See Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28-E3.1.35.  Nothing in the Directive gives the Board the jurisdiction or authority to pass\njudgment on the wisdom or desirability of guidance provided by the Under Secretary of Defense.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 5 (App. Bd.  Jan. 3, 2001).  \n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin               \nJean E.

Under a whole person analysis she also mitigated foreign influence security concerns over\nher bonds to her father who is a citizen of Iran and resides there.  Applicant has strong ties to the\nU.S. She was born in the U.S.,  resided in the U.S. as a child and during her high school and college\nyears.  Her work and professional ties are exclusively in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s assurances that she\nwould contact appropriate U.S. officials if any foreign influence pressure were to be attempted are\ncredible.  Her supervisors and others praise her exemplary work as well as her loyalty and\ntrustworthiness.  She had no intent to willfully falsify by an omission on her security clearance\napplication, so personal conduct concerns not longer continue.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)1\nto the Applicant on February 10, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nfind that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information.\nThe SOR alleges specific concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign influence (Guideline B),  in paragraph\n2 over foreign preference  (Guideline C), and in paragraph 3 over personal conduct  (Guideline E).\n2\n3\nApplicant replied to the SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on February 27, 2006, where she\nrequested a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel stated the case was ready to proceed on August 15, 2006.  The case was\nassigned initially to another judge on August 23, 2006, and re-assigned to me on that day.  Applicant\nretained counsel who entered her appearance on September 15, 2006.  On October 19, 2006, DOHA\nissued a Notice of Hearing and set this case to be heard on November 16, 2006, in a city near where\nApplicant lives and works.  At the hearing the government presented one exhibit (Exhibit 1) which\nwas admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel's request that administrative\nnotice (AN) be taken of the information contained in Exhibits I - VI was granted as Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel did not object.  (TRR 18)  Applicant\u2019s counsel called two witnesses and offered twenty-six\nexhibits (Exhibits A-Z) which were admitted into evidence without objection.  (TRR 20-29)\nProcedural Issue:  \u201cOld\u201d Guidelines vs.\u201cRevised\u201d Effective Date \nSubsequently, there was a discussion over whether the \u201cOld\u201d Guidelines or the \u201cRevised\u201d\n\n       The Annotated version of Notice of Filing of Transcript Errata used the code T = transcript stands as\n4\nsubmitted where there was no error; E = proposed change is accepted; they also used \u201cE\u201d to indicate changes\nthat were warranted, but not the change proposed by counsel.  He instructed us to discard the earlier version\nof the transcript (TR1).  (Neal R. Gross & Co., Inc. Letter of 1/29/07)\n       I note that there are still errors in the TRR.  Also, page 83 reflects that the recording cut off after 45:02\n5\non part 3, so it is possible that some testimony of Applicant was not transcribed.  Some of the obvious\nremaining errors I have corrected by pen and ink and initialed: e.g. page 15, line 21: \u201cour\u201d should be \u201cher\u201d;\npage 107, line 12 of the government\u2019s argument, \u201cundue\u201d should be \u201cundo.\u201d Also, page 109, line 24, \u201cIraq\u201d\nshould be \u201cIran.\u201d  Although Department Counsel raised some objections to further proposed TRR changes,\nfor clarity in the closing argument I concur with the following suggested changes and have amended the TRR\nby pen and initialed Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s suggested changes to her closing argument, and other errors:  \npage 111, line 13: \u201cFord\u201d should be \u201cBoard\u201d and on line 15 \u201cnecrate\u201d should be \u201cconcrete\u201d; \npage 112, line 11: \u201cIranian\u201d should be \u201cAmerican\u201d;\npage 117, line 5: \u201cseek\u201d should be \u201cspeak\u201d;\npage 119, line 12: \u201cproper\u201d should be \u201ca proffer\u201d;\n3\nor \u201cNew\u201d guidelines apply to this matter as the SOR was issued on February 10, 2006.  This SOR\ndate is  after the White House issued the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines on December 29, 2005,\nwith guidance that they be circulated for \u201cimmediate implementation\u201d but with no effective date\nindicated (AN VIII), but prior to September 1, 2006, when the Undersecretary of Defense (DoD)\nissued a memorandum stating the \u201crevised Guidelines apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations in which a Statement of Reasons has not been issued by September 1, 2006.\u201d  (AN\nVII)   Department Counsel argued that DOHA has a policy to apply the \u201cRevised\u201d guidelines only\nto cases where the SOR was issued on September 1, 2006, and thereafter. (AN VII) Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel argued that the \u201cNew\u201d guidelines should be effective and should have been implemented\nby agencies immediately after they were issued and approved by the President on December 29,\n2005.  (AN VIII & IX)   Consequently, Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s Counsel each made an\noffer that Exhibits VII to IX be accepted also for Administrative Notice which I granted, so that this\nlegal issue could be addressed.  (TRR 126-136) Although Applicant\u2019s Counsel makes a rational\nargument, I conclude I am bound by DoD policy guidance.  Therefore, I will apply the \u201cold\u201d\nadjudication guidelines. \nProcedural Issue: Transcript Errors\nThe initial transcript (TR1) was received on December 8, 2006. Subsequently, Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel protested the accuracy of the transcription (TR1) in a Notice of Filing of Transcript Errata,\nwhich she submitted on January 22, 2007.  After I received it on January 25, 2007, I immediately\nforwarded her concerns to the company that prepare\u2019s DOHA\u2019s official transcripts for their review.\nIn a subsequent discussion on e-mail, the Department Counsel agreed to some changes for accuracy,\nbut expressed a caution that some suggested changes were editorial changes, not simply errors.  \nSubsequently, the court reporting firm agreed to review the tapes of the hearing and issue a\nnew official, revised transcript (TRR) which they completed on January 29, 2007, and sent to all\nparties along with an annotated  version of the Notice of Filing of Transcript Errata as to which\n4\nchanges were made or rejected.  I received TRR on February 2, 2007.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel filed a\nSupplemental Notice of Filing of Transcript Errata on January 30, 2007, and requested sixteen (16)\nadditional changes to the TRR to words in her closing  argument. Despite the Department Counsel\u2019s\n5\n\npage 120, line 22: \u201cinsist\u201d should be \u201cassist\u201d;\npage 122, line 14: \u201caccounted\u201d should be \u201cencountered\u201d and line 18 \u201csuppressive\u201d should be \u201crepressive\u201d;\nline 19 \u201cApplicant\u2019s successful resist\u201d should be \u201cApplicant would successfully resist\u201d; \npage 127, line 7: \u201cExhibit Roman Numeral VI seven\u201d should be \u201cExhibit Roman Numeral VII seven\u201d;\npage 130, line 24: \u201cray\u201d should be \u201cRE\u201d;\npage 133, line 19: \u201cdeparts her de-process\u201d should be \u201cdeprives her of due process\u201d;\npage 134; line 11: \u201cdo\u201d should be \u201cignore.\u201d\n4\nconcerns over the suggested changes, I amended the TRR to clarify and correct the TRR, including\nparts of the closing arguments of both parties.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 43 years old, is a business analyst who has worked for a defense contractor\n(Employer #1) in State #1 since November 2004.  On November 12, 2004 she completed a Security\nClearance Application (Standard Form 86).  She currently is limited to unclassified work as she has\nno clearance.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; Exhibit G; TRR 66-68; 99) She previously had a security\nclearance from the U.S. Department of State when she worked for another contractor.  (TR 66-67,\n84; Exhibits L, M, N)\nApplicant attended university in State #2 in 2000 to 2001.  She is now studying for a master\u2019s\ndegree in computer science.  She earlier attended a U.S. high school in State #3, and graduated in\n1981.  She then attended college in State #3 and received a degree in 1985.  (Exhibit 1; TRR 61, 66;\n83-84)\nPersonal Conduct\nIn 1992 she went to Iran to see her father after his stroke.  During that stay she was officially\nengaged to an Iranian citizen whom she had met in the U.S., but the relationship was later annulled.\nShe lived with his parents in Iran for a month and found out he was a deceitful person.  Her mother\ncame and \u201crescued\u201d her.  She then lived with her grandmother and later with her father.  Until she\nwas free of her legal bounds to her fianc\u00e9, she could not leave Iran because she was \u201caffiliated\u201d to\nhim and because her American passport had expired.  She remained for approximately three years\n(Answer; TRR 51, 68-73; 91-94)\nApplicant denied any attempt to falsify when she completed her SF 86 in 2004.  While she\ndid not disclose that she had been married, she argued that legally it was not a marriage as the\nrelationship was annulled, and she had no subsequent contact.  (Answer; TR 79-80)  Applicant\nestablished credibly that she had no intent to falsify the form. She earlier had provided a supplement\nto her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position in January 2003 which disclosed this relationship\nwhich began with an \u201cofficial\u201d engagement in December 1992; the \u201cofficial\u201d relationship ended in\nJuly 1993.  (Answer; Exhibit Z)\n \nForeign Preference and Foreign Influence \n\n       No security concern is raised in the SOR over Applicant\u2019s grandmother.\n6\n5\nApplicant is a United States (U.S.) citizen who was born in the U.S. in State #4 while her\nfather was teaching at a U.S. university and had a U.S. green card.  Applicant was also considered\nan Iranian citizen by virtue of her father\u2019s Iranian citizenship under the laws of Iran.  (Exhibit 1; TRR\n50) She lived in the U.S. until she was four years old when her family returned to Iran.  She and her\nfamily returned to the U.S. in 1979 when she was 15 because under the policies of the Islamic\nrevolution and subsequent government educational opportunities for women were limited.  (TRR\n51, 55-56, 60)   \nWhen she was 18, the Iranian government \u201cinsisted\u201d that she give up her U.S. citizenship as\nthey would no longer accept her dual citizenship and required any student who wanted financial aid\nfrom Iran to have a U.S. visa in an Iranian passport.  As a U.S. citizen, Applicant could not obtain\na U.S. visa in her Iranian passport. Despite this pressure from the Iranian government, she resisted.\nInstead, she chose to maintain her U.S. citizenship and declare herself financially independent at age\n18, so she could apply for financial aid and support herself in college.  (TRR 62-66; 98; See Exhibit\nF)\nApplicant\u2019s mother, initially a citizen of Iran, has now become a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nJune 2005 and resides with Applicant in State #1.  (Exhibit A; TRR 51; 87) Applicant\u2019s father and\ngrandmother  remain in Iran. However, she provides no financial support for them. Applicant has\n6\nno friends in Iran. She owns no property in Iran.  (TRR 54-55)\n\u2022\nHer grandmother is 87 and has never been employed; she cannot leave Iran as she is\ndisabled; she has been diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease and paralysis.\nApplicant calls her occasionally to inquire about her health.  (Exhibit D; TRR 52, 54; 90-91)\n\u2022\nApplicant\u2019s father is 71 and has a degree from a U.S. university in civil and mechanical\nengineering; he was a professor and is now retired.  He never worked for the government of\nIran and was not active politically.  He is now in poor health as he had a stroke in the 1990s\nand one again in 2004.  His speech is now impaired, so she cannot understand what he says.\nHe is too ill to travel.  (Exhibit C; TRR 53-54, 60; 86-87, 89)   Even though her father was\nill in 2004, she chose not to go to Iran and visit him for several reasons, including that she\ndid not want to raise U.S. security concerns by travel to Iran.  (TRR 77-78)  Applicant only\nhas short conversations monthly with her father where she asks about his health.  (TR 88-89)\nHe has been diagnosed with CVA (cerebrovascular accident) and low level of consciousness\nby his medical doctor in Iran. (Exhibit C)\nApplicant returned to Iran twice \u2013 in 1992 and 2000. After the laws were changed in Iran for\nIranian exiles in 1991, she could again get an Iranian passport in order to travel to Iran.  She entered\nand left Iran on her Iranian passport  (TRR 51, 74-77)  In 2000 she got a new Iranian passport and\nwent to see her father for three weeks.  (TRR 74-76) She now has relinquished her expired Iranian\npassport to the Pakistan Embassy.  (Exhibit Y; TRR 95-96)  She has no intent to exercise any rights\nof her Iranian citizenship since she surrendered her passport.  (TRR 99) She has no present intention\nto return to Iran to visit.  (TRR 77-78)  \n\n6\nApplicant considers herself an American and feels no ties to the Islamic Republic of Iran. If\nshe were very approached by an Iranian agent, she would inform U.S. authorities. (TRR 81-82) She\nfeels no allegiance to the Islamic Republic of Iran. (TRR 83) She testified she believed that the\nrepression in Iran is systematic by the Government as a woman cannot travel, for example, and have\nno legal rights.  (TRR 96-98)  Applicant\u2019s family have played important in Iran\u2019s history.  She is\nproud of her Iranian cultural heritage.  Yet family ties were to Reza Shah who was deposed in 1979;\nthose ties created varying political problems for the family.  Her family, including her father, have\nno ties or links to the current government of Iran.  (Exhibits B, E, W; TRR 56-60; 85-86) Since she\nhas no present intention to return to Iran to visit, there is little likelihood of such pressure being\nbrought on her.  Applicant credibly established that even if someone were pressuring her family, she\nwould not yield to that kind of pressure.  \nReferences\nApplicant\u2019s project manager who has a Top Secret/ SCI security clearance, recommended\nthat Applicant be granted a Secret clearance.  She evaluated Applicant\u2019s work as \u201cexceptional.\u201d\nWith daily contact, this manager sees that Applicant works cooperatively and effectively with others\non the team.  Applicant has had no security, work, or ethics issues.  She has taken Security\nAwareness Training. The manager has trust in Applicant\u2019s ability to uphold the integrity of the U.S.\ngovernment and demonstrate full allegiance to the U.S. government.  She reported that Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate supervisor also assessed her positively.  She is an asset to the firm.  (Exhibit G)\nThe human resources manager and facility security officer reviewed Applicant\u2019s files and\nfound only positive information.  She has had no security violations and has taken three security\ncourses.  As a vital and valued member of the team, she has received bonus \u201cspot\u201d awards each year.\n(Exhibit H)\nA work colleague commented favorably on her work ethic and attention to detail.  He\nrecommended her for a security clearance based on her demonstrated loyal service to the project and\nmission.  (Exhibit I)\nA friend who has known her personally and professionally since 1999 and has a Top Secret\nclearance recommends her for a security clearance.  (Exhibit J)\nWork colleagues from her previous employer who worked with her from 2003 to 2004\nsupported her application for a security clearance.  (Exhibits L, M, N)\nApplicant received a 2006 certificate of appreciation.  (Exhibit K) She has been brief on\nsecurity fundamentals.  (Exhibit O) She has completed training seminars.  (Exhibits P, Q)\nA friend she has known since 1975 recommended her for a security clearance.  (Exhibit R)\nHer neighbors recommend her as responsible and professional. (Exhibit S) A former work colleague\nalso endorses her.  (Exhibit T)  Several friends have endorsed her.  (Exhibits U, V)  Her college\nprofessor who has known her since 1980 has endorsed her.  (Exhibit X)\nHer second cousin, who was born in Iran, but is now a citizen of Belgium who resides in the\nU.S. and works for the World Bank, testified for Applicant and provided additional details on the\n\n7\nfamily background.  (TRR 31-48)\nIran\nThe U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism 2005 concluded Iran continued\nto maintain ties to terrorist groups and provided \u201cunique safe haven, substantial resources and\nguidance to terrorist organizations.\u201d (AN I, page 171)  The U.S. State Department Background Note\non Iran noted that Iran\u2019s \u201cIslamic foreign policy\u201d emphasizes vehement anti-U.S. stances and\nconcluded that the U.S. believes that \u201cnormal relations are impossible until Iran\u2019s policies change.\u201d\n(AN  II, pages 5, 6)   The U.S. State Department Country Reports on human rights 2005 concluded\nIran has human rights issues.  (AN III) The Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a report\non Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses.  (AN IV)  The U.S. State Department has issued a\ntravel warning on Iran  (AN V) and a Consular Information Sheet (AN VI). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or\nabsence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant adjudication guidelines as set forth\nbelow:\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nE2.A2.1.1.  The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she\nmay be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the\nUnited States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the\npotential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in\nother countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an\nindividual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nE2.A3.1.1.  The concern: When an  individual acts in such a way as to indicate\na preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nE2.A5.1.1.  The Concern:  Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\n\n       The SOR raises no security concern over Applicant\u2019s grandmother.  Her mother who was a citizen of\n7\nthe U.S. is now a naturalized U.S. citizen and lives in the U.S.  Her engagement was annulled in 1993 and\nshe has no contact with this individual.\n      E2.A2.1.3  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  E2.A2.1.3.1.  A determination that\n8\nthe immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or\nassociate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power\nin a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United\nStates;    E2.A2.1.3.3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.\n8\ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision\nto grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching a fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence\nBecause of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran where her father and grandmother  live and remain\n7\ncitizens, the government raised foreign influence concerns under disqualifying conditions (DC):\nE2.A2.1.2. 1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of\naffection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country; and E2.A2.1.2.6.\nConduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a\nforeign government. The Government established through the documents they submitted for\nadministrative notice (AN I-VI) the turbulent relationship between the U.S. and Iran.\nWhile I have seriously considered these security concerns and the documents submitted for\nadministrative notice on Iran, I conclude Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to meet the\nheavy burden these circumstances present. And to mitigate  the Government\u2019s security concerns over\n8\npossible foreign influence. In evaluating the relevance of her conduct, I considered the following\nAdjudication Process factors: \n\n9\n\u2022\nE.2.21.1.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n\u2022\nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; \n\u2022\nE2.2.1.3.  The frequency and recency of the conduct; \n\u2022E2.2.1.4.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n\u2022E2.2.1.5.  The voluntariness of the participation; \n\u2022E2.2.1.6.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n\u2022E.2.2.1.7.  The motivation for the conduct; \n\u2022E.2.2.1.8.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n\u2022E.2.2.1.9.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (E.2.2. Adjudication Process)\nGiven her strong ties to the U.S. with her mother in the U.S. and her assets in the U.S.,\nApplicant established that there is little likelihood that she would submit to any potential pressure\non her family who remain in Iran.  One indication is that even when finances became an issue when\nshe was in college, she resisted pressures and did not give up her U.S. citizenship in order to get\nfunding for her college  That action indicates her independent character.  Also, she showed fortitude\nin ending a difficult relationship with an Iranian citizen and having it annulled in 1993 under Iranian\nlaw.  She subsequently returned to the U.S.\nSignificantly, her many references vouch for her allegiance to the U.S. and her\ntrustworthiness.  As Applicant\u2019s supervisor and the FSO established, Applicant has a substantial\nhistory with her employer since 2004 and is viewed as trustworthy.  Her work is always excellent.\nFormer colleagues, a college professor as well as  friends who have known her for a substantial\nperiod of time recommend her for access to classified information. Thus, I conclude there is limited\npotential for coercion, exploitation or duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.)   She feels no allegiance to the Islamic Republic of Iran.  She acknowledged\nthe repression in Iran is systematic by the Government as a woman cannot travel, for example, and\nhave no legal rights. Yet she resisted that pressure at age18 and refused to abandon her U.S.\ncitizenship as the price of receiving student aid from Iran.\nWhile she has family members who remain citizens and residents of Iran, her father is retired\nand has no ties to the government.  Applicant has been a U.S. citizen since birth, attended high\nschool and college here, and has not visited Iran since 2000 when she went to see her father for three\nweeks.  As will be discussed further below, she now has relinquished her Iranian passport to the\nPakistan Embassy and has no intent to exercise any rights of her Iranian citizenship since she\nsurrendered her passport.  Further, she has no present intention to return to Iran to visit.  Applicant\nconsiders herself an American and feels no ties to the Islamic Republic of Iran. If she were ever\napproached by an Iranian agent, she would inform U.S. authorities.  \nApplicant credibly established she would put the interests in the U.S. ahead of any loyalty\nto her birth family. Looking at all of these factors, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign\ninfluence  security concerns as it is unlikely that she could be exploited by coercive or non-coercive\nmeans by the government of Iran in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to\nher two family members there and her loyalty to the United States.  Should any such attempt be made\nApplicant testified credibly she would contact the appropriate officials.   \nThus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign duress or influence on Applicant\n\n       E2.A3.1.3.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A3.1.3.1.Dual citizenship\n9\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country; E2.A3.1.3.2. Indicators of possible\nforeign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship;\nE2.A3.1.3.3.Activity is sanctioned by the United States;  E2.A3.1.4.4. Individual has expressed a willingness\nto renounce dual citizenship.\n10\nand/or her immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  Contacts with\ncitizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual\npotentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign\nrelatives.  In reaching my conclusion, I have considered the totality of those ties and contacts, not\njust each one in isolation as the Appeal Board has mandated in the Appeal Board Decision and\nReversal Order in ISCR Case No. 02-22461 (October 27, 2005) at 6.  \nLooking at all of these factors, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign influence  security\nconcerns.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I\nconclude Applicant\u2019s family ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue\npressure on Applicant.  In this way, foreign influence security concerns are mitigated under a whole\nperson analysis.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. in Applicant's\nfavor.\nForeign Preference\nThe Government conceded Applicant had mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns over\nher possible preference for a foreign country over the United States.   While Applicant continued to\npossess her foreign passport after she was a U.S. citizen, she subsequently relinquished it as soon as\nshe learned of such security concerns.  Applicant has mitigated  these security concerns. As the\n9\nAppeal Board established in ISCR Case No. 03-11765 (April 11, 2005) at 14, \u201cGiven the wording\nof Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 4, the absence of evidence that Applicant\u2019s application\nfor renunciation of . . . citizenship has been approved did not preclude the Administrative Judge from\napplying that mitigating condition.\u201d  Thus, her actions in demonstrating her willingness to renounce\nher Iranian citizenship by filing the appropriate paperwork establishes she does not prefer the interests\nof another country over those of the U.S. \nHaving weighed the record evidence as a whole under the other factors outlined in Directive,\nI conclude Applicant's initially disqualifying conduct was not undertaken in such a way as to establish\nher preference for a foreign country over the U.S.  Additionally, considering the totality of the\nevidence, I conclude that there is little, if any, probability Applicant will someday reacquire her\nIranian passport and use it instead of her U.S. passport.   Applicant has demonstrated  a strong\npreference for the U.S. over any other foreign nation.\nTherefore, I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.  Thus, favorable findings are warranted with\nrespect to subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government conceded Applicant had mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns over\nApplicant\u2019s Personal Conduct when she failed to list on her SF 86 a prior spouse. Applicant\u2019s\n\n       E2.A5.1.2.2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\n10\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\n       E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:   E2.A5.1.3.1.  The\n11\ninformation was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or\nreliability; E2.A5.1.3.2.  The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has\nsubsequently provided correct information voluntarily;  E2.A5.1.3.3.  The individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts; E2.A5.1.3.4.  Omission of\nmaterial facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized\npersonnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided; E2.A5.1.3.5.  The\nindividual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation,\nor duress; E2.A5.1.3.6.  A refusal to cooperate was based on advice from legal counsel or other officials that\nthe individual was not required to comply with security processing requirements and, upon being made aware\nof the requirement, fully and truthfully provided the requested information; E2.A5.1.3.7.  Association with\npersons involved in criminal activities has ceased.\n11\nexplanations for her omissions are credible and establish that she had no intent to falsify the form.\nFurther, Applicant contested the conclusion that she was ever married to this individual.  Even if one\nwere to view these omissions as falling within, Disqualifying Condition 2 , I conclude that Applicant\n10\nmet the mitigation  guidelines as Applicant had earlier provided information on this relationship in\n11\na prior security form for a previous job. Also, looking at Applicant as a whole person and considering\nthe circumstances surrounding her conduct (E2.2.1.2), I conclude Applicant provided a rational basis\nfor her conduct and has refuted Personal Conduct security concerns.  Thus, after considering the\nAdjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR\nParagraph 3 under subparagraph 3.a.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

On August 30, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\nThe Judge left the record open for two weeks for the submission of additional evidence.\n1\n2\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in weighing the\nevidence and that the Judge should have mitigated the negative financial information in the case.\nIn support of his contention, Applicant submits financial documents, some of which were submitted\nat the hearing or immediately thereafter  and some of which constitute new evidence.  Applicant also\n1\ncites several Hearing Office decisions, which Applicant considers comparable to his situation, in\nwhich a favorable decision was rendered.\nThe Board may not consider new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Therefore, the Board\nmay not consider evidence Applicant now submits regarding steps Applicant took subsequent to the\nhearing to improve his financial position.  With regard to the evidence Applicant submitted during\nthe hearing or during the two weeks immediately thereafter, there is a rebuttable presumption that\nthe Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-07245 at 4 (App. Bd. May 20, 2005).\nApplicant\u2019s citation to other decisions by Hearing Office Judges, for the proposition that\nother applicants in situations similar to Applicant\u2019s have received favorable security clearance\ndecisions, does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge in this case.  A decision by another\nHearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues in other cases, even\nif an applicant establishes close factual similarities between the cited case and the instant case.  The\ncited decisions are not binding precedent on the Board in any event.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n30535 at 5 (App. Bd. May 4, 2005).\nMoreover, the application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of\nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement\nwith the weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a\nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-02471 at 2\n(App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  She articulated a rational basis for not applying any mitigating\nconditions and reasonably explained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate that the\n\n3\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-04874 at\n2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nclearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

RIVERA \n \n \n \nAPPEARANCES \n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nJon L. Roberts, Esq. \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior network administrator. In 1994, he stole and sold \ncomputer parts from his employer. Notwithstanding the passage of time and his otherwise good \nbehavior and employee record, his current lack of credibility creates doubts about his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. His favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the overall \npersonal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn October 25, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1).1 On \nJuly 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that DOHA \nadjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an \nadministrative judge for a security determination.2 On July 23, 2007, Applicant answered the \nSOR and requested a hearing.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 4, 2007. On September 7, 2007, I scheduled \nthe hearing for September 28, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The government \npresented four exhibits, marked GE 1-4, to support the SOR. GEs 1 and 2 were admitted without \nobjection. GEs 3 and 4 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, and presented three witnesses and seven exhibits, marked AE 1-7. AE 1-6 were admitted \nwithout objection. AE 7 was admitted over the Government\u2019s objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 9, 2007. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a. \nHis admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence \nof record, particularly his demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.  \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior network administrator.3 He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in \nMay 1980, achieved the rank of petty officer first class (pay grade E-6), and was honorably \ndischarged in May 1986. After his discharge, Applicant continued working for the Department of \nDefense (DOD) as a civilian employee until March 1990. He had access to classified information \nat the secret level while serving in the Navy and as a DOD civilian employee. There is no \nevidence of misconduct, questionable behavior, or that Applicant failed to comply with rules and \nregulations concerning the protection of classified information while employed by the DOD. \n \n                                                          \n1  Office of Personnel Management, Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86. \n \n2  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as \namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992) (Directive), as amended and revised. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense \n(Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) to all \nadjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued \non or after September 1, 2006.  \n \n3  GE 1, unless otherwise indicated, is the source for the facts in this paragraph. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n3\nApplicant married his wife in October 1987, and apparently they have no children. He \nattended college from September 1996 to June 1995; however, it is not clear whether he \ncompleted a degree. \n \nIn March 1990, Applicant was hired by a computer/information technology company as a \nsustaining engineer. He worked at the company\u2019s \u201cfinal test department\u201d where he and others he \nsupervised tested single in-line memory module (SIMM) chips (computer memory chips) for \nquality control. He kept and accumulated in his desk drawer SIMM chips that failed the quality \ncontrol tests. The company had no recycle system, and the faulty chips were thrown in the \ngarbage. Although the SIMM chips did not meet the quality required for the company\u2019s \nequipment and applications, the chips worked for DOS system computers. \n \nIn 1993, Applicant advertised for sale on the Internet some of the SIMM chips he had \naccumulated. He sold to an Internet buyer around 20 SIMM chips for approximately $500-\n$1,000. Applicant had sold other personally-owned computer parts to this same buyer in the past. \nIn October-November 1994, Applicant sold to the same buyer approximately 60 SIMM chips for \n$5,000. He mailed the chips to the buyer through UPS. The mailing required delivery \nconfirmation and $5,000 cash on delivery. Applicant insured the package for $5,000. After two \nweeks, Applicant received a $5,000 check from the buyer. He claimed the check at the UPS \noffice and was required the signature of the UPS office manager to cash the check at a bank. \nAfter cashing the check, Applicant spent around $1,300 and kept the remainder of the money in \nhis car. He testified that once he cashed the check, he \u201crealized that it was not a good thing, and \n[he] I was embarrassed or scared\u201d about going home to his wife with $5,000 cash (Tr. 217). \n \nApproximately one month after receipt of the check, Applicant was confronted by an \nagent of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), a local law enforcement officer, and one of \nhis company supervisors about the sale of the SIMM chips. The FBI had been called to assist the \ncompany to investigate industrial espionage concerning other proprietary custom hardware sold \nby Applicant\u2019s employer. Applicant was aware of the industrial espionage threat against his \ncompany because the concern was discussed in company meetings.  \n \nDuring the law enforcement interview, Applicant provided a statement in which he \nadmitted knowing that the SIMM chips he sold were the property of his company, and that he \nhad no authority to sell them (GE 2). Applicant sold the SIMM chips because he believed the \ncompany owed him money. His job status had been changed to a supervisor position and he was \nearning $10,000 less a year because he was no longer entitled to overtime pay. After he was \nquestioned by the FBI, Applicant reimbursed the $5,000 he received from the sale of the SIMM \nchips to his company. He was not arrested or charged as a result of his sale of the SIMM chips. \nAfter the investigation, he was fired from his job and required to cooperate with law \nenforcement. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant disputed parts of the December 1994 statement he provided to \nthe FBI agent. He claimed he sold SIMM chips only one time in the October-November 1994 \nperiod. He claimed at the time of the sale he believed the company had no interest in the SIMM \nchips because they were being thrown away into the garbage (Tr. 160-161); that he did not know \nthe value of the SIMM chips; that he only asked the buyer to pay him what he thought was fair \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\n(Tr. 151); that he did not negotiate the price of the chips and was surprised he received $5,000 in \npayment; that he was not upset with the company changing his job status (Tr. 158); and that he \ndid not lose earnings as a result of his change in status in the company.  \n \nAfter he was fired from his job in 1994, Applicant worked for two different companies as \nan administrator of information technology projects, and then as a senior administrator. In 2000, \nApplicant began working for another company as a senior consultant. During the summer of \n2003, he took scheduled leave with his family. When Applicant returned to work from his \nscheduled leave, he was fired from his job. He was fired because it had been too difficult for \nclients and company personnel to reach him over the telephone/e-mail while he was on vacation. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows that before he was fired from his job, he was considered a valued \nemployee and respected for his knowledge and work ethic by his co-workers and supervisors. At \nthe time, the company was downsizing due to economic problems and had let go most of its \nemployees. Applicant believed the real reason he was fired was because the company was \nreducing its employees. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that the circumstances under \nwhich Applicant was fired from his job in 2003 fail to raise security clearance concerns. \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant was hired by his current employer, a DOD contractor. He is \nthe senior network administrator and the information security systems manager for his company. \nHe has had access to classified information at the secret level since January 2004 (Tr. 133). \nApplicant has not been involved in any misconduct or questionable behaviour since the sale of \nthe SIMM chips in 1994. There is no evidence, and the Government did not allege that Applicant \nwas involved in any misconduct or questionable behavior prior to or after the 1993-1994 sale of \nSIMM chips. Moreover, there is also no evidence to suggest Applicant did not follow rules and \nregulations pertaining to the handling of classified information when he had access to classified \ninformation while working for DOD, or since 2004 while working for his current employer.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses consider him to be a top level performer, dependable, \nprofessional, diligent, conscientious, detail oriented, and very security conscious. In their \nopinion, Applicant displays good judgment and is extremely careful with classified information. \nHe has proven himself to be a reliable employee with exemplary work habits. \n \n \nPOLICIES \n \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be \nconsidered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost \nare the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to \nthe facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible \nironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair \nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, \nand the whole person concept.4 Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude \n                                                          \n4  AG \u00b6 2(a) provides, \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables \nknown as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n5\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the applicable, relevant \nadjudicative guidelines. \n \n \nBURDEN OF PROOF \n \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.5 The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial \nevidence.6 The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the \nultimate burden of persuasion.7  \n \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling \ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.8 \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance \nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15. \n \n \n \nIn 1993-1994, Applicant, without authority, took approximately 80 SIMM chips from his \nemployer and sold them for personal profit. His actions show poor judgment, unreliability, and \ndishonesty. In 1994, he provided a statement to law enforcement officers describing the \ncircumstances of his actions. In his May 2007 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 3), \nApplicant recanted his 1994 statement to the FBI agent. His testimony at the hearing was \nconsistent with his answers to the DOHA interrogatories. I find Applicant\u2019s recantation and \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n5  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n6  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial evidence is \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the \ncontrary evidence in the record); ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is \nmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence). \n \n7  Egan, supra n. 5, at 528, 531. \n \n8  See id; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\ntestimony not credible in light of his 1994 statement, and the SIMM chips\u2019 mailing receipt. He \nwas not forthcoming with his answers, and was evasive when explaining his 1993-1994 \nmisconduct.  \n \n \n \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to \nconsideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior, and (DC) \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, \nor concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . , apply. \n \nIt has been 13 years since Applicant\u2019s misconduct, and there is no evidence that he \nengaged in any misconduct or questionable behavior prior to, or after the 1993-1994 incidents. \nBased on the available evidence, except for the larceny of the SIMM chips, Applicant has been \nan upstanding husband, employee, and citizen. Moreover, there is also no evidence to suggest \nApplicant does not follow rules and regulations pertaining to the handling of classified \ninformation. Under normal circumstances, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 17(c): \nthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, would apply and would have \nmitigated the Guideline E concern. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, however, Applicant\u2019s failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers at his hearing (and in his answers to the DOHA \ninterrogatories) create doubts as to his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. I find that \nApplicant\u2019s recent lack of honesty and credibility undercut his claims of successful \nrehabilitation. Moreover, it shows Applicant is still potentially susceptible to pressure or \ncoercion resulting from his 1993-1994 behavior. Some of his character references were not \naware of his past questionable behavior. He could be susceptible to manipulation or coercion in \norder to cover his past questionable judgment and his embarrassing behavior.  \n \nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), criminal activity creates doubt about a person=s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 30. In 1993-1994, \nApplicant, without authority, took from his employer SIMM chips and sold them for personal \nprofit. He knew or should have known that his actions were illegal, and the taking was with the \nintent to permanently deprive his employer of the use of the chips. Disqualifying Condition (DC) \n\u00b6 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and DC \u00b6 31(c): allegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted, apply. \n \nIt has been 13 years since Applicant\u2019s misconduct, and there is no evidence that he \nengaged in similar questionable behavior prior to, or after 1994. Criminal Conduct Mitigating \nConditions AG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n7\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; applies. I considered AG \u00b6 \n32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement, and determined it \ndoes not apply. As discussed under Guideline E, Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility and \ntrustworthiness undercut his evidence of successful rehabilitation. On balance, however, I find \nApplicant has mitigated the Guideline J concerns. \n \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the whole person \nconcept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age (both at the time he committed the offense and \ncurrently), education, maturity, his years working for DOD and a defense contractor, his job \nperformance, qualifications, and his demeanor and testimony. Considering the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances, his favorable information fails to convince me that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant him access to classified information. He has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his overall behavior.  \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nDECISION \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 28, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On March 19, 2007, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nWe construe Applicant\u2019s appeal as alleging that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Applicant\u2019s brief and attachments include\nnew matters not submitted in his response to the File of Relevant Material.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had been discharged in bankruptcy in\n2001 but afterward ran up further significant debt.  While some of these debts had been paid off at\nthe time of the Judge\u2019s decision, the Judge concluded that, on the whole, Applicant\u2019s financial\nhistory evidenced \u201ccarelessness, irresponsibility, and poor judgement.\u201d  The Judge further concluded\nthat Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion that he should have a security clearance.  We\nhave examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of Applicant\u2019s brief on appeal and the record as a whole\nand conclude that it is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  We cannot consider the new\nmatters which Applicant has submitted in support of his appeal.  See Directive \u00b6  E3.1.29; ISCR\nCase No. 04-11369 at 1-2 (App. Bd.

Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\nApplicant answered the SOR on January 29, 2007, admitting the allegations, and requesting a\nhearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 12, 2007. I convened a hearing on April 17, 2007.\nDuring the hearing, I received nine government exhibits, 10 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open through May 4, 2007 to allow him to submit\nadditional exhibits. That day, he submitted one additional exhibit, which I marked and received as\nExhibit K. DOHA received the transcript on May 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old man with a 13-year-old child. He is a mail room supervisor who\noversees four employees and manages two mail rooms. He is well respected at work. According to\nhis boss, he \u201cexhibited integrity and honesty in the performance of his duty.\u201d  He has performed mail\n1\nroom work for 16 years.\nIn 1993, Applicant failed to pay his state income taxes. In 2000, the state government\nobtained a lien against his property in the amount of $4,026. In approximately December 2005, the\ngovernment propounded interrogatories to Applicant requesting, among other things, that he provide\nverification of any payments made toward the satisfaction of the lien. As of February 2006, when\nhe responded to the interrogatories, he had made no payments.  He initiated payments in December\n2\n\nExhibit B, Payment Receipts dated December 15, 2006, March 12, 20076, April 7, 2007; Exhibit K, Payment\n3\nReceipt dated May 4, 2007.\nAnswer, dated January 29, 2007, at 1.\n4\nTr. 24.\n5\nExhibit C, Payment Receipts, dated May 6, 2005, December 15, 2006, and March 12, 2007.\n6\nSee Tax Returns as Listed in Exhibit 3, Response to Interrogatories, at 13 through 24.\n7\nTr. 30; Exhibit A, Receipt of Payments.\n8\nTr. 35.\n9\nTr. 26.\n10\nAnswer at 9.\n11\nExhibit D, Letter from Creditor to Applicant, dated August 24, 2006.\n12\n3\n2006. Since then, he has made four payments of $125 each.  There is no record evidence that sets\n3\nforth the amount of the remaining balance.\nApplicant lived in one jurisdiction from 1999 to 2002 (State 1). He moved to an adjacent\nstate in late 2002, where he lived through 2004 (State 2). He did not file his state income tax returns\nfor either state.  In 2005, he filed the back income tax returns. He owed no income taxes to State 1,\n4\nbut owed approximately $1,400 in delinquent income taxes to State 2 for tax year 2004.  Since May\n5\n2005, he has made three payments totaling $385 toward this delinquency.6\nApplicant did not file his federal income tax returns from 1999 to 2005. In February 2006,\nhe filed returns for tax years 1999 through 2001, and 2003 through 2005.  It is unclear from the\n7\nrecord whether he ever filed for tax year 2002. He owes approximately $14,000 in back federal\nincome taxes, and has made ten payments since June 2006 ranging from $200 to $800.  \n8\nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his income tax returns roughly coincided with his separation from\nhis girlfriend. After she obtained custody of their son, Applicant was afraid that he could no longer\nreport him as a dependent for the purposes of a deduction, which could conceivably have resulted\nin him owing money.  \n9\nIn 2002, Applicant and his ex-girlfriend sought to formalize their agreement for him to pay\nchild support. He was given the option of making bimonthly payments through the court, or having\nhis wages garnished bimonthly. He chose the latter option.  He has never been delinquent. As of\n10\nMay 2006, he had overpaid in the amount of $63.00.11\nAs of March 2006, Applicant owed a creditor $391 for a delinquent phone bill. He satisfied\nit in August 2006.12\n\nTr. 42.\n13\nAnswer at 1.\n14\nTr. 42.\n15\nTr. 38.\n16\n4\nCurrently, Applicant has approximately $150 remaining each month after expenses.  He has\n13\ninvested $6,000 in a 401k.\nApplicant used marijuana approximately eight times in 1998. That summer, he was arrested\nand charged with possession of marijuana.  Following his completion of community service and\n14\nsome Alcoholics Anonymous sessions, the charges were dropped. He has not smoked marijuana\nsince 1998.15\nIn August 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86). He did not\ndisclose  the 2000 tax lien as required by Question 36 (Your Financial Record - Tax Lien - In the past\n7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?).\nAt the hearing, he testified that he was unaware of the lien when he completed the SF-86.16\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthey are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises\nquestions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n17\n5\ninformation. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n17\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant's child support payment history does not represent a security concern. However,\nhis failure to pay his 1993 state income tax, and failure to file his state and federal taxes for six\nconsecutive years between 1999 and 2005, in conjunction with his accrual of a delinquent phone bill\ntriggers the application of Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1\n(A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.2 (Deceptive or illegal\nfinancial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense\naccount fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional breaches of trust).\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\ndeserves credit for satisfying his phone bill, and filing his back returns. However, he filed his income\ntax returns less than two years ago after failing to file any for the previous six years, and his\npayments toward the satisfaction of the delinquencies have been sporadic. Moreover, he still owes\nin excess of $17,000 of back federal and local taxes, including his 1993 income tax delinquency. He\nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant\u2019s past marijuana involvement triggers the application of Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug abuse), and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (Illegal\n\nIn the last 7 years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production,\n18\ntransfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for your own\nintended profit or that of another?\n6\ndrug possession). He has not used any marijuana since his arrest nearly ten years ago. Drug\nInvolvement Mitigating Condition E2.A8.1.3.1 (The drug involvement was not recent), applies.\nApplicant has mitigated the drug involvement security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s omission of information regarding his drug use, in tandem with his omission of\nthe 2000 tax lien from his 2004 SF-86 raises the issue of whether Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)\napplies. Applicant neither purchased nor sold marijuana for his profit or as part of a wider criminal\nenterprise. PC DC 2 is inapplicable to Question 29.18\nWith respect to Question 36, PC DC 2 applies without mitigation. Given Applicant\u2019s history\nof failing to file his income taxes, his contention that he was unaware of an outstanding tax lien was\nnot credible.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s drug use no longer poses a security concern. He appears to be financially stable\nenough to implement and sustain a payment plan to resolve his income taxes. However, his\nrepayment of the tax delinquencies has been sporadic and disorganized. I also remain concerned with\nhis explanation for choosing not to file income tax returns on time, and his falsification of his SF-86.\nUpon considering these facts in conjunction with the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 3 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns\nunder Guideline F to Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 11, 2007.  She\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 6, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on the same day.  Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on November 29, 2007, and I received the case\nassignment on December 13, 2007, after it was transferred from another administrative\nApril 28, 2008\n\n2\njudge because of caseloads.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January 25, 2008.\nAn amended Notice of Hearing was issued January 31, 2008, changing the location of\nthe hearing.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 13, 2008.  The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on her own behalf and submitted no exhibits. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 27, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated November 16, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.b to 1.g of the SOR.  She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a and 2.a of the SOR.

(Tr. 18-33, 44-54;\nExhibits 1-4)\nIn 2005,Applicant  was admitted to the hospital for detoxification and for\ntreatment after a suicide attempt which occurred when she was intoxicated.  She\ningested Prozac and Prilosec to attempt suicide.  Applicant was in alcoholic\nrehabilitation for four weeks, from May 26 to June 13, 2005.  At the time she was\nadmitted to rehabilitation, she had been drinking a fifth of vodka a day, her alcohol of\nchoice after 2004. She was diagnosed as alcohol dependent during her 2005\nhospitalization. She attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for one year, from June 2005\nuntil August 2006, during which time she also was in a counseling program for alcohol\ndependence.  She had an aftercare treatment recommendation beyond August 2006,\nbut she did not participate in further treatment.  Applicant took three prescription\nmedications, including Anabuse, for one year after her 2005 hospitalization to help\ncontrol her alcohol addiction.  She stopped taking the medications on her own initiative.\nShe did not drink alcohol for about eight months after August 2006.  Since April 2007,\nwhen she resumed drinking alcohol, she has two drinks a week.  She admits she is an\nalcoholic.  Applicant admitted the craving for alcohol never goes away, that alcoholism\nis a disease, and that she could not explain why she started drinking again.  She also\ncould not explain how an alcoholic, such as herself, could start drinking again and not\n\n3\nlose control.  Applicant admitted her drinking was a problem in the past, but does not\nthink it is a problem for her now. (Tr. 18-35, 44-54; Exhibits 1-4)\nApplicant was arrested on March 6, 1992, on charges of operating a motor\nvehicle with a blood alcohol content of more than .1%, and operating the vehicle while\nintoxicated (OWI).  She was found guilty of the OWI, fined an unknown amount,\nordered to enroll in a six-month alcohol counseling program, and had her driver\u2019s\nlicense suspended for six months.  The first count was dismissed. (Tr. 21; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant was arrested again on September 30, 1997, and charged with the\nsame offenses as were made against her in 1992.  Again, she was found guilty of OWI,\nfined $611, ordered to have an alcohol assessment completed, and ordered to undergo\nany recommended treatment for six months, and had her driver\u2019s license again\nsuspended for six months.  The first count was again dismissed. (Tr. 22; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant was arrested on October 30, 2003, and charged with operating a motor\nvehicle with a blood alcohol content of more than .1% (third offense), and OWI (third\noffense).  Again, she was found guilty of the OWI charge, sentenced to 90 days in jail,\nwhich sentence was suspended, fined $2,090, and ordered to report to a treatment\nfacility for an alcohol assessment and any recommended treatment.  Applicant\u2019s\ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for 29 months and she was placed on probation.  Again,\nthe blood alcohol count was dismissed. (Tr. 23; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant completed her SF 85P on September 20, 2004.  In her answer to\nQuestion 20 about any arrests or convictions in the past seven years, Applicant stated,\n\u201cYes,\u201d and disclosed the October 2003 alcohol related incident.  She did not disclose\nthe September 30, 1997, alcohol and driving arrest.  That incident was 10 days within\nthe seven year period.  Applicant claims she miscalculated the time back seven years\nand did not intentionally falsify her SF 85P. (Tr. 34-36; Exhibit 1)\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\n\n4\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Alcohol Consumption\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is\nset out in AG & 21:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns\nin this case.  Under AG & 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, . . ., or other incidents of concern, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d is a\ntrustworthiness disqualifying condition. \u201d Applicant has three OWI arrests and\nconvictions in an 11-year period.  \u00b6 22(c) pertains to \u201chabitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  Applicant went into\ndetoxification in 2005 after attempting suicide while consumption alcohol.  She was\ndrinking a fifth of vodka a day at that time.  Under \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse\nor alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized alcohol treatment program\u201d is applicable because of the 2005 diagnosis.  \u00b6\n22(f) addresses, \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. She was in alcohol rehabilitation in\n2005 and 2006, diagnosed with alcohol dependence, taking Anabuse to control her\ncraving to drink, attending AA, and then started drinking again after completing all those\nefforts to cease drinking.  She drinks alcohol currently. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from alcohol consumption. None of them apply to\nApplicant. AG \u00b6 23(b) to (d) do not apply because they encompass abstinence or\nresponsible use, participation in a current counseling or treatment program, with no\nrelapses, satisfactory progress, or completion of counseling or rehabilitation programs\non an outpatient or inpatient basis, a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence,\nparticipation in AA, and a favorable prognosis from a professional member of a\nrecognized treatment program.  \u00b6 23(a) requires the passage of so much time, or\ninfrequent behavior, or unusual circumstances under which the behavior occurred that it\nwould be unlikely to recur.  Applicant does not meet this mitigating condition either. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe trustworthiness concern pertaining to Personal Conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6\n15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant disclosed on her trustworthiness application that she had been\narrested, and one of her arrests that occurred in 2003.  It is reasonable to believe that\nshe miscalculated the time period by 10 days and missed including her 1997 OWI\narrest.  She put the Government on notice she had a criminal record, and denies she\nhad any intention to falsify this form.  I believe her statement.  Therefore, there are no\n\n6\ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 that apply.  Consequently, no mitigating\nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 need be applied.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has a life-time struggle\nwith excessive alcohol consumption, being diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and\nadmitting to alcoholism, yet continuing to consume alcohol with no support mechanism\nfor abstinence. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  She knew she was drinking alcohol and becoming\nintoxicated, and that she had three OWI arrests in an 11-year period. (See AG &\n2(a)(2).)  Her consumption of alcohol is recent and weekly. (See AG & 2(a)(3).)  She\nwas a minor when she first sampled alcohol at 13, but an adult during her most serious\ndrinking periods.  Her alcohol consumption is voluntary, as was her decision to stop\ntaking Anabuse and other medications to help control her alcohol dependence. (See\nAG & 2(a)(4) and (5).)  Applicant was in rehabilitation in 2005 and 2006, and stopped\nattending any more counseling sessions.  There is no evidence of current rehabilitation\nand permanent behavioral changes.  (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  Applicant is motivated to\ndrink by her craving for alcohol.  (See AG & 2(a)(7).)  She has great potential for\ncoercion, pressure, exploitation, or duress because of her alcohol dependence. (See\nAG & 2(a)(8).) Finally, there is the greatest likelihood of continuation or recurrence of\nApplicant continuing to consume alcohol because of her dependence on that\nsubstance, and thus demonstrating a pattern of poor judgments.  (See AG & 2(a)(9).) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her\nalcohol consumption.  She did mitigate the trustworthiness concerns under the personal\nconduct guideline.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against her.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

Her debts were discharged in December 2005.\nPost-bankruptcy, four additional delinquent debts showed up on her credit report, an approximate\ntotal of $4,715. She and her husband owe the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $17,157\nfor delinquent income taxes for tax years 1996-2001 and 2003.  They recently entered into a\nrepayment plan with the IRS but provided no evidence pertaining to the additional delinquent\naccounts.  Applicant deliberately failed to list her delinquent debts on her questionnaire for public\ntrust position. She has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations and\npersonal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn September 22, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a a position of public trust.  The SOR, which is in\n1\nessence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated December 5, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on May 30, 2007. The FORM was\nmailed to Applicant on June 4, 2007, and received on June 18, 2007. Applicant was afforded an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on August 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to all of the allegations. Her admissions are\nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits,\nI make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis applying for a trustworthiness position. She is married and has two sons, ages 15 and 12.2\n\n Item 4.\n3\n Item 5.\n4\n Item 10.\n5\n Item 5. \n6\n Item 13.\n7\n Item 5 at 1-2. \n8\n3\nOn May 11, 2004, Applicant completed a questionnaire for public trust position, Standard\nForm 85P (SF 85P).   She answered \"No\" in response to question 22(a) Your Financial Record, \"In\n3\nthe last 7 years, have you, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy,\nbeen declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgment rendered against you for\na debt? If you answered, \"Yes,\" provide date of initial action and other information requested\nbelow.\" She did not disclose a federal tax lien filed against her in May 2002 for nonpayment of tax\ndebt for tax years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999.  Applicant claims that she was not aware of the tax\nlien at the time she filled out the SF 85P.  Her husband handled all of the financial affairs for the\nfamily.  \n4\nApplicant also answered, \"No\" in response to question 22(b) on her May 11, 2004, SF 85P\nwhich reads, \"Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include\nloans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\" A credit report, dated May\n25, 2004, was obtained during Applicant's background investigation. The credit report listed 26\ndelinquent accounts, an approximate total of $18,257. Most of the delinquent accounts were over\n180 days delinquent.  Applicant claims that she was not aware of the extent of her financial problems\n5\nwhen she filled out her questionnaire for a public trust position. However, she admits that she was\naware that there were some outstanding delinquent accounts, yet did not indicate any delinquencies\non her trustworthiness questionnaire.  \n6\nOn August 29, 2005, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  She listed assets of\n$2,150 and liabilities of $47,888. Her debts were discharged on December 22, 2005 and the\nbankruptcy case was closed on December 29, 2005.7\nPost-bankruptcy, Applicant admits to owing the IRS approximately $17,157 in federal\nincome taxes for tax years 1996-2001 and 2003. Her husband handled the family financial matters.\nShe later discovered they did not withhold enough money from their paychecks to cover the tax\nobligations.8\nTwo additional credit reports, dated July 19, 2006, and May 22, 2007, revealed the following\noutstanding accounts: a $1,463 student loan account, placed for collection in November 2003 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.d), a $2,960 judgment was entered against Applicant in January 2005 on behalf of a vocational\ntraining institute (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a $197 delinquent account, placed for collection in August 2000 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b); and a $95 retail store account related to insufficient funds checks, placed for collection in\nSeptember 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). The student loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was also alleged in SOR\n\n Item 9.\n9\n Item 5 at 2. \n10\n Id. at 9. \n11\n Item 8. \n12\n  See Items 12 and 13. \n13\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n14\n4\n\u00b6 1.e).  I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.e since it is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.d as indicated\nby the identical account numbers.\n  \nApplicant states her family's financial problems began in August 1999 after she, her husband\nand their two small children moved to the state where her parents resided due to her father's poor\nhealth.  She and her husband had difficulty finding employment.  They did not have jobs lined up\nprior to moving.   The family finances were further aggravated by additional expenses incurred\n9\nrelated to two hip replacement surgeries her husband had in September 2001 and July 2002.   The\n10\nfamily's income was also reduced from April to December 2002 because Applicant was on medical\nleave during much of this period.11\nIn February 2006, Applicant and her husband entered into a payment plan with the IRS,\nagreeing to pay $200 per pay period towards their IRS debt.  Applicant provided no evidence to\n12\nindicate that timely payments are being made towards this payment plan. She provided no evidence\nthat she took steps to resolve the debts listed under her most recent credit reports (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d,\n1.g and 1.h).  \n13\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n14\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense,\neffective September 1, 2006, sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in\nthis case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n15\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 15.\n16\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n17\n Id.\n18\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n21\n5\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.15\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.16\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n17\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n18\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n19\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.20\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  The same rules apply towards trustworthiness\n21\ndeterminations for access to sensitive positions.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nApplicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. She has encountered financial\nproblems since 1999. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, she had over 26 delinquent accounts, totaling\napproximately $18,257.  She and her husband also owed the IRS for overdue taxes for tax years 1996-\n2001 and 2003, an approximate total of $17,157. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n(FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's case.\nFC DC \u00b619(e) (consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial\nanalysis) applies due to Applicant's excessive indebtedness and her inability to meet her financial\nobligations to include her federal income taxes. \nThe financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\npotentially could be applied.  Applicant and her husband have suffered from medical problems which\nprevented them from working in the early 2000s. Applicant considered her options and decided to\nfile for bankruptcy which is a legal way of resolving one's debts. However, she has since incurred\nseveral delinquent accounts after the bankruptcy and provided no evidence that she has taken steps\nto resolve these accounts.\n \nFC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolved debts ), applies, in part, because the majority of Applicant's debts were discharged\nafter her bankruptcy.  Applicant recently entered into a repayment plan with the IRS to repay the tax\ndebt. I give this mitigating condition less weight due to the fact that Applicant has not provided\nevidence that she is making regular payments towards the tax debt, and provided no evidence to\nindicate that she is repaying her student loans and the other accounts that were not discharged in\nbankruptcy.\nApplicant provided no information as to her current financial status.  A question remains as\nto whether she will be capable of making regular payments towards the tax debt. There is no evidence\nthat she received financial counseling which would be helpful given her past history of financial\n\n Item 9 at 2. \n22\n Item 5. \n23\n7\nirresponsibility.  For these reasons, Applicant has not provided sufficient information to mitgate the\nconcerns under Guideline F.    \nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard\nclassified and/or sensitive information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a\nmaterial fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified her public trust position application, dated May 11, 2004,\nin response to questions 22(a) and 22(b).  She allegedly deliberately falsified her response to question\n22(a) because she failed to list a tax lien filed against her in May 2002. Applicant states that she was\nnot aware of the tax lien at the time of she filled out the security clearance application because her\nhusband handled the finances. With respect to omitting the tax lien, I find that Applicant did not\ndeliberately falsify her response to question 22(a). However, I find that she did deliberately falsify\nher response to question 22(b) which asked whether applicant was over 180 days delinquent on any\nloan or financial application.  Applicant may not have been aware of all of her delinquent accounts\nbut she does admit that she knew there were some outstanding debts at the time she completed her\nSF 85P.   She answered \"No\" to question 22(b) although she was aware that she had delinquent\n22\naccounts.  In an affidavit dated September 16, 2004, Applicant provided further details about her\ndelinquent debts,  supporting the premise that she was aware that she had some delinquent debt at the\ntime she filled out the SF 85P.23\nWith respect to Applicant's deliberate false answer to question 22(b) on her Questionnaire for\nPublic Trust Position, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, of falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) applies.  I find that none of the personal conduct mitigating\nconditions apply.  Applicant's decision to deliberately omit information about her delinquent debts\non her SF 85P raises questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  She has not\nmitigated the concerns raised by her conduct.  I find against Applicant under personal conduct\nconcern.  \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal\n\n8\nconduct. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of public trust. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Applicant's request\nto be granted a position of public trust is denied.\nErin C. Hogan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Guideline M allegations and SOR \u00b6 1.d\n1\nwere withdrawn.  Those favorable dispositions are not at issue on appeal.\nThe satellite television programs were accessed between 2002 and 2003, and were valued at approximately\n2\n$14,000.  The 200 computer programs were downloaded between 1999 and 2003, and were valued at approximately\n$10,000.\n2\nAdministrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.1\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline E had not been mitigated.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline E had not been mitigated.  With respect to the falsification of his security clearance\napplication, Applicant argues that the Judge should have found the disqualifying conduct mitigated,\nas a matter of law, under the relevant Mitigating Conditions, because the conduct was an isolated\nincident; not likely to recur; and he had subsequently provided the correct information voluntarily.\nWith respect to his multiple instances of accessing premium, pay-per-view, pornographic and other\nsatellite television programs (for himself and others) without paying the required fees, and his\ndownloading of multiple computer programs without paying the required costs,  Applicant argues\n2\nthe Judge should have found the disqualifying conduct mitigated, as a matter of law, under the whole\nperson factors, based upon the totality of the evidence.  The Board does not find these arguments\npersuasive.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant with\nrespect to some of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).\nGiven the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\n\n3\nGuideline E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

On\n1\nNovember 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security\n2\nconcerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were\nprovided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn December 26, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 12, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 14,\n2007, scheduling the hearing for April 5, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the\nhearing, the Government submitted 1 exhibit, Ex. 1, and Applicant submitted 11 exhibits (Exs. A-K).\nAll of the exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non April 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations under Guideline H, subparagraphs 1.a through\n1.d. He also admitted the factual allegations under Guideline E, subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 33 years old and has worked as a senior proposal specialist for a defense\ncontractor since November 2003.  He graduated from high school in June 1992. Applicant attended\n3\ndifferent colleges while trying to attain his undergraduate degree. He experimented with drugs and\nwas suffering from depression. His grades were poor, and he left a different college because he could\nnot cope and attendance at the college was not a good fit. In 1998, he left college and moved back\nhome with his parents. During the next two years, he wrote for a local newspaper.  After working\n4\nas a reporter, he returned to college and received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a well-known university\nin May 2002, at the age of 28.  He was married in July 2004, and he has a daughter.\n5\nFrom 1993 to 1998, Applicant used marijuana approximately 30 to 40 times. During that\nsame time frame, he used cocaine approximately 12 times. Between 1997 and 1998, he purchased\n\nTr. 32.\n6\nTr. 32.\n7\nTr. 33.\n8\nTr. 33.\n9\nAnswer to SOR, dated December 26, 2006.\n10\n4\ncocaine approximately three to four times. He started smoking marijuana soon after he joined a\nfraternity at college.  \n6\nFrom 1995 until 1998, Applicant used the prescription drug Percoset, on approximately 5 to\n10 occasions. The drug was not prescribed for his use by a medical professional. His friends supplied\nthe Percoset. The last time that he used drugs was in November or December 1998.\nIn response to Question 27 on the December 1, 2003 SF 86, asking (Your Use of Illegal\nDrugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs: since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever\nis shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack\ncocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription\ndrugs?), he answered \u201cyes.\u201d He listed his past use of marijuana and cocaine. He failed to disclose\nthat he used Percoset on approximately 5 to 10 occasions between 1995 and 1998. The omissions\nof this fact was not deliberate. He testified that he did not deliberately provide false information\nwhen responding to this question. He did not recall having used the painkillers when completing the\nSF 86, so he did not record that information.7\nIn has answer to the SOR, he stated the following about using drugs:\nWith regard to my prior drug use, I can only say that I regret my behavior during that\nperiod of my life, which ended more than 8 years ago. While I lacked the knowledge\nand perspective to make responsible decisions in my early 20s, I am much better\nequipped to make more appropriate decisions now. As a 32-year-old husband and\nfather, I am grateful for having gained the distance, knowledge, and maturity to\nhandle my life in a more responsible manner, both for myself and for the people in\nmy life who count on me.\nBetween 1998 and 1999, he saw two therapists for treatment of depression.  Although there\n8\nwas a correlation between drug use and his depressions, he was not ordered to seek drug treatment.9\nSince 2003, and continuing through June 2005, Applicant had an ongoing association with\npersons involved in criminal activity, namely the use of marijuana. He stated: \u201c[i]n the past 18\nmonths, I have seen these persons approximately six times, and on none of these occasions, to my\nknowledge, has any drug use occurred.\u201d10\n\nExs. A, C-K (character letters).\n11\nEx. C (Letter, dated April 3, 2007).\n12\nEx. D (Letter, undated).\n13\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n14\nId. at 527.\n15\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n16\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n17\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n19\n5\nApplicant offered 10 character letters from friends, coworkers, and long-time friends.  His\n11\nsupervisor wrote that Applicant started work at their firm in October 2003, and she has supervised\nhim since October 2005. She indicated: \u201c[Applicant] is a very exemplary employee in his\nprofessionalism, demeanor, and ethical conduct. He is a very mature, dedicated, and trustworthy\nemployee.\u201d  He has known another person as a friend and colleague for over 12 years.  This\n12\n13\nwitness stated: \u201cI have been privileged to watch him [Applicant] grow from a somewhat awkward\nand distracted student to a reliable and successful professional.\u201d The other letters are similarly with\nglowing attestations to Applicant\u2019s professionalism, integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n14\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n15\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n16\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n17\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n18\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n19\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\n\n6\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nDrug Involvement\nDrug involvement is a security concern because use of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nApplicant not only used marijuana and cocaine but he also purchased cocaine. He also used\na prescription drug, on occasion, when he was not authorized to take this prescription drug. Thus,\nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) and DI DC \u00b6 25(c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate drug involvement security concerns. While at college, Applicant\nwas a young, immature man who was using drugs as a coping mechanism. He went from college to\ncollege, not finding a good fit, and continued to use drugs. Although he began college in 1992, he\ndid not graduate until 2002. While attending college, he took two years off and worked as a reporter,\nbut the financial rewards were too meager and he returned to school. He finally saw that the life he\ncreated for himself was destructive. Applicant stopped using drugs in either November or December\n1998. In 1998 and 1999, he finally was treated for his depression and coincidentally had stopped\nusing drugs. Since 2003, and continuing through June 2005, Applicant had an ongoing association\nwith persons who continued to use marijuana. In the past one and one-half years, he has seen those\npeople on at least six occasions. As far as he knows, none of them used drugs in his presence.\nConsequently, Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and\nDI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  (b)(3) (an\nappropriate period of abstinence) apply. Applicant has abstained from drug use for more than nine\nyears and has ceased his friendship with drug users. Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s case.\nAllegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are found for Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Applicant did not deliberately falsify a material fact on his SF 86. I believe\nhe was truthful and credible when he stated that he forgot to list that he had used a prescription drug\n\n7\nfor recreational purposes. Thus Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) does not apply. Allegations 2.a and 2.b of the SOR are found\nfor Applicant\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas gone from a distracted, drug-using student, to being a mature professional. His peers find him to\nhave integrity. They also believe that he is  honest and trustworthy. He ceased using drugs a little less\nthan 10 years ago. He continues to grow professionally. He has been treated for his depression. He\nhas turned his life around and his negative, drug-using behavior is part of his past and not a part of\nhis future. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to\nclassified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H (Drug Involvement):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

TUIDER\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRichard Moorhouse, Esq.\nEmily Parker, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nForty-one-year-old Applicant is a Syrian-born, naturalized United States citizen.  Although\nhe has much more substantial connections to the United States than to Syria, he has immediate\nfamily members who are citizens of and live in Syria, and he has frequent contact with them.\nBecause of Syria\u2019s poor human rights record and hostility towards the United States government, he\nmust overcome a heavy burden to mitigate security concerns.  He failed to meet this heavy burden.\nSecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On April 21, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nof the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 26, 2006, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  DOHA received the case on January 10, 2007, and it was\nassigned to me the same day.  \nOn January 24, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on\nFebruary 14, 2007.  On February 10, 2007, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing changing\nthe hearing date to February 28, 2007.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  \nAt the hearing, the Government presented three exhibits, which were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3, without objection.  Applicant presented two exhibits, which were marked\nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B.  I held the record open to afford the Applicant time to submit\nadditional material.  Applicant did submit additional material which was forwarded by Department\nCounsel without objection and marked AE C. \nAs requested by Department Counsel, I took administrative notice or official notice of\nvarious facts derived from certain matters about Syria and the nature of its government as described\nin the government\u2019s Administrative Notice and accompanying documents marked as Ex. I.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802\nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice in ISCR\nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein,\nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for\nadministrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Exhibit I, and I took\nadministrative notice of them.  Tr. 11-13.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on\nMarch 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations except \u00b6 1.b.  His admissions are\nincorporated into my findings, and after a thorough review of the record, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nApplicant is a 41-year-old principal network engineer employed by a defense contractor.  He\nhas been with his current employer since April 2006 and is a first time applicant for a security\nclearance.  Tr. 84-86, GE 1.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2004 and holds\na U.S. passport issued in March 2004.  GE 1.  He is unmarried with no dependents.  He previously\nmarried in June 1988 and divorced in December 2000.  GE 1.\nApplicant was born and for the most part was raised in Syria.  His parents were employed\nas teachers by the Syrian Ministry of Education and spent their teaching careers in Syria, except for\ntwo postings to Yemen and Kuwait (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  Applicant\u2019s father is 76 years old and his mother\nis 70 years old, and they along with Applicant\u2019s younger brother are resident citizens of Syria (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a.).  Both his parents retired approximately ten years ago and receive a small pensions from the\nSyrian government.  Tr. 37, 58.  Applicant\u2019s older 44-year-older brother lives in the U.S. and is a\ncitizen of Syria (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  Tr. 58. Applicant\u2019s 40-year-old younger sister is a dual citizen of Syria\nand Germany.  She currently is a housewife and resides with her husband in Germany (SOR \u00b6 1.c.).\nIn 1983, Applicant\u2019s father was posted to the U.S. by the Syrian government for a four-year\ntour.  Applicant along with his mother and two younger siblings, accompanied him and took up\nresidence in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s older brother was already in the U.S. attending college. Tr. 54.\nWhen his father completed his posting, the family returned to Syria in 1987, except for Applicant\nand his older brother who remained behind in the U.S. to complete college.  \nIn September 1991, Applicant was awarded a bachelor of science degree in computer\nengineering.  Following his graduation from college, Applicant worked primarily in the information\ntechnology field for several different employers until he secured his present employment.  In addition\nto his college degree, Applicant has been certified by Novell, MCI Microsoft, CISCO, and CCIE.\nTr. 32.  \nSince Applicant\u2019s parents returned to Syria in 1987, he has visited his family approximately\nsix times, each visit averaging two weeks, with the most recent visit being in 2005.  Tr. 36-37, 40-41.\nApplicant\u2019s parents own the apartment they live in, which Applicant estimates is worth \u201cabout\n$50,000.00.\u201d  Tr. 37-38.  Neither Applicant nor his parents have ever been contacted by any official\nof the Syrian government.  Tr. 39.  Applicant testified that if any pressure were put on his family\nmembers in Syria by any arm of the Syrian government, he would report such contact to his security\nofficer.  Tr. 49.\nShortly after Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2004, he submitted immigrant visa petitions\nto bring his parents and younger brother to the U.S.  His petitions were complete as of December\n2006, and his parents and brother were waiting to be contacted by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus\nfor further processing.  Tr. 42-43, AE A.  At the time of his hearing, Applicant was of the belief it\nwould take an additional two to six months to process his parents\u2019 petitions and up to ten years to\nprocess his brother\u2019s petition.  Tr. 44, 47. In any event, all three petitions to come to the U.S. were\nand are in a pending status.  Applicant\u2019s understanding is when his parents\u2019 visa petition is finally\napproved, they will take up permanent residency in the U.S. and not return to Syria.  Tr. 46.  \nApplicant sends approximately $5,000.00 to $8,000.00 per year to his father in Syria (SOR\n\u00b6 1.e.).  He communicates with his parents by telephone \u201cA couple of times a month.  Maybe two\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nor three times a month.\u201d  Tr. 78.  He often times speaks with his brother when he calls his parents\nand also communicates with his brother by e-mail \u201cevery two months or three months or something.\u201d\nTr. 79-80.\nApplicant owns a condominium valued at approximately $340,000.00 and has a net worth\nof \u201cabout $150,000 to $200,000.\u201d  Tr. 87.  He conducts all his banking in the U.S., has a 401 K\naccount and a separate retirement account.  Tr. 88.  He is registered to vote in the U.S., has worked\non his local congressman\u2019s election campaign, and owns two automobiles.  Tr. 37, 88.  AE B.  \nApplicant\u2019s friend of 21 years, who is the president of a company specializing in computer\nanalysis and human safety analysis, described him as honest, straight forward, and dependable.  Tr.\n97.  The Director of Information Technology and Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor stated approximately\n90% of their company\u2019s work is through government contracts and about 25% of this work is\nclassified.  Their company holds a Facility Security Clearance at one of their offices and has\nestablished security compliance measures which are well-known among the company employees.\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor  interacts with him on a daily basis and describes him as reliable, loyal,\nefficient, with a strong work ethic and one of the company\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d employees.  AE C. \nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.\nInstead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making\noverall common sense determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the\nevidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant\nAdjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.\nThe government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts\nmust have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, the President has\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified\ninformation to \u201cUnited States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively\nindicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\ndiscretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for\ncoercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and\nprotection of classified information.\u201d  Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information \u00a7\n3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting\nthe security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is\nrequired is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts\nproven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness,\nthen the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial\nevidence in explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite\nthe existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance. \nSecurity clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto do so.\u201d  See Executive Orders 10865 \u00a7 2 and 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2 \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nDoubts are to be resolved against the applicant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2013Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, a \u201csecurity risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,\nor obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could\ncreate the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also\nrelevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1.\nOne of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a\nsecurity concern in this case.  FI DC 1 applies where an \u201cimmediate family member, or a person to\nwhom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present\nin, a foreign country.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1. \u201cImmediate family members\u201d include a spouse,\nfather, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. Applicant\u2019s father,\nmother, two brothers, and sister are either \u201cimmediate family members\u201d or persons to whom he \u201chas\nclose ties of affection or obligation\u201d or both.  They are also citizens of and live in or are connected\nto Syria.  Although his older brother lives in the United States, and his younger sister lives in\n\nSee e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (noting security concerns because applicant\u2019s\n2\nbrother and mother-in-law live in Iran); ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) (indicating low relevance\nif foreign relatives spend part of each year in the United States).\nThe discussion in this opinion of FI MC 1 relies heavily on and occasionally quotes without attribution the\n3\ndiscussion of this same issue in ISCR Case No. 03-10312 at 6-9 (A.J. May 31, 2006).  See also ISCR Case No. 03-10954\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (attorney/consultant to an entity controlled by a foreign ministry is an \u201cagent of a foreign\npower\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 6 (App. Bd.

Even if only one relative lives in Syria, this factor\n2\nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the\ncompromise of classified information.  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006).\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law,\ndisqualifying under Guideline B.  ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  However, such\nties do raise a security concern under FI DC 1 and Applicant is required  to present evidence of\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.  Id.\nSecurity concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing that any of the five\nforeign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC) apply.  FI MC 1 recognizes that security concerns\nare reduced when there is \u201c[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father\nmother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of\na foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has\ndecided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not agents\nof a foreign power, and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could\nforce Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the U.S.  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at\n5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004).\nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201cAn employee of a foreign government need not be\nemployed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military, or other national security\nduties to be an agent of a foreign power\u201d for purposes of FI MC 1.  ISCR Case No. 02-24254 (App.\nBd. Jun. 29, 2004).  In a series of decisions, the Appeal Board has broadly defined \u201cagent of a\nforeign power.\u201d   \n3\nThe second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the \u201cassociate(s)\nin question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States.\u201d The Appeal\nBoard interprets this language as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must\naffirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a\nforeign relative or acquaintance in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\n2006) (\u201c[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate\nthat his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to\nthem and his loyalty to the United States.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005).\nFI MC 1 does not, by its express terms, exclude from consideration applicants with relatives\nor associates in countries where terrorism has occurred, any more than it excludes person from\ncountries where there are foreign governments, foreign political organizations, or foreign non-\ngovernmental organizations.  Rather, it focuses on a very specific type of threat\u2013the risk of a foreign\npower exploiting an applicant\u2019s foreign relatives in such a way as to cause an applicant to act\nadversely to the interests of the United States. The Appeal Board has limited the applicability of FI\nMC 1 where there is a history of terrorist activity in the foreign country in question.  ISCR Case No.\n03-22643 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005).\nApplicant\u2019s parents receive pensions from the Syrian government and are dependent in part\non this income to meet their day-to-day expenses.  Such dependence on the Syrian government\nplaces his parents in a potentially vulnerable situation.  \nApplicant\u2019s older brother holds dual citizenship with the United States and Syria.  He lives\nin the United States and not in Syria as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human\nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are\nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or\ndependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against\nthe United States. The hostility of Syria to the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of\npersuasion\u201d on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate family members in Syria do not pose\na security risk, and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States\nand his family members. With its adversarial stance and its dismal human rights record, it is\nconceivable that Syria would target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the United\nStates.\nThere is no evidence that his elderly father and mother, his two brothers, and sister are or\nhave been political activists or journalists, challenging the policies of the Syrian government.\nLikewise, there is no evidence that these relatives work for the Syrian government or military or any\nnews media.  There is no evidence that the Syrian government has approached any of his Syrian\nfamily for any reason, and in particular, has not approached them since his visits to Syria, the most\nrecent being in 2005.  There is no evidence that his family living in Syria engages in activities which\nwould bring attention to themselves or that they are even aware of his work.  As such, there is a\nreduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Syrian government,\nwhich regularly seeks to quiet those which speak out against it.  Applicant deserves some credit\nbecause of the reduced possibility that Syria will exploit his family, but FI MC 1 cannot be applied\nin this case because even if there was substantial evidence of the \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key\nnoncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Syrian government has not contacted them about\nApplicant in the past, such factors are insufficient to support the application of FI MC 1\u201d because\nof the nature of the Syrian government and its relationship to the United States.  \n\nIn regard to FI MC 3, the Appeal Board had determined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country\n4\nmust be both casual and infrequent. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth whole\n5\nperson factor apparently without discussion of the other factors was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App.\nBd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole whole person factor mentioned is eighth factor in discussion of Judge\u2019s whole person analysis\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nFI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where \u201ccontact and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant has monthly contacts by\ntelephone with his family members living in Syria, has visited them six times in Syria, and sends his\nparents money.  FI MC 3 does not apply because his contacts with them are not casual and\ninfrequent. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with\napplicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per year not casual and infrequent); ISCR\nCase No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once\nevery four or five months not casual and infrequent).      \n4\nFinally, none of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative.\nRather, these circumstances must be considered together under the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d which\nincludes consideration of the absence of evidence concerning: his family\u2019s lack of governmental\nconnections; and the absence of financial dependence on the Syrian government.  On the other hand,\nthe nature of Syria\u2019s government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the United States\ncreate a very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns raised by the fact that\nthe Applicant has family members living in Syria. \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible, and there is no reason\nto believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm to his U.S. family or to\nthis country.  If the Syrian government should threaten harm to his family members living in Syria\nto obtain classified information from him or otherwise contact him, I am persuaded that he would\nreport this activity to the U.S. authorities.  There is no evidence that he has failed to follow the rules\nor failed to require those around him to do the same on projects requiring security clearances. There\nis no evidence that he lacks the respect and trust of his employer, his friends, and family or that he\nlacks honesty and integrity.  There is no evidence that he has revealed to his family in Syria the\nnature of his work or about applying for a security clearance.  I cannot, however, find that Applicant\nhas mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to Guideline B because the absence of evidence\ndoes not overcome the heavy burden the Appeal Board has placed on applicant\u2019s similarly situated.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors which are used for\n\u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Foreign influence and foreign preference do not involve misconduct,\nvoluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc.  Accordingly, the eighth\nadjudicative process factor is probably the most relevant.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.  The eighth factor\nprovides, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d   Syria\u2019s government is\n5\n\nfor Iranian-American\u2019s case).  \nCompare ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 2 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006) (noting Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic\n6\npotential for exploitation\u201d but affirming denial of clearance based on contacts with Iranian family members); with ISCR\nCase No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe\nrealistic potential for exploitation\u201d).\nThere is no record evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s testimony that establishes: (1) any connection or contact\n7\nbetween Applicant and any foreign government; (2) any financial interests between Applicant and any foreign nation,\nor any foreign business concern; (3) his failure to follow the rules or his failure to require those around him to do the\nsame on projects requiring security clearances; (4) any lack of the respect and trust of his employer, his friends, or family;\nand (5) a problem in the areas of honesty or integrity.  I conclude, however, that the government has no burden to present\nsuch evidence, and the absence of evidence does not support application of any mitigating conditions.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-21927, 2006 DOHA LEXIS 229, at *39-*41 (A.J. May 17, 2006) (discussing absence of evidence and\nrelationship to burden shifting).\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

He has frequent contact with them.  Under\nthe circumstances, there is a significant possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.  \nAs indicated in the statement of facts, there are many other countervailing, positive attributes\nto Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting a clearance.  He is patriotic, loves\nthe United States, and would not permit Syria to exploit him.  He has close ties to the United States.\nHe is a U.S. citizen and has lived his adult life in the U.S.  His older brother lives in the U.S.  He\nowns property in the United States, and his parents and younger brother are in the process of moving\nto the United States.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis in a Guideline B case should include \u201cthe totality\nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstance[s] (including the realistic potential for exploitation)\u201d as\nwell as the eighth factor discussed in the previous paragraph.   In this case, Applicant\u2019s potential for\n6\nexploitation is low.  I base this finding on his credible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe\nhe would compromise national security, or otherwise comply with any Syrian threats.  However, the\nabsence of evidence  under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence is of very limited probative value, and\n7\ninformation about his strong connections to the United States are insufficient to outweigh the\nGuideline B concerns.  See n. 30, supra. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\nall the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  \nBased on the Appeal Board\u2019s Guideline B jurisprudence pertaining to cases involving Syrian-\nAmericans, who have frequent contacts with family members living in Syria, Applicant\u2019s security\neligibility and suitability cannot be approved.  I take this position based on the law, as set forth in\nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\n8\nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for\naccess to classified information.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKenneth M. Roberts, Attorney At Law\nSYNOPSIS\n  \nDue to stress and depression brought on by his mother\u2019s illness and eventual death, the\nApplicant ignored his legal duties and responsibilities and failed to file and/or pay his state and\nfederal annual taxes for tax years 1995, 1996 and 1997.  He has since hired an attorney who has\nassisted him in resolving his tax matters.  His history of alcohol abuse, resulting in 3 DUI\u2019s, the last\noccurring in 1999, over 8 years ago.  This aberration in his behavior also occurred during his\nmother\u2019s disease and death.  His financial problems, alcohol abuse and related criminal conduct\nhave now been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 22, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned Administrative\nJudge on June 20, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 21, 2007, scheduling the hearing\nfor July 25, 2007.  At the hearing the Government presented 13 exhibits. The Applicant called thee\nwitnesses and presented 32 exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through Z and AA through\nFF that were admitted into evidence.  The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.  The record\nremained open until August 10, 2007 for receipt of an alcohol assessment by the Applicant\u2019s\nphysician.  The Applicant presented two Post-Hearing exhibits consisting of eight pages that were\nadmitted into evidence, as Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non August 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 50 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Video\nTeleconferencing Technician,  and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nBeginning in 1993, the Applicant experienced an extremely difficult time in life which\ncaused him to neglect his duties and obligations, namely he failed to file his income tax returns on\na timely basis and/or pay his taxes, which caused tax liens to be imposed against him.  He explained\nthat during this time, his mother became ill, exhibiting psychotic decay at first thought to be\nschizophrenia.  Her paranoia and irrational behavior  were medicated, but her physical conditions\ncontinued to declined.  She was eventually diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s disease.  During this period,\nthe Applicant learned that the disease is genetically transmitted.   The Applicant watched his mother\nbecome delusional, psychotic and exhibit distorted behavior and thought that it likely that he may\none day be plagued with the disease. The Applicant became despondent and his feeling of\nhopelessness, unable to do anything about his mother, caused him to neglect his responsibilities and\nstart consuming alcohol to medicate his stress and depression.    \nIn November 1998, the State of California filed a lien against the Applicant for unpaid state\nincome taxes in the amount of approximately $19,590.00.  As of March 28, 2007, this debt had not\nbeen paid.  In an effort to straighten up his delinquent tax situation, in January 2006, the Applicant\n\n3\nhired a tax attorney to assist him in paying his back taxes owed and in filing his requisite income tax\nreturns.  Although the Applicant initially admitted the debt in response to his SOR, he had actually\nalready paid the debt and the lien was released in February 2006.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits Y and\nZ).\nOn July 26, 1999, the a state tax lien was filed against the Applicant for unpaid state income\ntaxes for tax years 1995 and 1997, totaling $27,314.14 in taxes, penalties, interest and collection\ncosts.  Although the Applicant initially admitted the debt in his response to the SOR, he is currently\npaying in the debt in the amount of $383.17 every two weeks, or $766.34 per month, which is\nautomatically deducted out of his payroll check.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit AA).   \nThe Applicant failed to file state income tax returns for tax years 1995, 1996,  and 1997.\nThis is a misdemeanor violation of the state\u2019s revenue and tax code, Section 19701.  The Applicant\nhas now filed his income tax returns for tax years 1995 and 1996.  He has not yet filed his returns\nfor 1997.  He testified that he has  informed the California Franchise Tax board that his 1997 return\nwill be filed before August 23, 2007, and indicates that he has been paying on his estimated earnings\nfor that year since June 2003.\nThe Applicant indicates that he did file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1995, and\n1996 in a timely manner.  However, he has not yet filed his income tax return for tax year 1997.  In\nregard to his taxes owed for 1995, the Applicant testified that his tax attorney is in the process of\npreparing an offer in compromise to pay those taxes.  For tax year 1996, the Applicant has a credit\nof $16,000.00 which will be applied to tax year 1995.  The Applicant submitted documentation from\nthe state tax authorities indicating that he owes a zero balance for tax year 1995 and 1996.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B).  He owes nothing to the IRS for tax year 1997.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nFrom 1993 through at least 1999, the Applicant numbed the pain of his mother\u2019s illness and\ndeteriorating condition by consuming alcohol to excess.  As a result, he was arrested on three\nseparate occasions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. \nOn June 26, 1993, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol.  On July 30, 1993, he was found guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine, to have his\ndriver\u2019s license revoked, and ordered to attend an alcohol rehabilitation program for 30 days.  The\nApplicant failed to complete the alcohol rehabilitation program.  Due to family problems,\nspecifically his mother\u2019s disease, he procrastinated and did not fulfill this obligation. \nIn the summer of 1995, the Applicant was arrested by the officials patrolling the Colorado\nRiver and charged with operating a jet ski while under the influence of alcohol.  He was found guilty\nand sentenced to pay a fine.\nOn January 15, 1999, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol.  On April 15, 1999, he was found guilty and was sentenced to 48 hours\nincarceration, to pay a fine, issued a restricted driver\u2019s license, and ordered to complete an 18 month\nalcohol rehabilitation program and attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  The Applicant again\n\n4\nfailed to complete his alcohol rehabilitation and attend the required number of Alcoholics\nAnonymous meetings.\nPresently, the Applicant has enrolled in alcohol rehabilitation courses and plans to continue\nwith the course.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit BB).\nOn July 30, 2007, the Applicant underwent a psychiatric and Substance Abuse evaluation by\nhis psychiatrist who states under his diagnosis, \u201cEven though he has had alcohol related problems\nin the past, according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association\nEdition IV-TR, he qualified for Alcohol Abuse syndrome rather than alcohol addiction.  The Alcohol\nAbuse was in conjunction with an Adjustment Disorder and Depression.  Since he has overcome his\nAdjustment Disorder, for him alcohol use is an option he can easily forego.  His use pattern does not\nqualify as a life-long addiction.\u201d  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, p. 7).\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant\u2019s failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 1995, 1996 and 1997,\nis a misdemeanor violation of the California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 19701.\nThe record evidence indicates that the Applicant did file his federal income tax returns for\ntax years 1995 and 1996.  His failure to file his federal income tax returns for tax year 1997 in a\ntimely basis is a violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203.\nHis two alcohol related offenses, namely DUIs that occurred in June 1993 and January 1999,\nalso exhibit criminal conduct.\nMitigation.\nThree witnesses, including coworkers, professional colleagues and friends of the Applicant\ntestified that the Applicant is extremely reliable, honest, loyal and forthright.  He has been observed\nconsuming alcohol and is considered a \u201csocial drinker\u201d on weekends.  He no longer drinks and\ndrives.  He was observed  intoxicated about a month before the hearing at a backyard pool party\nwhere he had been consuming margaritas and he did not drive home.  He is recommended for a\nposition of trust.        \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n5\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(d)  the individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts. \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22 (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\n22 (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence(if\nalcohol dependent or responsible use (if alcohol abuser).\n23(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of\nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholic Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a\n\n6\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who\nis a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n30 (a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n30 (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n32 (a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment;\n32 (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in excessive financial\nindebtedness, alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in Financial irresponsibility (Guideline F); Alcohol Abuse (Guideline G); and Criminal\nConduct (Guideline J).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under Guidelines F,\nG, and J of the SOR.\nThe ten through twelve year period of the Applicant\u2019s life when he neglected his duties and\nobligations under the law was an isolated period related directly to the disease and eventual death\nof his mother.  The pressures in his life that caused these aberrations have passed.  This is a situation\n\n8\nthat is not capable of being repeated and the Applicant has not exercised poor judgment outside of\nthis time frame.\nDespite the fact that the Applicant allowed his taxes to become delinquent, he has always\npaid his others debtors on time.  He has no other delinquent debts, no history of collection accounts\nor overdue bills.  He has one California tax lien that is currently being paid at the rate of $766.00\nmonthly and he has tendered a 20% payment of $3,200.00 to the IRS for a debt owed for federal\nback taxes owed for tax year 1995.  He hired a tax attorney to assist him in filing his income tax\nreturns and has now filed all of his returns except his returns for 1997 that are expected to be filed\non or before August 23, 2007.  His tax matters will be completely resolved soon.  Under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations, Disqualifying Conditions, 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts and 19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligation apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control,\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances and 20(d)  the\nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also\napply. \n     \nUnder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, disqualifying conditions, 22(a) alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent and 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent apply.  The Applicant has had three alcohol related incidents,\nthe last incident having occurred more than eight years ago, in January 1999.  He is currently\nenrolled in an alcohol rehabilitation program.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, in his evaluation of the Applicant dated July 30, 2007,  indicates\nthat under the circumstances he is considered to be an alcohol abuser.  The psychiatrist  states, \u201cHe\nhas risen above his problems and there have been no alcohol related problems since 1999.  The\nreason he was able to contain his beer drinking to a few on the weekends is because his underlying\npsychological makeup is not that of an alcoholic.  But since he values his position so much, he finds\nit easy enough to be totally abstinent like he has been in his life before.  He is no longer depressed,\nand he is retiring the debt from the last phase of his life.\u201d  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).\nMitigating Conditions 23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a\npattern of abstinence(if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if alcohol abuser), and 23(d) the\nindividual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with\nany required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly\nqualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized alcohol treatment program apply.\n\n9\nThe Applicant\u2019s willful failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 1995, 1996 and\n1997 is a misdemeanor violation of California Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 19701.  His\nfailure to file his 1997 federal income taxes is a violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section\n7203.  His alcohol related incidents concerning his DUI arrests in June 1993 and January 1999 are\nalso criminal conduct.  Under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions 30(a) a\nsingle serious crime or multiple offenses and 30(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted applies.\nHowever Mitigating Conditions 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment, and 32(d) there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement also applies.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct\nset forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good\njudgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating that the person will properly safeguard classified information.  \n Under the particular facts presented, this Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy,\nand that he does meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly,\nI find for the Applicant under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), G (Alcohol Consumption),\nand J (Criminal Conduct).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n10\nParagraph 3: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Tr. at 16. \nTr. at 31-33. \n3\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline\nD (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2007,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.   \n1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Administrative Judge erred\nin finding that Applicant had repeatedly exposed himself and committed certain indecent acts in front\nof children in November 2000; (b) whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance determination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law when the only evidence against\nApplicant is untried allegations that he had engaged in the sexual misconduct described above,\ncoupled with Applicant\u2019s 2001 decision to accept discharge from the Air Force under other than\nhonorable conditions rather than face court-martial on those allegations; and (c) whether the\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance determination is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law, considering Applicant\u2019s exemplary work history.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.31.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The Board does not review a case de novo. \nThe record evidence available to the Judge included the Air Force Office of Special\nInvestigations\u2019 police report implicating Applicant (Government Exhibit 3)  and Applicant\u2019s own\n2\ntestimony that he accepted the Air Force\u2019s offer of discharge knowing the nature of the charges\nagainst him, his right to contest his guilt at trial, and knowing what discharge under other than\nhonorable conditions meant.   The Judge also had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor\n3\nduring the hearing.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant had\nengaged in the sexual misconduct and that his claims of innocence were not credible, are sustainable.\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\n\nTr. at 81.\n4\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.\n5\nDirective  \u00b6 \u00b6 E2.2.2 and E2.2.3. \n6\n3\nBoard may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nThere is a presumption against granting a clearance.  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399,\n1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents evidence\nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating\nconditions.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the absence of any other prior or repeat incidents of\nsexual misconduct supports the finding that the sexual misconduct alleged in the SOR never\nhappened.  At his hearing, Applicant had argued that the Air Force\u2019s offer not to take his case to trial\nif he agreed to accept a discharge in lieu of court-martial, was an admission by the Air Force that it\ncould not make its case against Applicant.   Applicant also draws the Board\u2019s attention to his\n4\nexemplary work record and the six years that have passed since the incident. \nAn applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The fact\nthat criminal charges were dropped or dismissed does not preclude a Judge from finding that an\napplicant engaged in the conduct underlying the criminal charges.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11906 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10168 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2003).\nSecurity clearance decisions are not limited to considering an applicant's job performance or\nconduct during duty hours, but rather can be based on consideration of an applicant's conduct\nseparate from the work place. An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage\nin conduct that has negative security implications.  See ISCR Case No. 01-25466 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nJul. 22, 2004).  The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence\nin persons granted access to classified information.  Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n. 6\n(1980).  In assessing an applicant's security eligibility, the federal government can take into account\nwhether an applicant's conduct or circumstances raise questions about the applicant's judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness.  See ISCR Case No. 01-25466 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2004).\nConsidering the security concern surrounding Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct, the Directive\u2019s whole-\nperson factors,  and the \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d standard,  it was\n5\n6\nnot arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law for the Judge to deny Applicant a security clearance.  \n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael D.

Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant\nhad deliberately transported classified material to his private residence and stored it there are based\nupon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion under Guideline E was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; whether Applicant was denied due process of law; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions under Guidelines K and E are arbitrary and capricious in\nthat the Judge did not establish employer policies or NISPOM applicability during the times alleged\nin the SOR and in absence of evidence that Applicant stored classified material at his residence.\nFinding no harmful error we affirm.\n \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a defense\ncontractor.  From 1978 until 1989 he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy.  One of his Naval\nassignments was that of Engineer Officer for a nuclear submarine.  In October 1989, Applicant\nreceived nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for\nhaving failed to take prescribed actions in response to a valve problem on the submarine.  His\npunishment consisted of a punitive letter of admonition.  Applicant appealed the punishment, which\nwas denied.  His appeal was classified \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d and was not included in the report of\nnonjudicial punishment.  Applicant was subsequently detached for cause from the submarine for\nmisconduct and unsatisfactory performance.  Applicant resigned his commission and began working\nfor the defense contractor who is his current employer.  \nIn 2001 Applicant spoke with a polygraph examiner as part of an investigation for Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI) access.  He stated to the examiner that, during his NJP hearing,\nhe took notes and made photocopies of submarine operating procedures and that the information\ncontained in these documents was classified.  He told the polygrapher that he took the documents\nhome with him after the hearing and that he had maintained them at his residence ever since.  He\nfurther stated that he was unhappy with the Navy for having administered what he believed to be\nunjust punishment and that he kept the classified documents at his home due to having a \u201cvendetta\u201d\nagainst the Navy.  He stated that he had never compromised the information in any fashion.\nApplicant was subsequently denied access to SCI.  The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s statements to\nthe polygrapher were credible and that Applicant did knowingly transport classified documents from\nhis duty section to his private residence, maintaining them there from 1989 until 2001. \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\nFed. Rule Evid. 803(6).  The Federal Rules of Evidence serve as a guide in DOHA hearings.  Directive \u00b6\n1\nE3.1.19.  \nArticle 133, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Conduct Unbecoming an Officer.\n2\n3\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nApplicant contends that the Government failed to present substantial evidence that he had\nknowingly transported and stored classified information at his private residence.  We have examined\nthe Judge\u2019s findings and compared them with the record evidence.  The Judge based his findings in\nlarge measure on documents supplied by the Government, consisting of Applicant\u2019s NJP record; the\ndetachment for cause record; and the SCI denial record.  These documents are detailed, internally\nconsistent, and consistent with one another.  Furthermore, they constitute records of a regularly\nconducted activity, an exception to the hearsay rule.   Applicant has not met his burden of\n1\ndemonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings do not reflect a reasonable or plausible\ninterpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are sustainable.  See ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd.\nOct. 9, 2007).          \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).\nth\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nApplicant contends that he was denied due process in that the Judge concluded that his\nimproper storage of classified material at his residence violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(f) and 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 933.   Appellant argues that he did not have adequate notice that the Government intended to rely\n2\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-24965 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2003) (An applicant has a right under the Directive and\n3\nExecutive Order to have a reasonable opportunity to respond to adverse evidence.  However, this right is subject to\nwaiver through failure to take \u201creasonable timely steps to exercise it.\u201d)\nSOR \u00b6 2(b).  There are three allegations under Guideline E.  The other two will be discussed below.\n4\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006); ISCR Case No. 05-00488 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n5\n1, 2007) (\u201c[A] judge\u2019s application of mitigating factors must be conducted in light of the record as a whole.\u201d)  See also\nU.S. v. Bottone, 365 F. 2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 974 (1966) (\u201cThe trier is entitled, in fact bound,\nto consider the evidence as a whole. . .\u201d)  \n4\nupon these statutes, insofar as they are not referenced in the SOR, nor were they provided to\nApplicant as part of the pre-hearing discovery process.  However, at the beginning of the hearing,\nDepartment Counsel requested that the Judge take official notice of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793, in response to\nwhich Applicant\u2019s attorney stated that she had no objection.  Department Counsel did not request\nofficial notice of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933.  After considering the briefs of the parties and the record, we\nconclude that, by lodging no objection to the Judge\u2019s consideration of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793, Applicant\nwaived the opportunity to seek a continuance or some other form of relief if, in fact, at the time, he\nviewed Department Counsel\u2019s request for official notice as an infringement upon his procedural\nrights.   Regarding the Judge\u2019s references to Article 133 of the UCMJ, concluding, sua sponte, that\n3\nApplicant\u2019s conduct violated the UCMJ, such error is harmless in that it clearly did not affect the\noutcome of the case.  ISCR Case No. 03-09915 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-\n11192 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  While the Board believes that the better course of action under\nGuideline J would be for the SOR to cite the specific criminal statutes which an applicant is alleged\nto have violated, under the facts of this case we find no merit in Applicant\u2019s assertion that Applicant\nwas prejudiced by a denial of procedural due process rights.\nApplicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guidelines E and K is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  He argues first of all that he had successfully mitigated the\nGuideline E security concern pertaining to his NJP action.   Were this the only concern listed in the\n4\nSOR Applicant would have a point, the incident having occurred a relatively long time in the past.\nHowever, the Judge was required to examine this allegation not in a piecemeal fashion but  in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.   Viewed in this context, the Judge\u2019s decision on this allegation\n5\nis sustainable.  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s decision under Guidelines K and E is arbitrary and\ncapricious in that he had made no findings (1) that Applicant had stored classified information at his\nresidence; (2) that Applicant violated his employer\u2019s policies concerning the storage of classified\ninformation; and (3) and that Applicant had violated the NISPOM.  On this last point, Applicant\ncontends that he was not provided copies of all the various NISPOM provisions referenced in the\nSOR.  \nThe sole Guideline K allegation reads as follows: \u201cYou deliberately stored classified\ninformation at your private residence from about 1989 to at least July 6, 2001, without authorization,\nin violation of your employer\u2019s policies and procedures and in violation of paragraph 14(5) of DoD\n5220.22-M, Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information, March 1989;\nparagraphs 5-106, 5-300 and 5-306 of Department of Defense 5220.22-M, National Industrial\nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), January 1991 and paragraphs 5-100 and 5-304 of\n\n5\nDepartment of Defense 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual\n(NISPOM), January 1995, while employed at [federal contractor].\u201d  The SOR incorporates this\nparagraph in toto as a Guideline E security concern, in addition to the NJP allegation discussed\nabove.  It also includes under Guideline E the following allegation: \u201cYou deliberately transported\nclassified information to your private residence in about 1989 after serving on [a submarine].\u201d     \n  \nWe conclude that the first of the three alleged errors is without merit, in light of our previous\ndiscussion of the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s factual findings.  As regards the second, Applicant is\ncorrect, in that the allegation alleged a violation of the policies of his current employer, yet there is\nno evidence in the record, and therefore no finding by the Judge, as to what these policies are.  \nConcerning the third claim of error it is true that the Judge made no explicit factual finding\nregarding which portion of the NISPOM Applicant\u2019s conduct violated.  However, the Judge properly\ntook official notice of that portion of 1995 version of the NISPOM which includes the paragraphs\ncited in the SOR.  Applicant did not object. These paragraphs describe procedures for storing\nclassified information and permit a reasonable conclusion that Applicant\u2019s conduct was in violation\nof those procedures.  Furthermore, the Judge stated on the record that he would compare the 1995\nversion with earlier ones cited in the SOR to ensure that the provisions were similar.  Applicant did\nnot object to this course of action, forfeiting any claim of error as to inadequate notice.  The Judge\u2019s\nformal findings against Applicant under both Guidelines, at least as regards the NISPOM, are\nsustainable, viewed in light of the record as a whole.  Therefore, the error regarding the employer\u2019s\npolicies is harmless.  We hold that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is neither\narbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.      \n  \nSigned: Jeffrey D.
