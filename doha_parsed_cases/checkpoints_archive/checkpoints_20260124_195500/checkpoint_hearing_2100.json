Based upon a review of the pleadings \nand the documentary evidence, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 24, 2018, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). On \nOctober 15, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations), and Guideline M (use of information technology). The CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec.

He admitted some of the facts alleged \nin the SOR, but ultimately denied each of the SOR allegations. Applicant requested a \ndecision based upon the administrative (written) record without a hearing before an \nadministrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 1, 2021, Department Counsel prepared and sent to Applicant a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) with eight proposed exhibits, Items 1-8, attached thereto. \nApplicant received the FORM on April 5, 2021, and was advised that he had 30 days from \nthe date of his receipt of the FORM to file any objections or to supply additional \ninformation or documents in response to the FORM. He did not object or submit anything \nfurther. \nOn July 16, 2021, the case was assigned to me. I have admitted into the record \nthe evidentiary items attached to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM. The administrative form \nfor Applicant to elect to have an in-person hearing or to request a decision based upon \nthe administrative record without a hearing was missing from the file. Department Counsel \nsubsequently provided the form reflecting Applicant\u2019s request for a decision based upon \nthe administrative record. I have marked this form as Administrative Exhibit I. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old and has worked for several defense contractors since \n2004. He graduated from high school in 2003 and has taken some college courses. He \nwas first granted a security clearance in 2006, which was renewed in 2011.

Unauthorized access to employer\u2019s teleconference calls after \nemployment termination -  In April 2018, Applicant was terminated by this employer due \nto his failure to submit his SCA in a timely fashion and other issues. His employer \nsubsequently determined that after he had been terminated, Applicant had called in on a \ncompany conference line without authorization and listened to company-related business \ndiscussions without announcing his presence on the calls. The last time this happened \nwas on August 29, 2018, and Applicant was questioned by the company\u2019s security \ndepartment about his actions.

He was ultimately able to repay the debt owed on the card with a loan from his \nfather. (Item 3 at 34; Item 4 at 1; Item 7 at 6-7; Item 8.) \nIn an incident report submitted by the company, a company official asserted that \nApplicant had admitted attempting to enter a conference call in a text to a company \nemployee. The report also states that he admitted \u201ccalling into multiple program-based \ndaily status meetings during the month of August 2018, including as recently as August \n29, 2018.\u201d In his Answer, Applicant sought to dismiss the allegation as simply an \naccidental \u201cpocket dial.\u201d He admitted using a former co-worker\u2019s access code, which was \nsaved on Applicant\u2019s phone. He wrote that with the access code stored on his phone, it \nwas possible to \u201cspeed dial\u201d the number, even by accident, and enter the conference call. \nHe claimed that he never listened to the calls and hung up when he realized his mistake. \nHe has now deleted his former co-worker\u2019s conference number so that this mistake \ncannot happen again. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 2; Item 7 at 7-8.) \nI find Applicant\u2019s explanation about how he accidentally dialed into conference call \nat the time of company meetings to lack credibility. I conclude that his actions were \ndeliberate. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n2.a Loan account charged off in the amount of about $8,244 \u2013 In about 2015,\nApplicant opened this credit account to refinance a vehicle loan. He defaulted on his\npayments and the vehicle was repossessed in July 2017. The lender sold the debt to a\ncollection agency. In his Answer, he denied the debt on the grounds that the debt was no\nlonger owed to the original creditor identified in the SOR. This unpaid debt owed to the\noriginal lender is evidenced by the two credit reports attached to the FORM.

He relocated and started a new job that would permit a healthier lifestyle. He is \nreceiving financial advice from his father to improve his financial situation and repay his \nfather for the loan described above. His father is a financial advisor. Applicant is focused \non improving his health and lifestyle and wants to be able to have a family of his own. \n(Item 2 at 2.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15, which, in relevant \npart, provides, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nThe following conditions under AG \u00b6 16 have possible applicability to the facts of \nthis case and may be disqualifying: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources; and \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nAssuming arguendo that Applicant\u2019s actions on August 30, 2018, are not sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under any single guideline or that his actions are not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination, then AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d) have been established. The record evidence \ncontains credible adverse information, which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \nindicating that Applicant may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s actions of misusing his company credit card while employed with the company \nand misusing its conference call system after being terminated constitute \u201ca pattern . . . \nof rules violations\u201d and a \u201csignificant misuse of. . . [his] employer\u2019s time and resources.\u201d \nFurthermore, the evidence established the applicability of AG \u00b6 16(f). His violation \nof his employer\u2019s credit card policy violated the commitment he made when he became \nan employee that he would comply with its policies. Such a commitment was a condition \nof his employment. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Two of these mitigating conditions have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s behavior was not minor, remote in time, \nor infrequent. There was nothing unique about the circumstances of the behavior to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuggest that it is unlikely to recur. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his misuse of \nhis company credit card, but he has not acknowledged that he deliberately called in to \ncompany conference calls after his termination from the company. He has taken some \nsteps to change his environment that caused him financial stress, but he has not had a \nsufficient track record of mature, responsible conduct to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under this guideline. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe following conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \n7 \n \nThe record evidence established all three disqualifying conditions quoted above. \nApplicant\u2019s violation of his employer\u2019s trust by using his company credit card to finance \nlarge amount of personal expenses that he could not repay with his own funds is a form \nof deceptive financial practices falling under AG \u00b6 19(d). His past-due debt on his vehicle \nloan established AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), especially when considered in conjunction with his \ncompany credit card actions over a period of a year or more.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s misuse \nof his employer\u2019s credit card to finance his personal expenses occurred sufficiently \nrecently to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. The same \nis true with respect to his unpaid vehicle debt. Applicant has not established that the cause \nof his financial problems were conditions beyond his control. While he has repaid his \nemployer for the funds he misappropriated, that repayment was funded by his father and \nis a unique situation. Applicant stated that he has received financial counseling from his \nfather, but that counseling has not resulted in clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial \nissues are under control. Applicant\u2019s failure to initiate a good-faith effort to repay his \nvehicle loan after the vehicle was repossessed four years ago is more representative of \nApplicant\u2019s lack of willingness to initiate and adhere to good-faith efforts to repay overdue \ncreditors. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39 as follows: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe following conditions under AG \u00b6 40 have possible applicability to the facts of \nthis case and may be disqualifying: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system;  \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nThe record evidence established that Applicant deliberately used his personal \nmobile device to access his former employer\u2019s conference calls using the access codes \nof one or more of his former co-workers. Such actions constitute both unauthorized entry \ninto and unauthorized use of his former employer\u2019s information technology system in that \nthe employer\u2019s conference calls are a computer-accessed, information technology \nsystem. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 41 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Two of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s use \nof his former employer\u2019s conference call information technology system occurred \nsufficiently recently to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that the circumstances were unusual except for \nthe fact that he did what he did, which casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s assertion that his actions were inadvertent is \nnot credible. Moreover, he never made an effort to alert his former employer about his \ninadvertent \u201cpocket dials\u201d into company conference calls. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the \nwhole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, F, and M in my whole-\nperson analysis and considered the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional \ncomments are warranted. I have weighed Applicant\u2019s age and the lack of maturity \nevidenced by his actions. Also, I have considered his lack of remorse for his behavior. I \nacknowledge his statements that he has taken steps to improve his working and living \nconditions to create a healthier and more stable lifestyle and his efforts to become more \nfinancially responsible. He has not, however, established a sufficient track record of \nresponsible conduct to mitigate the security concerns raised by the facts of this case. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his personal conduct, financial considerations, and use of information \ntechnology. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a principal financial program analyst with her current employer since August 2014. She previously worked for other employers as a senior tax accountant (January 2012 \u2013 August 2014), senior tax analyst (October 2010 \u2013 December 2011), or tax analyst (January 2008 \u2013 October 2010). A 1997 high school graduate, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and she has earned additional college credits but no other degree. She has never served with the U.S. military.

Folks, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/14/2021 \nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 5, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \na Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories, and \nalso asked her to verify the accuracy of an investigator\u2019s summary of an interview. She \nresponded to those interrogatories and verified the interview summary on an unspecified \ndate. On October 20, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto her under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June \n8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the \nDCSA CAF adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated January 8, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to her by DOHA \non September 17, 2021, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, she was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on September 24, 2021. \nHer response was due on October 24, 2021. She chose not to respond to the FORM, for \nas of November 10, 2021, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me \non December 2, 2021. The record closed on November 10, 2021. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take Administrative Notice of certain \nunspecified facts pertaining to drugs appearing in four written submissions. She did not \nspecify the information that was considered significant, and she did not discuss the \npurpose of the request. Facts are proper for Administrative Notice when they are easily \nverifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, \nthe Government relied on source information regarding drugs and drug use appearing in \nthree sections of the United State Code (U.S.C.) and in a letter from the Director of \nNational Intelligence. The request for Administrative Notice was unnecessary because, \nas an administrative judge, I am expected sua sponte to take notice of Federal law and \nDOD policies. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative notice at \nISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize \nauthoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 \nS.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents).   \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nin the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct sections. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.c.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a principal financial program analyst with her current employer since August 2014. She \npreviously worked for other employers as a senior tax accountant (January 2012 \u2013 August \n2014), senior tax analyst (October 2010 \u2013 December 2011), or tax analyst (January 2008 \n\u2013 October 2010). A 1997 high school graduate, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, \nand she has earned additional college credits but no other degree. She has never served \nwith the U.S. military. She has never been married.  She was granted an interim secret \nclearance in September 2017, and has held that clearance since that time.  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nDuring the period commencing in about January 2000, and continuing until at least \nApril 2020, with varying frequency, Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose \nsubstance of choice was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana - a Schedule \nI Controlled Substance. (https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 \n(c); Item 2 \u2013 Answer to SOR, dated January 8, 2021, at 1) She acknowledged that during \nthe times of her admitted usage, she purchased the marijuana. (Item 5 \u2013 Response to \nInterrogatories, undated, at 9) In her SF 86, Applicant reported that she had used \nmarijuana \u201con several occasions in the last 7 years but I currently no longer use \nmarijuana.\u201d  She stated that she stopped using marijuana in June 2017. She explained \nthat she used it to help her fall asleep. She also added that she did not intend to use any \ncontrolled substance in the future. (Item 3 \u2013 SF 86, dated September 5, 2017, at 39-40) \nHowever, in her subsequent Response to Interrogatories, she admitted that she resumed \nusing marijuana in September 2017 \u2013 the same month she submitted her SF 86, and had \nused it two to three times per week during that specific month, with similar use occurring \nduring January 2019 and April 2020. (Item 5, at 9)  \nIn her SF 86, Applicant was asked if her use of the marijuana took place while \npossessing a security clearance, and she replied \u201cno.\u201d (Item 3, at 40) Her response was \nfalse, for she had admitted to using marijuana while possessing an interim security \nclearance which granted her access to classified and sensitive information. (Item 2, at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s future intentions with respect to marijuana use have been inconsistent \nand somewhat ambivalent. In her SF 86, she reported that she was no longer using \nmarijuana, and during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in September 2017, she stated that she had no further intention of \nusing marijuana again.

(Item \n5, at 6) \nPersonal Conduct \nAs noted above, Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance in September \n2017, and has held that clearance since that time. During that same period, as well as \nbefore and after that period, she routinely purchased and used marijuana. She remains \nunsure if she will use marijuana in the future. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . ;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser of a Schedule \nControlled Substance - marijuana. She frequently purchased and used marijuana for a \n20-year period, until at least April 2020. During part of that period she held an interim \nsecret clearance. Her somewhat ambivalent attitude regarding future marijuana use fails \nto clearly and convincingly commit herself to discontinue such misuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), \n25(f), and 25(g) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. After approximately 20 years of regular \nmarijuana use, Applicant continued using marijuana as recently as at least April 2020. \nShe was somewhat, but not fully, open about her use of marijuana when she completed \nher SF 86, and for that limited candor, she is given some credit. But, she was not fully \ncandid. She offered no substantial evidence of actions taken to overcome those issues, \nsuch as exploring drug treatment and therapy; changing or avoiding the environment \nwhere marijuana was used; providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, without any conditions; or evidence to support her \nclaimed abstinence since April 2020. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against her full history of \napproximately 20 years of marijuana use, the relatively brief period of one year a half of \nreported abstinence is considered insufficient to conclude that the abstinence will \ncontinue, especially after she acknowledged an uncertainty of her future intentions. \nApplicant made no statement regarding the legal status of her marijuana use. She \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseemingly ignored laws, rules, and regulations regarding such use. Her use of marijuana \nfor approximately two decades, despite the fact that such use was prohibited by both the \nFederal Government and government contractors, and her refusal to completely disavow \nfuture marijuana use, continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. In fact, the allegations under Guideline E are identical to the ones under \nGuideline H, and the credible adverse information alleged under Guideline H is sufficient \nfor an adverse determination solely under that single guideline. In this instance, the \nmultiplication of allegations under Guideline E added nothing to the allegations under \nGuideline H. In fact, that multiplication could lead to a conclusion that the Guideline H \nallegations might be too weak to stand without the allegations under Guideline E. \n \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions of the SOR \nallegations. Applicant did not controvert any of the Guideline H or Guideline E allegations. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. It includes: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nThe condition does not apply. While Applicant has acknowledged purchasing and \nusing marijuana for two decades, including a lengthy period during which she held an \ninterim security clearance, despite being aware of the Federal law, rules, and regulations, \nas well as with employment rules and policies, she is still unsure about future marijuana \nuse. She has taken no positive steps or efforts to seek drug counseling or therapy. \nApplicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct.

A 1997 \nhigh school graduate, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and she has earned \nadditional college credits, but no other degree. She was granted an interim secret \nclearance in September 2017, and has held that clearance since that time. She claims \nthat she has not used marijuana since April 2020. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. The fact that she held an \ninterim secret clearance from September 2017 to the present \u2013 something that would \nessentially be a positive factor \u2013 in this instance became a very negative factor because \nof her purchase and use of marijuana during that entire period. She lacked candor in her \nSF 86 and during her OPM interview. She remains unsure if she will use marijuana in the \nfuture, and thus, she failed to clearly and convincingly commit herself to discontinue such \nmisuse. She has not explored any possible drug therapy or counseling. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and personal conduct.

With no objection, those exhibits were admitted. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 28, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in October 2018. He experienced unemployment for approximately \ntwo months in 2014. He served in the Marine Corps for approximately 13 years, before \nhe was honorably discharged. He served a combat deployment to Iraq. He has a high \nschool diploma and has taken some college and technical courses. He married in 2008 \nand divorced in 2017. He pays child support for his two children. (Tr. at 5, 19, 21-24; GE \n1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed delinquent federal taxes in the amount of \napproximately $10,741 for tax year 2016; that he failed to file his 2017 federal income \ntax return as required; and that he owed federal taxes in the amount of approximately \n$10,067 for tax year 2017. He admitted the allegations in his SOR answer. He supplied \ndocumentation when answering interrogatories that supported the late filing of his 2017 \nfederal return and his delinquent tax debts for 2016 and 2017. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.b). (GE \n2; SOR answer) \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to a number of things. In 2016 he became \nemployed as an independent contractor rather than a direct employee. This change of \nstatus required him to account for and pay his federal taxes directly rather than having \nhis employer do the accounting for him through pay withholding. He did not receive a \nW-2 tax form from his contractor-employer, but rather a form 1099, which required him \nto account for his own federal tax liability. For tax years 2016 and 2017, he failed to \nproperly account for his federal taxes, which earned him the large tax delinquencies for \nboth years. His reason for not paying his required taxes for those years was because he \nwas supporting his wife and children and could not afford to pay his taxes with what was \nleft over. He testified that he had no excuse for filing his 2017 federal return as late as \nhe did, which was in May 2019. He also claimed that he contacted the IRS in 2017 and \n2019 to set up payment plans, but for some reason neither attempt was successful. He \nadmitted he did not really follow up on that issue. Since then, he claims he timely filed \nhis 2018 and 2020 federal returns, but he testified that he was not sure about his 2019 \nreturn. In his post-hearing documents, he provided a 2019 tax return prepared by the \ntax relief company (TRC) he hired to prepare his tax returns. It appears the return was \nto be electronically filed, but there is no date on the return or any other evidence \nindicating when it was filed. He is not sure if he owes federal taxes for year 2019, but he \ndoes owe some amount for year 2020. He believes his current federal tax debt is \napproximately $36,000. He did not provide documentation to support these assertions.

After that assessment, Applicant hired the TRC in June 2021 to review his \npast ten years of federal and state tax returns to determine whether there were errors, \nwhich could be corrected. The TRC will also contact the IRS to try to work out a \npayment schedule for him. As of the hearing date, no repayment plan had been \nestablished. Other than the TRC, Applicant has not received any financial counseling. \n(Tr. 20, 30-32; AE A) \n \n \nOther than his tax issues, Applicant\u2019s finances are in good shape.

(Tr. 19, \n24-29, 31; GE 2; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2017 federal income tax return, and he accrued \ndelinquent tax debt for 2016 and 2017. He provided documentation showing that his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017 return was filed two years late, but nothing to show that his tax debt has been \naddressed. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal tax return for 2017. He failed to produce \nevidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. He testified that \nhe is not sure if he filed his 2019 federal tax return. While he produced evidence that the \n2019 return was filed, he failed to produce any evidence indicating when it was filed. His \nhistory of non-filing or delayed filing of his federal tax returns calls into question his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s conversion from a direct-hire employee to an independent contractor \nand the attendant tax ramifications of that move were not conditions beyond his control, \nnor was providing support for his wife and children. He also failed to act responsibly by \nnot following up with his initial contacts with the IRS about establishing a payment plan. \nOverall, the record evidence does not support that Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. His delayed efforts to \naddress his tax issues by hiring the services of the TRC can be summed up as, \u201ctoo \nlittle, too late.\u201d He presented no documentary evidence that he was working with the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIRS to pay his large tax debt. He failed to put forth good-faith efforts to address his tax \nissues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), do not apply. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to filing his tax return, \nbut not to the payment of his delinquent taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military and federal contractor service, including his \ncombat deployment, his period of unemployment, and the circumstances surrounding \nhis taxes. However, I also considered that he has not addressed his tax delinquencies \nwith a payment plan or payments. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.b  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He attended community college and university from 2012 to \n2017, but did not attain a degree. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2007 to 2012, \nincluding a deployment to Afghanistan, and received an honorable discharge. (GE 3, \nAns.) Applicant was never married, but has lived with a cohabitant since September 2015. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2007 while he was on active duty.(GEs 3 \nand 4) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline J (criminal conduct), that in May 2007, Applicant \nwas charged with felony criminal abduction by force, intimidation or deception, and \nmisdemeanor sexual battery by force or helplessness. He was convicted of misdemeanor \nassault and battery, and sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nThe remaining Guideline J allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.j, alleged traffic violations to \ninclude reckless driving (all related to excessive speed) in July 2008, December 2008, \nApril 2009, and October 2010. He was convicted of misdemeanor reckless driving in all \nfour cases (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.e). In December 2014, he was charged and convicted of \nspeeding (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nBetween July 2012 and February 2014, Applicant was charged and found guilty of \nat least five motor vehicle equipment safety violations such as improper exhaust system \nand tinted windshield (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Between October 2012 and December 2014, he was \ncharged and found guilty of at least three motor vehicle traffic violations, including \nimproper lane change and disobeying highway markings or sign. (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Finally, in \nApril 2015 and March 2019, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor concealed weapon \nviolations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j). \nSOR \u00b6 1.a was cross-alleged under Guideline D (sexual behavior); and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.j, were cross-alleged under Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant admitted all \nof the SOR allegations, with explanations, except for the December 2008 reckless driving \nincident (SOR \u00b6 1.c.), which he could not recall. \nApplicant explained the circumstances of his criminal charges and motor vehicle \nviolations in his Answer to the SOR and in his personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \nby a Government investigator. The gravest charge, and one that is alleged under \nGuidelines J, D, and E, is the 2007 charge of felony criminal abduction by force, \nintimidation or deception, and misdemeanor sexual battery by force or helplessness.

No police records or contemporaneous witness statements were \nprovided in the record, and neither Department Counsel nor Applicant requested a \nhearing. \nApplicant explained that in 2007, while he was in high school, he and a female \nstudent had engaged in \u201cconsensual\u201d touching with each other over their clothes while in \nprivate. He was 19 years old at the time, while she was under 18. On another occasion, \nthey were walking to a bus stop after school while Applicant and she were \u201chorsing \naround\u201d and teasing. Applicant tried to convince her to stay with him until the bus arrived \nby pulling on her arm in a \u201ckidding\u201d way, but \u201cnot physically harming\u201d her. After she \nreturned home, she told her father about the touching and their behavior at the bus stop. \nThe girl\u2019s father called the school, and Applicant was called to the school resource officer \nand arrested. Applicant appeared in court and pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of \nmisdemeanor assault and battery. Applicant stated that he received a 12-month \nsuspended sentence and was put on supervised probation until he left for active duty in \nthe Marine Corps. Since that time, Applicant served about five years in the Marine Corps \nand held a security clearance. Applicant averred in his Answer that this offense occurred \n14 years ago, and that he and the girl were classmates and they \u201cfooled around a lot.\u201d He \nbelieves that her parents were unhappy with the relationship since the girl was under 18 \nyears old, and reported their activity to the school. No similar incidents have been reported \nsince. \nThe other serious charges involved misdemeanor possession of a concealed \nhandgun in a car, without a permit in 2015 and 2019. The 2015 incident resulted from a \ntraffic stop when the officer asked Applicant if he had a weapon in the car. Applicant \nanswered affirmatively, and showed the officer the handgun between the center console \nand the driver\u2019s seat and asserted that it was not concealed. The officer disagreed, and \nApplicant was cited, but the charge was eventually dismissed. The 2019 incident occurred \nwhen Applicant forgot he had a handgun under the driver\u2019s seat after leaving a shooting \nrange the night before. He put the gun there while he stopped at a convenience store \nbecause he could not legally carry it into the store without a concealed handgun permit \nand he did not want it visible in the car. The following day, he was stopped for having dark \ntint on his window. Applicant stated that he showed the officer a doctor\u2019s note permitting \nthe tinted windows, and he was free to go. However, before he left, the officer asked him \nif he had a weapon in the car and Applicant said no, having forgotten it was there. \nApplicant consented to allow the officer to search the car, and the gun was found under \nthe seat. Applicant was cited, but this charge was also dismissed. Applicant stated that \nhe obtained a state concealed handgun permit after the 2019 incident. In his state, a \ncounty district court judge issues the permit after a background check is conducted. \nI take administrative notice of laws in Applicant\u2019s state regarding the possession \nand transport of handguns and the issuance of concealed carry permits. Generally, the \nstate law in question permits the \u201copen\u201d carry of handguns without a permit (provided it \nhas a magazine capacity of 20 rounds or less, is not designed to accommodate a silencer, \nor does not have a folding stock), by any person over 18 years old.

Typically, in a vehicle, a firearm may \nbe considered \"openly carried\" if the firearm is openly visible. Generally, a permit is \nrequired to carry a concealed firearm in the state, including in a vehicle. A pistol may be \ntransported concealed, without a permit, if a person is at, or going to or from, an \nestablished shooting range, provided that the weapon is unloaded and securely wrapped \nwhile being transported. The facts in the record are insufficient to draw legal conclusions \nregarding Applicant\u2019s firearms activity or criminal charges. \nApplicant generally explained the circumstances behind most of the traffic \nviolations, and stated that since 2014, he has matured and become a safer driver, \nwatches for other drivers, obeys speed limits and signs, and cares for other people on the \nroad. Applicant acknowledged that his past irresponsible actions put others on the road \nin danger. Applicant also noted that he gets migraine headaches from a bright sun, so he \nhad his windows tinted. Once he learned that he needed a doctor\u2019s prescription for tinted \nwindows, he obtained one. In addition, since he unknowingly paid a loud exhaust ticket \nonline without challenging it, he has had another citation dismissed after showing that the \nexhaust system on his car is stock. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record, the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe Appeal Board has held in financial cases that failure to comply with tax laws \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government \nrules and systems. The same can be said for other laws and regulations in which we are \nexpected to follow. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, [such as filing \ntax returns and paying taxes when due], does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nHowever, mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a), (c), and (d) apply in whole or in part. \nThe most serious SOR allegation involved criminal activity with a minor. However, the \nfacts in the record do not support a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s activity when he was 19 \nyears old in high school was of such a nature as to create doubt about his current \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The conduct is dated, to say the least, and the \nrecord contains limited facts surrounding the incident, especially aggravating factors. \nApplicant was found guilty of a misdemeanor offense, but has since grown up, completed \nan enlistment in the Marine Corps and deployment to Afghanistan, and started a civilian \nwork life, with no similar conduct recurring. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) apply. \nThe traffic offenses may be compiled together to indicate a pattern of minor \noffenses that may cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment. Applicant attributes his traffic \nviolations to immaturity, a propensity for speeding, and at times, failure to assert \nlegitimate defenses or obtain the appropriate documentation. Overall I agree that his \nbehavior on the road until about when he turned 26 years old, was poor and disregarded \nthe law. However, the SOR allegations related to traffic violations are also dated. They \nare at least seven years old, with no evidence of recurrence. Based on this, I attribute \nApplicant\u2019s encounters with the law while in a vehicle to be evidence of poor, youthful \ndecision making that is unlikely to be repeated given his maturity and responsible \nemployment status. His past conduct does not cast doubt on his current judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness.

Applicant has since applied for \nand received a court-issued concealed carry permit after undergoing a background check. \nSufficient time has elapsed and no similar incidents have occurred. The conduct does not \nraise concerns about Applicant\u2019s current judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32 (a), (c), and (d) apply. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG & 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of sexual orientation of the \nindividual.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 13, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted.  \n \nThe evidence supports that Applicant committed a misdemeanor offense of assault \nand battery that involved a female high-school classmate that was under 18. He also \nadmitted to limited sexual touching with the girl, outside of their clothes, despite his claim \nof mutual consent, while they were in high school. The above disqualifying condition \napplies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom sexual behavior. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; and \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe conduct alleged and Applicant\u2019s subsequent conviction for misdemeanor \nassault and battery have been sufficiently explained and mitigated in my discussion \nabove. The conduct is significantly dated, occurred when the participants were teenagers \nin high school, has not recurred, and the facts paint an opaque picture of serious past \nsexual conduct that would give rise to questions of Applicant\u2019s current judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 14 (a) and (d) apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. \nThe personal conduct alleged in the SOR is generally sufficient to implicate AG \u00b6 \n16(c). \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above and incorporated herein, the record establishes Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of questionable conduct that resulted in a significant amount of interaction with \nlaw enforcement during his youth and subsequent early adulthood. Cumulatively, \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises doubts about his judgment, however, the mitigating factors \ndiscussed under Guidelines J and D above, apply to concerns raised under Guideline E. \nApplicant has honorably served in the Marine Corps and deployed to Afghanistan, has \nnot had a recurrence of criminal conduct of significance for several years, advanced his \neducation, obtained a concealed handgun carry permit, and established a mature lifestyle \nwith professional civilian employment. I do not expect that similar immature conduct will \nrecur, nor am I concerned about Applicant\u2019s current judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c) and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines. The record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns alleged. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFOR Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nGREGG A.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate drug concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a \nsensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 2, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline the DoD \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

(GE 1; Tr. 16-17, 21) Previously, he worked part-time jobs for \nother non-defense employers. (GE 1) Although both of his parents have held \nclearances, he has never held a security clearance. (GEs 1-2 ; Tr. 14) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nBetween March 2015 and May 2019 (while he was in college), Applicant used \nmultiple illegal drugs and prescription drugs with varying frequency that were not \nprescribed for him. (GEs 1-2) Drugs of choice that he experimented with at social \nevents over his four years of college attendance included the following: marijuana, \ninhalants, cocaine, hallucinogenics (inclusive of mushrooms and LSD), stimulants \n(inclusive of ecstasy), MDMA (\u201cmolly\u201d), PCP, ketamine, and prescription medications \nnot prescribed to him (Hydrocodone, Codeine, Promethazine. Adderall, Vyvanse, \nRitalin, and Xanax). (GEs 1-2) \nIn addition to using illegal drugs and prescription drugs not prescribed to him, \nApplicant purchased and sold marijuana with varying frequency between March 2015 \nand November 2018. (GEs 1-2) When asked about his past drug use in the electronic \nquestionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP) he completed in July 2019, and \nagain in his personal subject interview (PSI) conducted in August 2019, he was fully \nforthcoming with his voluntary disclosures of his past drug use. \nThroughout his four years of college, Applicant increased his drug use to almost \ndaily before reaching his senior year. (GE 2) Attributing his extensive drug use to peer \npressure from members of his fraternity, he tapered off his extensive drug use in his \nsenior year. (GE 2; Tr. 18-19) In the beginning, the drugs he used relaxed him, and as \nhe matured, they made him feel uneasy. After graduating in May 2019, and leaving \nschool to move back home and obtain full-time professional employment, he gave up \nillegal and non-prescribed prescription drugs altogether. (GE 2; Tr. 15-16, 23) Applicant \ncontinues to reside with his parents and has remained abstinent from all illegal drugs \nand non-prescribed prescription drugs. (Tr. 16, 31-32) \nApplicant attributed his drug activity in college to his desires to eliminate his \nanxiety and improve his ability to stay focused on his studies. (GE 2; Tr. 19) His drug \nuse did not cause him any financial or other personal strains in his academic life. (GE 2) \nMost of the drugs he acquired were from other students on campus who sold drugs, or \nfrom friends and acquaintances who shared drugs with him at campus fraternity parties. \n(GE 2; Tr. 15) He has never manufactured drugs and only sold marijuana, and not for \nprofit.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Drug Involvement \n \n           The Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because  such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple use, purchase, and sale of \nillegal drugs and non-prescribed prescription drugs over a four-year span while he was \nan engineering student in college (2015-2019). Considered together, Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement with illegal drugs and non-prescribed prescription drugs raise security \nconcerns over whether Applicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern misbehavior incompatible with \nthe judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining access to \nclassified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to using illegal drugs and non-prescribed prescription \ndrugs raises security concerns over risks of recurrence as well as judgment issues. On \nthe strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs \nfor drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a),\u201dany substance \nmisuse,\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of Illegal drugs \nor drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to sustained abstinence from all \ninvolvement in illegal drugs and non-prescribed prescription drugs since his college \ngraduation in May 2019. For over two years, he has remained abstinent from illegal and \nnon-prescribed prescription drugs and exhibits no visible signs or indications of \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nMoreover, Applicant has exhibited candor about his past involvement with illegal\nand non-prescribed prescription drugs, as well as his past associations with friends and\ncontacts involved in illegal drug activities and has shown marked improvement in his\njudgment and maturity level in the two years he has been away from the college\nenvironment that produced so much peer pressure from members of his fraternity and\nother contacts to engage in illegal drug activity.  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s assurances of sustained abstinence from illegal and non-prescribed \ndrug use are encouraging. And, his efforts warrant some application of two mitigating \nconditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 26(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her drug-   involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence \nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, \nincluding, but not limited to, (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuccumbing to any risks or pressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in \nthe foreseeable future. \n \n \n \n \n \nWithout more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence from \nthe use of illegal and non-prescribed prescription drugs, none of the mitigating \nconditions are fully available to Applicant at this time. With only two years of \ndemonstrated abstinen ce from illegal and non-prescribed prescriptive drugs, more time \nwith more corroborating evidentiary sources to support his continued abstinence are \nneeded to facilitate safe predictions that he is no longer a recurrence risk. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has established independent \nprobative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, maturity and good judgment \nrequired of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or sensitive position. \nHe lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in abstinence, however, to facilitate \nsafe predictions he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, there is insufficient probative \nevidence of sustainable mitigation in the record to make safe predictable judgments \nabout his ability to avoid illegal and non-prescribed prescription drugs in the foreseeable \nfuture. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s \ndrug activities over a four-year period with only two years of sustained abstinence, he \ndoes not mitigate security concerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.a-1.r. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n      \n \n \n \n   \n                           \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $24,678 for seven delinquent or past-due debts consisting of one medical account and six federally subsidized student loans (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). In response, Applicant admitted with explanations all seven allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since September 2018. Applicant and his wife married in November 2014. After graduating from high school, he attended college between 2012 and 2014. He left school before earning a degree to work in his father\u2019s small business in State A. Eventually, Applicant and his then fianc\u00e9e were the only two remaining employees in a company usually staffed by 20 people. They worked without pay until leaving after a falling out with his father in 2018. They then moved to State B, where Applicant obtained his current job, which requires a security clearance. (FORM, Items 4 and 6) Applicant obtained the student loans addressed at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.j to fund his college tuition. After his deferment ended, either he worked in jobs that did not pay well or worked for no pay in his father\u2019s business. He eventually defaulted on the loans in March 2018.

Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision \nwithout a hearing. \nOn July 21, 2021, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department \nCounsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) that was received by Applicant on July 27, 2021. The FORM contained \nsix exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit additional \ninformation. He did not submit anything further and the record closed on August 26, 2021. \nI received the case for decision on October 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $24,678 for seven \ndelinquent or past-due debts consisting of one medical account and six federally \nsubsidized student loans (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). In response, Applicant admitted with \nexplanations all seven allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since September 2018. Applicant and his wife married in November 2014. After \ngraduating from high school, he attended college between 2012 and 2014. He left school \nbefore earning a degree to work in his father\u2019s small business in State A. Eventually, \nApplicant and his then fianc\u00e9e were the only two remaining employees in a company \nusually staffed by 20 people. They worked without pay until leaving after a falling out with \nhis father in 2018. They then moved to State B, where Applicant obtained his current job, \nwhich requires a security clearance. (FORM, Items 4 and 6) \nApplicant obtained the student loans addressed at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.j to fund his college \ntuition. After his deferment ended, either he worked in jobs that did not pay well or worked \nfor no pay in his father\u2019s business. He eventually defaulted on the loans in March 2018. \n(FORM, Items 5 and 6) \nIn November 2019, Applicant was interviewed during his background investigation \nabout his student loan delinquencies, as well as about the delinquent medical account \nalleged at SOR 1.a. He stated that he would contact his creditors and establish a \nrepayment plan for his student loans and that he would resolve his medical debt. In his \nSOR response, Applicant indicated that he had paid the medical debt, and that account \ndoes not appear on the May 2020 credit report presented by the Government. SOR 1.a \nis resolved for the Applicant. (FORM Items 3 and 5) \nAs to his student loans, Applicant acknowledged in his Answer that those accounts \nare still delinquent. He did not produce any information, in response to either the SOR or \nthe FORM, that shows he has taken any steps to resolve his student loan debts. He also \ndid not provide any information about his current finances.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528,\n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that Applicant owes $24,678 for six past-due student \nloans. Those accounts have been delinquent for more than three years. Although it \nappears that he resolved a delinquent medical debt, this record does not reflect any action \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntaken to pay or otherwise resolve his student loan debts. This information reasonably \nraises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe Government\u2019s information presents a prima facie case for disqualification.\nAccordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on\nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. He did not do so. His\nstudent loan debts remain unresolved and the record does not contain information that\nindicates his circumstance and lack of action will change anytime soon. Applicant did not\nmeet his burden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification\nfrom access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \npresents unresolved doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. His ongoing financial problems leave him at risk of engaging in unacceptable \nconduct to resolve his debts. Further, his lack of action in that regard reflects adversely \non his judgment. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus in these \nadjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against allowing access to \nsensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

On October 20, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DCSA CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a date not reflected in the record, and requested \na decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 17, 2021, the \nGovernment sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 7.

The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted \ninto evidence. Item 7 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nHowever, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 7. The Government \nincluded in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 7 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also \nnotified that if he did not raise any objection to Item 7 in his response to the FORM, or if \nhe did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and that Item 7 could be considered as evidence in his case. As noted above, \nApplicant neither responded to the FORM nor objected to Item 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 53, is married with two adult children. He earned his high school \ndiploma in 1985. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a warehouse \nspecialist and maintained a DOD security clearance since 2014. He previously worked \nin the automobile industry. (Item 3) \nApplicant financed the $248,000 purchase of a home in September 2006 with a \n4.25% interest conventional 40-year loan. The monthly payment was $1,871. The \nlender foreclosed on the home in September 2018, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant \ndoes not owe a deficiency balance. (Item 2; Item 3 at 10-11, 40-41; Item 5; Item 6 at 49\u00ad\n50) \nIn his SCA, Applicant attributed this foreclosure to being unable to refinance the \nloan with a \u201cmanageable payment\u201d because he owed more than the market value. He \nasserted that he worked with the lender \u201cfor a while\u201d and made \u201cmultiple attempts\u201d to \nrefinance before he was informed of the foreclosure. In his SOR answer, he described \nthe foreclosure as \u201cthe best financial decision we could make for our family\u201d because \nthe \u201cactual value of the home was decreasing so much that letting the house go was the \nbest decision.\u201d (Item 2; Item 3 at 40-41) \nDuring his February 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant described facts \nand circumstances related to the foreclosure that contradicted the record and what he \nreported in his SCA and SOR answer. It is unclear whether he was: describing another \nforeclosure, confused about the facts, or being intentionally misleading. He mentioned \nthat his wife handled their finances, which could also account for the discrepancies. He \nreferenced a different address for a home in which he resided from 1995 through 2006, \nand different loan terms.

He estimated his combined federal \nand state tax debt to be about $30,000. He asserted that they were paying $500 per \nmonth to the IRS and, and that while his state debt had been paid off in TY 2016, they \nowed state taxes again in TY 2017. (Item 3 at 36-42; Item 7 at 2) \nIn his SCA, Applicant attributed his financial issues to an almost $20,000 annual \npay reduction resulting from a loss of income associated with his work as a commission-\nbased automobile parts salesman due to a \u201cdrop in business.\u201d He asserted that he had \nbeen working with his creditors to whom he explained his situation and was trying to do \nwhat he could to resolve his debts. He paid two of the three credit-card accounts \nreferenced in his SCA in 2013. In March 2019, Applicant outlined a budget with a \nmonthly net remainder of about $129, including expenses totaling $585 designated for \nhis state and federal taxes.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage foreclosure and failure to timely file federal income tax \nreturns or pay federal and state taxes (as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, 1.g, and \n1.h) establish the following disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged facts that potentially supported application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions with respect to his failure to file a state tax return for TY 2016. \nHowever, the mere absence of a tax return from an interrogatory response, without \nmore, does not suffice to establish SOR \u00b6 1.f. Thus, I find that allegation in favor of \nApplicant. \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s foreclosure did not result in a deficiency balance, the \nconcern is not with the foreclosure itself. Thus, I find SOR \u00b61.a in his favor. However, \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding the foreclosure remain relevant to my analysis \nof the history of indebtedness that continues to persist and his failure to timely file tax \nreturns. Applicant is credited with eventually filing his delinquent federal returns, making \n19 payments totaling $8,779 between July 2017 and May 2019 towards his TY 2015 \nfederal taxes, fully resolving his TY 2018 federal taxes in February 2021, and making \npayment arrangements at various times to resolve his delinquent state and federal \ntaxes. However, he did not meet his burden to establish mitigation under Guideline F. \nThe degree to which his underemployment in the automobile industry or other \nissues affected his ability to pay his mortgage loan and taxes was not fully developed in \nthe record. Applicant has not made any meaningful progress in resolving his delinquent \ntax debts since becoming employed in the defense industry in 2014. The record \nsuggests that he may have strategically defaulted on his mortgage loan by prioritizing \nhis self-interest above a legal obligation despite having the means to pay it. Although \nApplicant did not specify reasons for his late tax return filings, the record suggests that it \nmay have been due to a lack of funds to pay the associated taxes. The fact that he \ncould not afford to pay his taxes did not absolve him of the obligation to timely file his \ntax returns. \nApplicant has not established a sufficient pattern of regular payments pursuant to \nthe arrangements he made with the IRS and his state to resolve his delinquent taxes. \nHe has not demonstrated that his late tax return filings or tax payments were \nreasonable given his circumstances. In light of the record as a whole, his repeated \ndelays in filing his returns and paying his taxes call into question his suitability for \naccess to classified information. I am left with doubts about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.

The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe SOR alleged facts sufficient to establish the following disqualifying condition \nunder this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied deliberately failing to disclose information about his late tax \nreturn filings and payments. He contended that he misunderstood the question and \nbelieved that his \u201cno\u201d answer was correct given his interpretation of what was being \nasked. Not only was his interpretation incorrect, but the record facts do not support his \nclaim that, by the time he completed his November 2018 SCA, he had \u201cfiled taxes every \nyear.\u201d He filed his TY 2015 and 2016 federal returns (albeit late) before he completed \nhis SCA. However, he did not file his TY 2017 federal return until February 2019. \nAlthough the record did not substantiate the dates that his state returns were filed and \nreceived, he had not signed his TY 2017 state return before the date he completed his \nSCA. While he had \u201cbeen making payments to the IRS\u201d at the time he completed his \nSCA, he had not been making any payments towards his state tax debt. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNevertheless, when a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \nAppellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. An Appellant\u2019s level of education \nand business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose \nrelevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. \nIn this case, weighing in Applicant\u2019s favor is the fact that he put the Government \non notice that he had financial issues by disclosing a history of delinquent debts on his \nSCA. He also volunteered information about his significant tax debt during his interview. \nApplicant\u2019s interpretation of the tax question, while incorrect, was reasonable under the \ncircumstances. I do not find substantial evidence of an intent on the part of Appellant to \nomit, conceal, or falsify facts from his SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcern raised by his SCA omission. However, he has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by failure to timely file his federal tax returns and pay his federal and \nstate taxes. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(FORM, \nFORM 5 at 2; Response to FORM, Narrative and Attachment F) It is unclear whether the \nsurgery was an unexpected emergency surgery, but it was performed in far less than 72 \nhours after scheduling. This negated the hospital\u2019s requirement to have pre-admission \ntesting one to two weeks before surgery, and to preregister for surgery no less than 72 \nhours before surgery. (Response to FORM, Attachment F) To address her debts, she \nsolicited the aid of a debt resolution group. It has helped her address various debts \nthrough her regular monthly payments. (Response to FORM, Attachment G) In April 2020, \nshe told investigators that she has been timely on her obligations since December 2017.  \nAt issue in the SOR are six debts, noted in the SOR at allegations 1.a-1.f, \namounting to approximately $34,664. In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nresponsibility for all the debts except for the ones at allegations 1.c ($1,402), 1.e ($405), \nand 1.f ($132). The SOR allegations pertain to the following: \n1.a - $12,265 Repossession Balance \u2013 In repayment - Applicant admits \nresponsibility for this debt. It is the result of her having been a co-signer on an unreliable \nformer partner\u2019s car purchase, which ultimately resulted in his cessation of timely \npayments on the vehicle. She has started making payments on a repayment plan. She \nprovided documentation reflecting payment for October 2020 through January 2021, \nshortly before her FORM response was due. (Response to FORM, Attachment A) \n1.b \u2013 Poised for Repayment - $19,454 Charged-off Vehicle Loan \u2013 Applicant \nadmits responsibility for this balance owed. It is also the result of her having been a co-\nsigner on the same former partner\u2019s car purchase. As before, he ceased making \npayments on the vehicle unbeknownst to Applicant. Applicant laments having helped him \nget credit. She plans to start making payments on a repayment plan in March 2021, once \nshe has more disposable income. (Response to FORM, Narrative)  \n1.c \u2013$1,402 Charged-off Credit Card \u2013 Settled - Applicant denies responsibility for \nthis obligation.

She does not \nhave an extravagant lifestyle. (Response to FORM, Attachment 5 at 3-5) Applicant has \nsufficient income to continue satisfying her obligations. She does not anticipate future \nproblems with delinquent debt. (Response to FORM, Attachment 5 at 3-5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence showing the existence of six \ndelinquent debts, thus raising disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts, and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nUnder these facts, three conditions could mitigate related security concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIt is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s 2017 surgery was the result of an unexpected \nmedical emergency. The urgency with which it was scheduled and performed, however, \ntends to indicate it was neither planned nor elective. Moreover, she then appropriately \nretained a debt relief professional to help her address her debts, thus attempting to \nresponsibly deal with her debts and bills. \nThere is no documentary evidence showing Applicant has received financial \ncounseling. There is, however, documentation showing she has paid two and settled one \nof the six delinquent debts at issue, noted at allegations 1.e, 1.f, and 1.c, respectively. \nShe personally has begun repayment on one delinquent account (1.a), while her debt \nrelief program is currently negotiating arrangements to settle another account (1.d). Only \none delinquent account (1.b) remains unaddressed, but she credibly expressed her intent \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto commence repayment on it in early 2021 when she has more available cash. In light \nof these considerations, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old ISO III who has served in that capacity since 2014. She \nhas been continuously employed for over 20 years. There is no evidence of post-\nsecondary education. She is single and has one adult child. As of April 2020, the time at \nwhich her financial information was last examined, her modest net yearly salary was \napproximately $21,750. She manages her new and regular bills while also satisfying the \ndelinquent debts at issue. Applicant does not live an extravagant life and honors her \nobligations, leaving her a net monthly remainder of about $600 to $700.  \nIn 2017, Applicant began to acquire delinquent debt. This started around the time \nshe hastily underwent a surgical procedure. To help her manage the situation before \nthings got worse, she solicited the aid of a debt relief organization. It has helped her \norganize her debt, make payments, and seek settlement of accounts. Today, half of the \nsix delinquent debts at issue are paid or satisfied, one is in repayment, one is in \nnegotiation with the debt relief program for resolution, and one is poised to start \nrepayment this month. While Applicant has more to do to resolve all of her financial \nissues, she is well on her way to that end. She has the commitment and the finances to \ncomplete the task. In light of the foregoing, the progress noted, and Applicant\u2019s financial \nresources, I find that Applicant has mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n                       \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n_____________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On March \n2, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On March 29, 2021, DOHA advised Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel that his hearing would be conducted by video-teleconference on May 11, 2021, \nusing the Defense Collaboration Services. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented eight \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection. (Tr. at 10-11.) \nApplicant submitted five proposed exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E, which were admitted without objection. I sua sponte raised an issue regarding \nthe possible application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel and gave the parties two \nweeks to submit post-hearing briefs on the issue. Both counsel provided timely briefs on \nthe question. My ruling on this issue is set forth below. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 21, 2021.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 64 years old. He was formally educated through the eighth grade and \nlater received a GED high school diploma. While he was imprisoned during the 1990s for \nchild molestation, as described in detail below, he took some college courses. He first \nmarried in 1977. In 1974, his wife had a daughter from a prior relationship. Applicant later \nadopted his stepdaughter (SD) and gave her his last name. Applicant and his first wife \nhad two daughters of their own. They were born in 1980 (D2) and 1987 (D3). In 1991, \ntheir marriage ended in divorce. Applicant remarried in 1996 and divorced again in 2003. \nHe married a third time in 2005 and that marriage ended in divorce in 2007. Applicant and \nhis current spouse married in 2012. He and his wife have an eight-year-old daughter. (AE \nC at 5.) \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1974 at the age of 18. He served in \nthe Marine Corps until 1978. He then served two years in the inactive reserves. In 1980, \nhe enlisted in the U.S. Navy. While serving in the Navy, he held a security clearance for \nfive years. He was dishonorably discharged in 1995 after being convicted in a General \nCourt-Martial of committing indecent acts upon two minor children and served a term of \nimprisonment. (Tr. at 15, 17, 30, 49-52.) \nApplicant has worked for a U.S. defense contractor since 2004. In 2007, he applied \nfor a security clearance, but decided not to proceed to a hearing on his application. He \napplied again in 2019 with his submission of the current SCA.

The \nCourt-Martial was convened at an overseas Naval base (the 1987 Court-Martial). The \nCharges alleged that his crimes began in about March 1985 when SD was 10 years old. \nAt the DOHA hearing, Applicant testified that his sexual misconduct with SD actually \nbegan several years earlier. The sexual assaults continued for a period of time after 1985. \nHe was sentenced to confinement for 90 days, reduction in pay grade to E-5, and a \nreprimand. (Tr. at 33, 43, 54; GE 6 at 5; GE 7 at 3.) \nApplicant was released from the brig in October 1987 (1987 Release). Shortly \nthereafter, he was transferred to a base in the United States. His family returned with him. \nIn April 1988, SD, D2 and D3 were placed in the custody of the local county child \nprotective service. The local juvenile court permitted the children to reside with their \nmother on the condition that Applicant remove himself from the family home. He was \nordered by the court to have no contact with the children other than during supervised \nvisits. He testified that he and his family voluntarily participated in counseling for four to \nfive years. He also admitted, however, that the counseling was a requirement of the \njuvenile court. (Tr. at 22-23, 32-33; GE 6 at 5; GE 7 at 3.) \nIn November 1988, SD was placed in a psychiatric hospital for two months. She \nwas then transferred to a residential treatment center for an extended stay. SD advised \nher primary counselor at the treatment center that Applicant had returned to the family \nresidence in violation of the court order. She further confided that he had continued to \nmolest her after his 1987 Release until her hospitalization. (GE 6 at 5; GE 7 at 3.) \nAt the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he molested SD after his 1987 \nRelease and after his transfer to the United States. He also minimized the extent of his \ncontact with his children, including SD, at their home to one occasion when the girl\u2019s \nmother asked him to come to her home to help her by repairing her car. He admitted that \nthis was a violation of the court order (the One-Time Home Visit). He testified that it was \nthis unauthorized visit that resulted in an investigation of his contacts with SD, which \nextended to an investigation of his sexual misconduct with D2 and D3. He further testified \nthat his One-Home Visit was the reason he had to face a second General Court-Martial \nin 1990-1991. (Tr. at 22, 35-36, 53.) \nThe record evidence establishes that SD\u2019s allegations were investigated and \nApplicant was charged at a second court-martial with rape, carnal knowledge, sodomy \nand 11 specifications for indecent acts upon SD and two specifications for indecent acts \nupon D2 and D3. He was convicted of three specifications involving indecent acts. (GE 6 \nat 5.) \nAt the time of the court-martial in December 1990 and early 1991 (the 1991 Court-\nMartial), SD was 16 years old, D2 was 10, and D3 was 2. SD experienced extreme \nemotional difficulties, testifying on cross-examination about the details of certain of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nspecifications. The military judge, who was sitting alone without a jury, denied a defense \nmotion to strike all of SD\u2019s testimony, but allowed a portion of her testimony regarding two \nincidents that occurred during the summer of 1988 in which she described Applicant \nfondling her breasts. The basis for this exception was that SD responded to questions \nabout these incidents on cross-examination, which the judge ruled satisfied Applicant\u2019s \nright to confront his accuser. (GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 3-6.) \nOn direct examination, SD also testified that Applicant once tied her to her bed, \nhad sexual intercourse with her, and then untied her and performed anal sodomy on her. \nShe also testified that Applicant had penetrated her with a vibrator. Due to her extreme \nemotional distress, SD refused to respond to further questions on direct examination and \nto any questions on cross-examination about being tied to her bed and Applicant\u2019s sexual \nbehavior on that occasion. One of the specifications alleged against him was that he also \npenetrated SD with a banana and carrots. The judge granted a defense motion for a \nfinding of not guilty to Charges I and II alleging rape and sodomy and Specifications 3 \nthrough 11 of Charge III, which alleged various indecent acts upon SD during the period \nOctober 1987, after Applicant\u2019s release from the brig, to April 1989. The judge\u2019s ruling \nwas based upon SD\u2019s inability to participate in cross-examination on those issues, which \ndenied Applicant his confrontation right. In June 1991, Applicant was convicted of two \nindecent acts involving SD, Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge III, which alleged that \nApplicant fondled her breasts on two occasions and one specification of indecent acts \ninvolving Applicant\u2019s baby girl, D3. (GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 3-6.) \nD2 testified at the 1991 Court-Martial that Applicant had sexually molested her by \nfondling her breasts and vaginal area. She also testified that she had seen Applicant tie \nSD to her bed and have sex with her. She further testified that on one occasion she \nobserved Applicant digitally penetrate D3 while changing her diapers. The military judge \ndismissed the specification alleging indecent acts with D2 on the basis that the acts \noccurred beyond the statute of limitations. Applicant was convicted of one specification \nof indecent act involving D3. (GE 6 at 5-6.) \nApplicant was sentenced to six years imprisonment, total forfeitures of all pay and \nallowances, reduction to pay grade E-1, and a dishonorable discharge. He was released \nafter serving four years in prison. His conviction was upheld on appeal by the U.S. Navy-\nMarine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals. The court concluded, inter alia, that the record \nevidence supported the military judge\u2019s findings of Applicant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable \ndoubt to the specifications of indecent acts involving SD and D3. The three-judge panel \nof the appellate court also added, \u201cwe, too, are convinced of the [Applicant\u2019s] guilt beyond \nany reasonable doubt.\u201d (Tr. at 30; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 12.) \nApplicant did not testify at the 1991 Court-Martial. At the DOHA hearing, he \nrepeatedly denied that he engaged in any sexual misconduct with SD, D2, or D3 after his \n1987 Release. He also claimed that the only reason he was prosecuted in the 1991 Court-\nMartial was his One-Time Home Visit. Applicant also testified that the charges raised in \nthe 1991 Court-Martial were the same charges involving his indecent acts against SD \nprior to his guilty plea in July 1987.

While Applicant \nwas relieved of criminal responsibility for indecent acts on D2 due to the statute of \nlimitations, he was found guilty of indecent acts of SD and D3. he was found guilty of \nindecent acts on SD and D3. (Tr. at 21, 22, 52, 53, 55-56.) \nCollateral Estoppel \nAt his DOHA hearing, Applicant testified that he did not commit the crimes he was \nconvicted of after his 1987 Release. These crimes were the subject of the 1991 Court-\nMartial. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s post-hearing brief on the issue of collateral estoppel \npersuasively established that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars Applicant from \nrelitigating his guilt in the instant proceedings. In her post-hearing brief, Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel\u2019s agreed that Applicant is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of his \nguilt as determined in the 1991 Court-Martial. Department Counsel in her post-hearing \nbrief cited a number of DOHA Appeal Board decisions as to what has become \u201cblack \nletter law\u201d at DOHA on the issue of collateral estoppel. One of the precedents she cited \nwas the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, \n2006), which is the authoritative precedent on the issue. She argued that the three \nrequirements set forth in that Appeal Board case are satisfied in the instant matter. One, \nApplicant was found guilty in the Court-Martial of the criminal charges that are the subject \nof SOR allegations 1.c and part of 2.a. Therefore, the issue of his guilt is the same in both \nthe court-martial and the DOHA proceeding. Two, he was given a full and fair opportunity \nto litigate his claims of innocence in the 1991 Court-Martial. And three, the application of \ncollateral estoppel in the DOHA proceeding does not result in any unfairness to Applicant. \nI agree with Department Counsel\u2019s argument and rule that Applicant is collaterally \nestopped from challenging his conviction of crimes in the 1991 Court-Martial. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel argued in her brief that at the DOHA hearing Applicant did not \nintend to relitigate the charges of which he was found guilty in the 1991 Court-Martial. \nRather, he was just disputing the charges \u201cas he did during those proceedings when the \ncharges were brought against him.\u201d She argued, in other words, he was just consistently \nmaintaining his innocence. She argued further that Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his \ninnocence of the charges was solely to provide his perspective on the charges, which \n\u201cpertains to mitigation of those charges.\u201d However Applicant\u2019s position is interpreted, it is \nclear that he does not presently take responsibility for the crimes of which he was \nconvicted by the military judge in June 1991.

Applicant\u2019s testimony \nabout the One-Time Home Visit to his family\u2019s home lacked credibility in light of the \ntestimony at the 1991 Court-Martial of the acts of child abuse committed over a period of \ntime after his 1987 Release and after the juvenile court\u2019s restraining order. (Tr. at 54-55, \n58; GE 6; GE 7.) \nI also found Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing to be unconvincing and \ninconsistent with someone who was reliably telling the truth. While he testified that he \naccepted responsibility for the emotional damage he caused to his children, his testimony \nrelied excessively on how well his children treat him today, suggesting that all has been \nforgiven and was never a serious problem in the first place. He has no explanation for the \nhighly damaging testimony of both SD and D2 against him, which renders his claims of \ninnocence completely unpersuasive. Also, he never spoke with SD and D2 as to why they \ntestified as they did if their testimony was not true. (Tr. at 14, 26-27, 31, 41, 43-45, 61.) \nCharacter Evidence \nWhile serving in the Marine Corps and the Navy, Applicant received several \nmedals and ribbons. Applicant\u2019s separation from the Marine Corps was characterized in \nhis DD 214 as \u201cHonorable.\u201d As noted above, his discharge from the Navy was \ncharacterized as \u201cDishonorable.\u201d The President of his employer since 2004 wrote a letter \nof recommendation in which he characterized Applicant as \u201ca wholesome, caring and \nrespected individual by his superiors and subordinates (sic).\u201d He also describes Applicant \nas \u201cloyal, trustworthy, and dependable.\u201d Applicant also submitted into the record a \nDecember 2020 Letter of Appreciation signed by his employer\u2019s President stating that \nApplicant is \u201can invaluable asset to the company.\u201d Applicant has received several awards \nfrom his employer. (Tr. at 15, 18-19; GE 4 at 4, 5: AE A at 1, 2; AE E at 11.) \nApplicant also submitted an eight-page psychological evaluation performed by a \nlicensed psychologist. His report is filled with factual statements that vary from the court-\nmartial record summarized above. Most significantly, the psychologist makes no mention \nin his evaluation of the charges Applicant was convicted of in 1991. He only refers to the \nOne-Time Home Visit as a violation of a restraining order that resulted in Applicant \nreceiving a six-year prison sentence. The evaluation makes no mention of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued sexual abuse of SD and his abuse of D3, a two-year old baby girl, after his \n1987 Release. These omissions seriously undermine the persuasiveness of the \npsychologist\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201cis fully rehabilitated from his crime of 30 years \nago,\u201d that \u201che poses no risk of reoffending,\u201d that he \u201cis not susceptible to blackmail based \nupon his prior offenses,\u201d and that he is \u201cfit to hold a security clearance.\u201d(AE C at 8.) \nApplicant testified that he has not engaged in any criminal behavior or sexual \nmisconduct since 1991 when he was convicted and sentenced to confinement. He \ntestified that he takes full responsibility for his actions against SD prior to 1987.

(Tr. at 20, 26, 28-29, 52. 55-56.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n7 \n\n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nSexual Behavior \nThe security concern under this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 12 as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline at AG & 13 contains five potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. Two conditions apply to the facts found in this case: \n(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nThe record evidence established that Applicant committed serious acts of sexually \nmolesting two children after his 1987 Release. Applicant strenuously denies the \nallegations. These criminal acts are so abhorrent that they leave Applicant vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. This is particularly true because Applicant has not taken \nresponsibility for the serious sexual crimes he committed and of which he was convicted \nin 1991. He went so far as to misrepresent to the evaluating licensed psychologist the \ntrue reason for his four-year imprisonment. His testimony that he only visited his family \nhome once to fix a car problem lacked any semblance of credibility in light of the record \nas a whole. The record evidence raises serious security concerns under the above \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 14 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior. Two of the conditions potentially apply: \n(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred many \nyears ago. The behavior, however, is of such an extraordinarily shocking nature and \noccurred over a lengthy period of time involving minor children that it casts serious doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. Applicant\u2019s misleading \nattempts to deny and hide his conduct in the period after his 1987 Release is particularly \ntroubling. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not established. Although Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred a \nnumber of years ago, the seriousness of the nature of his sexual behavior renders it an \nongoing basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. This risk is emphasized by the fact \nthat Applicant continues to deny any improper sexual behavior with SD and D3, \nnotwithstanding his conviction for those crimes. Security concerns under Guideline D are \nnot mitigated.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG & 31 contains five potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. Two conditions apply to the facts found in this case: \n(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \nThe record established by more than substantial evidence that Applicant \ncommitted the serious crimes of indecent acts against SD and D3.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(e) apply. The record evidence raises security \nconcerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nrebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. Two of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred more \nthan 30 years ago. The conduct, however, did not occur under any unusual circumstances \nto suggest that the crimes would not have occurred had the circumstances been different. \nWhether such conduct might recur is speculative. I find the expert opinion of Applicant\u2019s \nevaluating psychologist to be of limited usefulness because he did not consider the highly \nrelevant fact that Applicant was found guilty of new charges of indecent acts in the 1991 \nCourt-Martial. Applicant\u2019s serious criminal conduct and his denial at the DOHA hearing of \nhis conduct after his 1987 Release cast serious doubts on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is only partially established. A significant amount of time has passed \nsince Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and Applicant has not been accused of any further \ncriminal conduct of any nature. Applicant served four years in prison. He has been \nemployed with a U.S. defense contractor since 2002, and his employer supports his \napplication for a security clearance even though he is aware of Applicant\u2019s serious past \ncriminal conduct. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for all of \nhis criminal conduct seriously undercuts all of his evidence of rehabilitation. Security \nconcerns under Guideline J are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. I have given weight to Applicant\u2019s military service over a number of years and \nhis many years of highly valued work with his current employer. I have also considered \nthe significance of the fact that Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual behavior occurred more than \n30 years ago. All of this evidence, however, does not mitigate the seriousness of \nApplicant\u2019s behavior with his stepdaughter and his two-year-old birth daughter. A \nsignificant fact in this whole-person analysis is Applicant\u2019s present failure to accept \nresponsibility for the crimes of which he was convicted in the 1991 Court-Martial. Overall, \nthe record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D and J and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to satisfy his \nburden to mitigate security concerns arising from his past sexual behavior and criminal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. (Tr. 6) He\u2019s a self-employed consultant working as a senior software engineer for a federal contractor. (Tr. 5-6, 21) He has worked as a self- employed consultant from 2010 to present. Before that, he worked as a senior software engineer for a federal contractor during 2008-2010. He has two-plus years of college education but not a degree. He is married, and he and his spouse have a teenager at home. He has a 21-year-old child from a previous relationship who does not live in his household. The SOR concerns a history of income-tax problems consisting of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013-2017, as well as back taxes owed to the IRS and the state tax authority. Applicant does not dispute or contest the SOR allegation. He disclosed his income-tax problems when he completed 2 his 2019 security clearance application in which he reported failure to file income tax returns for tax year 2013, and he estimated that he owed the IRS $150,000. (Exhibit 1) He also stated that he filed the past-due returns in June 2019 and was working with the IRS to repay the back taxes. During his 2019 background investigation, Applicant explained that he failed to file tax returns for tax year 2013 because he lacked sufficient funds to pay the amount due. (Exhibit 2 at 6-7) The situation then continued for tax years 2014, 2015, 201",

It is far too soon to tell if \nhe will succeed in making payment arrangements with the IRS or the state and then \ncomply with those arrangements. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 1, 2019. (Exhibit 1) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF \n86 is commonly known as a security clearance application. He provided additional \ninformation when interviewed as part of a background investigation in 2019. (Exhibit 2) \nThereafter, on November 27, 2020, after reviewing the available information, the DoD \nCAF, Fort Meade Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 31, 2020. He admitted the sole SOR \nallegation, which alleged failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2013-2017, although they were filed untimely in 2019; and he admitted owing \napproximately $75,000 in total for back taxes owed to the IRS and the state tax \nauthority. By combining all these various matters in the sole allegation pleaded, the \nSOR succeeded in being both duplicitous and ambiguous, which are practices to be \navoided. He also requested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to an administrative judge on March 3, 2021, and the \ncase was scheduled for hearing on July 28, 2021. The case was reassigned to me on \nJuly 26, 2021, and I postponed the scheduled hearing because Applicant was \nrecovering from a medical procedure. The hearing occurred as rescheduled on August \n18, 2021. (Tr. 8-9) The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on August 26, 2021. \nThe record was kept open for 30 days to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit \ndocumentary evidence, as he submitted nothing during the hearing. On September 16,\n2021, I received a 14-page fax from a law firm that has been assisting Applicant with\nresolving his federal income tax issues since August 27, 2021. The 14-page fax is\nadmitted without objection as Exhibit A. In addition, after the record closed, on October\n5, 2021, I received an e-mail from the same law firm with an update on the status of \nApplicant\u2019s case with the IRS. The e-mail chain is admitted without objection as Exhibit\nB. I again closed the record at that point.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. (Tr. 6) He\u2019s a self-employed consultant working as a senior \nsoftware engineer for a federal contractor. (Tr. 5-6, 21) He has worked as a self-\nemployed consultant from 2010 to present. Before that, he worked as a senior software \nengineer for a federal contractor during 2008-2010. He has two-plus years of college \neducation but not a degree. He is married, and he and his spouse have a teenager at \nhome. He has a 21-year-old child from a previous relationship who does not live in his \nhousehold. \nThe SOR concerns a history of income-tax problems consisting of Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013-2017, as well \nas back taxes owed to the IRS and the state tax authority. Applicant does not dispute or \ncontest the SOR allegation.

(Exhibit 1) \nHe also stated that he filed the past-due returns in June 2019 and was working with the \nIRS to repay the back taxes. \nDuring his 2019 background investigation, Applicant explained that he failed to \nfile tax returns for tax year 2013 because he lacked sufficient funds to pay the amount \ndue. (Exhibit 2 at 6-7) The situation then continued for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and \n2017, until 2019, when he filed all the past-due tax returns as well as the returns for tax \nyear 2018. He estimated owing about $75,000 in back taxes. His tax returns were \nprepared and filed with the assistance of a CPA firm who was also assisting him in \nnegotiating with the IRS and the state to address his tax indebtedness. (Exhibit 2 at 16; \nApril 21, 2020 letter from CPA) \nDuring his hearing, Applicant attributed his history of income-tax problems to a \nlack of sufficient funds to pay the amount due when he prepared the returns for tax year \n2012 or 2013, and the problem snowballed over the next several years. (Tr. 25-26) His \ninability to pay was caused by a mistake he made when he incorporated his business, \nwhich resulted in more taxes owed than he anticipated. (Tr. 26, 36-41) He also had a \ntotal of about two years of unemployment during the period 2012-2019, and a child-\nsupport obligation for his oldest child who was then a minor. \nApplicant also explained that he was no longer using the services of the CPA firm \nto negotiate with the IRS due to the high costs. (Tr. 29) Instead, he had contacted the \nIRS and had completed a financial history form to get the process started. (Tr. 29-30) \nHe contacted the IRS in May 2021, which was sometime after he stopped using the \nservices of the CPA firm. (Tr. 33) He estimated owing the IRS about $157,000 in back \ntaxes, interest, and penalties. (Tr. 31-32, 36) He estimated owing the state tax authority \nabout $30,000 in back taxes, interest, and penalties. (Tr. 70) \nApplicant further explained that he was negotiating with the IRS to establish a \npayment arrangement wherein he would make several monthly payments (three to six) \nas a sign of good faith. (Tr. 68-70) At that point the IRS would release tax liens filed \nagainst his residential property. Applicant would then be able to refinance the mortgage \nloan and use home equity to make a lump-sum payment to the IRS. \nApplicant\u2019s gross income was about $135,000 for tax year 2020. (Tr. 70-72) His \nspouse had a gross income of about $160,000 for the same period. Applicant and his \nspouse file tax returns as married filing separately, which is a tax status used by married \ncouples who choose to record their incomes, exemptions, and deductions on separate \ntax returns. It is noted that separate tax returns may result in more tax with a higher tax \nrate, because the IRS extends several tax breaks (such as higher standard deduction) \nto those who file jointly. Applicant and his spouse have used this form of tax-filing status \nsince 2015, which is the year they married. \nBased on his post-hearing documentation, Applicant has now retained the \nservices of a law firm to assist him in resolving his federal income tax issues.

The attorney \nletter explained the steps Applicant had taken to resolve the issue with the IRS, \nincluding his attempt to refinance his mortgage loan and use the equity in the asset to \naddress his tax liability, but the option was unavailable due to the existence of the \nfederal tax lien. In the attorney\u2019s October 5, 2021 e-mail, the attorney wrote that the IRS \nhad tentatively agreed on the terms of a proposed installment agreement pending \nmanagerial approval, which could take a month or longer to obtain. (Exhibit B) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n1  Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent in deciding this case: \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nApplicant is now in partial compliance with the IRS, which means that he filed all \ntax returns, as required. His proof of filing is not documented here, but it is unnecessary \nbecause the IRS does not entertain negotiations with a taxpayer unless the taxpayer \nhas filed all required tax returns. Of course, filing returns is only part of the story. \nApplicant owes a sizeable sum in back taxes, interest, and penalties to both the IRS \nand the state tax authority. He presented no documentation to establish those sums, \nand so his estimates of $157,000 and $30,000 owed to the IRS and the state, \nrespectively, are accepted for the purpose of deciding this case. He may be near the \npoint of making an arrangement with the IRS, but he has done nothing with the back \ntaxes owed to the state tax authority, as he is waiting to see what the IRS does. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information.

Both are questions of fact that must be addressed. \nApplicant failed to timely file income tax returns and pay tax when due for five \nconsecutive tax years (2013-2017). He says he did so due to a lack of sufficient funds to \npay the amounts owed in 2013 and the problem then snowballed. He filed the past-due \ntax returns in 2019, but the tax indebtedness remains unresolved. Although I am \npersuaded that Applicant is not a tax protestor nor tax defiant, he was exceptionally lax \nand neglectful for a number of years. \nTo his credit, Applicant disclosed his income-tax problems in his 2019 security \nclearance application, and he provided additional information during the security \nclearance process. He has slowly been trying to take remedial action (since 2015 per \nExhibit A), but has not made substantial progress in resolving the tax indebtedness. His \nefforts to reach an arrangement with the IRS have been hampered by the existence of a \nfederal tax lien, which is not surprising given that he owes six-figures to the IRS. (A \ncopy of the tax lien is not in evidence as neither party offered it.) With that said, it \nappears that he may be close to making an arrangement with the IRS based on his \npost-hearing documentation. (Exhibits A and B) But at this point the bottom line is that \nhe owes a total of about $190,000 to the IRS and the state tax authority, and he is yet to \nmake a single payment toward that tax indebtedness. \nConsidering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if \nApplicant will succeed in making payment arrangements with the IRS or the state and \nthen comply with those arrangements. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 \n20(g) applies, in part, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify complete mitigation of \nhis long-standing history of income-tax problems. \n6 \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline \nand that may indicate an emotional, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;                                                                                                    \n(b) opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual \nhas a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. \nApplicant received treatment in 2007, and was diagnosed in 2019 by an LCP as \nsuffering from Stimulus Use Disorder, Severe (In Sustained Remission). Therefore, AG \n\u00b6 28 is established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may be applicable: \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and \nhas a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAccording to the Government\u2019s LCP in 2019, Appellant\u2019s condition is \u201cIn \nSustained Remission,\u201d and was based on the use of an illegal stimulus, \nmethamphetamine. There is absolutely no showing of any current drug abuse, since a \none tine usage in 2017, about four years ago. More recently in 2021, Applicant\u2019s LP \nfound no current mental health disorder. Therefore, AG \u00b6 29 is established. I find there \nis no indication of a current problem. Psychological Conditions is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well respected at work \nand in her community. (AppXs A and B.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from \nher Psychological Conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on October \n10, 2021. Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not \nmitigated financial consideration security concerns. \nProcedural Issue \nApplicant\u2019s objection to the report of subject interview (Item 5) was sustained and \nwithdrawn by the Government. His objection to FORM Items 6 and 7, both credit reports, \nwere overruled by me as this is settled Appeal law that the Directive prescribes a broad \nevidentiary parameter \u201cto permit the development of a full and complete record\u201d in DOHA \nhearings, allows for technical rules of evidence to be relaxed, except as otherwise \nprovided in the Directive. There is no requirement under the Directive, Executive Order \n10865, or DOHA case law that all evidence must be obtained by an investigator as part \nof a security clearance investigation. The Appeal Board has routinely upheld the \nadmission of evidence obtained after the investigation, including credit reports, under \nParagraph 20. There is no harm or prejudice to an applicant simply because evidence is \nobtained by someone other than a security clearance investigator. (See Reply by \nGovernment to Applicant\u2019s objections.) Appendix C \nGovernment Items 2 through 10, and Appendix C are entered into the record. \nGovernment Item 5, as stated is withdrawn. Applicant\u2019s exhibits AE A through U are \nentered into the record (105 pages). His response to the FORM, including three more \nexhibits are entered into the record as AE V. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \n1.f, 1.h, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g with explanations. (Answer, Item 3) Applicant, age 46, \nis not married and has one minor son. (Item 1) He obtained his undergraduate degree in \n1998, his real estate license in 2004, and his master\u2019s degree in 2004. He is the owner of \ntwo private businesses, a consulting company from 2010 and a real estate company from \nApril, 2021. (AE M, N) Applicant completed his security clearance application on August \n5, 2018. (Item 4) He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 1) He has been with \nhis current employer since July 2018. (Item 4) \nFINANCIAL \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt totaling $98,636, including \nfour consumer accounts, two medical accounts, and a significant past-due child support \narrearage. (Item 6) The SOR further alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2017 Federal \nincome tax return. (Item 1) \nApplicant admitted the majority of the allegations, but he denied the two medical \ndebts on the basis that he did not recognize them. He attributes the delinquent debts to \na period of unemployment, from March to December 2017.

He claims that he began addressing his debts shortly \nafter he regained employment in December 2017 and now, three years later he has \nresolved all but his child support arrearage. (Item 3) He is a poor historian of his financial \nhistory due to several inconsistencies in his answer to the SOR and his response to \nFORM. \nAs to the issue of unemployment, he disputes the information written in the FORM \nthat he voluntarily left his job in March 2017. (Item 4, AE V)) Applicant\u2019s response to the \nform stated that he inaccurately listed his reason for leaving his employment in his August \n15, 2018, SF86. He now states that he was an employee from 2013 until February 2017, \nnot a contractor. He states that the understanding was for him to work from home and \nvisit work sites in various states for four days a week. He stated that when the contract \nended, this arrangement was no longer possible. He did not want to move from his home \nstate. So, he declined the position and offered he was terminated. He declared there was \nno severance package. (Response to FORM, (AE V) \nHowever, he was not without any income and financial resources. He disclosed \nthat he started his own company and had real estate interests as early as 2013. At the \ntime, he owned sixteen properties. Applicant stated that he had some losses and in \nJanuary 2017, he invested $100,000 in an apartment complex. He stated that there was \ntheft of property by the management company, but provided no proof. He admits that \ninitially he focused on paying the mortgages and other expenses on his rental properties. \nApplicant also had consistent work as a contract employee. He has been employed on a \nfull-time basis since December 2017. He took trips abroad for tourism from 2011-2017. \n(Item 4) \nIn his answer to the FORM, Applicant stated that he began paying delinquent debts \nas early as January 2019 with a $37,581 payment to have his mortgage reinstated and a \npayment of $1,236 in April 2019, to pay another account. He did not address his child \nsupport arrears. (AE V) \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, an account that is past-due for child support arrears in \nthe approximate amount of $43,235, Applicant admitted the allegation, but claimed that \nhe was unable to provide child support from September 2017 to April 2019 due to financial \nlosses and insufficient income. He provided proof that he paid from February 2006, \nusually in the amount of $1,000, until September 24, 2019. However, some of the \namounts were much less. (AE A) The child custody issue is contentious. (Item 9) \nApplicant provided various court orders, including a temporary one, granting him custody \nin 2019 and allowing him to stop child support. (AE B, C) In 2017, after he was \nunemployed, he was ordered by a court to resume child- support payments and pay \n$12,000 in child support arrears for a seven-month period (October 2016 to April 2017. \nHe stated that he was unable to continue paying the arrearages due to insufficient income. \nThe mother of the child was ordered to pay some support but Applicant claims she has \nnot.

He projects that he will pay $700 a month and the arrearage will be reduced to \n$32,000. Applicant at one point stated that his attorney advised him to stop child support \npayments. He submitted a draft, unsigned order. (AE E). The support arrearage at this \ntime is unresolved. (Item 3) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b the SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted for a charged-off credit \ncard in the approximate amount of $22,155. The card was charged off in June 2019. (Item \n6, 7) Applicant contacted the collection agency on or about October 27, 2020, and \narranged to settle the debt for $10,000, which was paid on November 2, 2020. (AE F) In \nhis answer to the SOR, he presented a power of attorney document limited to credit \ncounseling. However, there is nothing in the record to show that he received financial \ncounseling. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.c, the SOR alleged that Applicant was indebted for a collection \naccount in the approximate account of $11,515. The debt was for a 2017 car loan. (Item \n6) He stated that the new car had constant repairs since he purchased it and it required \nmore in April 2018. (AE G) After negotiation, he voluntarily surrendered the car and it was \nsold at auction. There was a deficiency balance of $11,515. Applicant settled the debt in \nNovember 2020 for an unknown amount. (AE H) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.d, the SOR alleged that Applicant had an account placed in \ncollection in 2018 in the approximate amount of $9,657. He explained it was a credit card \nused for real estate repairs. He could not pay after his unemployment. A default judgment \nwas obtained against him in 2020 for $9,657. (Item 10) He settled the debt for an unknown \namount in September 2020. (Item 3, AE I) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.e, the SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to a creditor identified \nas a medical account on his credit report, date April 7, 2020, Applicant denied this debt \nbecause he was not familiar with or liable for the account. He engaged a financial services \nfirm and was advised to contact the creditor to validate the debt. He claims he called the \ncreditor and the debt was not validated. It was removed from his credit report. He has no \ndocumentation for this claim. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.f, the SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to a charged-off \naccount in the amount of $5,449, which was a credit card used for real estate repairs \nwhich became delinquent in 2018 and was charged off in March 2019. (Item 8) Applicant \ncontacted the agency in October 2020 and settled the debt for $2,179.98. It was paid on \nNovember 3, 2020. (Item 3, AEJ) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant was indebted to a creditor identified as a medical \naccount, dated April 2020, in the approximate amount of $109. Applicant denied this \nallegation. He claims that there was one credit report that had the account listed, but no \nidentifying information for the original creditor. He has been unable to discover any other \ninformation about this alleged debt.

Applicant admitted and denied this \nallegation. He failed to file his 2017 federal tax return because of complicated business \nlosses, his poor bookkeeping and negligence to file. It was filed in February 2020. (Item \n3) The filing occurred long after his security clearance process began. It also appears that \nApplicant carries an outstanding Federal tax balance for prior years. (Item 3) \nApplicant explained that normally his CPA completes his tax return, but in 2017, \nApplicant decided to do the bookkeeping. He noted that he did a poor job. His CPA \nneeded an extension to file the 2017 federal income tax return because Applicant failed \nto provide the CPA with the required forms and documentation. The tax return was filed \nin February 2020. (Item 3, AE K) Ultimately, he claimed he was owed a refund. \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement on December 18, 2020. He \nreports a net monthly income of $22,146 and other income from his realty company of \n$6,822. (AE O) His monthly expenses are $7,650. His debts include the child support \narrears with his actual monthly amount listed as zero. He is paying other mortgages. His \nmonthly net remainder is $10,899. Applicant lists his total assets as $2,190,000. \nApplicant presented letters of recommendation from college friends, colleagues, \nand a member of a board of trustees for child protection. Some of the references have \nknown Applicant for more than 20 years. Each letter attests to his diligence, ethics, \nintegrity, and diligence in his professional and personal life. (AE P-U) \nApplicant settled the SOR debts, with the exception of the child-support arrears, in \n2020, after the SOR was issued. The delinquent accounts were from 2018 and 2019. He \nchanged some of his responses after the FORM was issued in February 2021. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19 (f) (failure to file or \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG\u00b6 20 (f): failure to file or fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay . . . . . . \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in 2017 when a contract ended and he was \nunemployed for nine months. He initially stated in his SF-86 that he received a severance \npackage, but denied that in his response to the FORM. He presented inconsistent \nanswers as to the ending of his job in 2017. This casts doubts on his trustworthiness and \nwhether he acted responsibly in addressing his delinquent debts. The other issue is one \nof not filing a federal tax returns for 2017 and not providing his CPA the necessary \ndocuments to file. AG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not established. Applicant\u2019s child-support \narrearages remain unresolved and he is relying on a court order that has not yet been \nsigned. He chose to pay other delinquent accounts or settle others. He also stated that \nhis attorney advised him not to pay despite a court order. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not provide proof that he \nreceived financial counseling. The record does not support good-faith efforts to repay \ncreditors. He waited and decided to settle. This is a legitimate way to pay, but he waited \nuntil after the security clearance process began to begin resolving his delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis child support is unresolved even though Applicant can clearly afford to pay the \narrearages. \nAG \u00b6 20(f). Applicant admitted that he failed to file his 2017 federal income tax \nreturn in a timely manner.

As of the close of the record, he owed child-support \narrearages of over $44,000 and was not making payments towards the arrears. For these \nreasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through h. against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, I conclude that Applicant has not carried his \nburden. He has held a security clearance since 2008 and presented excellent references \nHe has not addressed his child support arrearages.This creates great doubt on his \njudgment as he had a court order confirming his arrearages. Accordingly, Applicant has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

He received an associate\u2019s \ndegree in information technology in 2016. Since April 2021, he has worked for an \nautomobile manufacturing company in production. This is his first security clearance \napplication, and his employment with a defense contractor as a computer technician is \ndependent upon him obtaining a security clearance. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 11-13) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 13 delinquent student loans, totaling $50,783. \nIn his response to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations. The debts alleged in the \nSOR were confirmed by Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR) dated April 2019. \n(Answer; GE 2) \nApplicant attributed his inability to make payments toward his student loan \nobligations to various periods of unemployment and insufficient income.

During this period, he did \nnot receive unemployment or his regular pay. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 14, 34; AE C to AE F) \nApplicant incurred student loans between approximately 2008 and 2016. He \nattended school between 2008 and 2011, returned to school in 2013, and graduated in \n2016. The notices for his loans initially were sent to his mother\u2019s house as she co-signed \nfor his loans. At that time, he was not living with her, and it took her a couple of months \nto notify him of his mail; however, he did eventually contact his student loan creditors. He \nwas told that his monthly student loan payments would be approximately $500, which he \ncould not afford. According to Applicant, he did make a few payments toward some of the \nsmaller loans approximately 10 years ago. However, he could not recall how many \npayments he made, how much he paid toward the loans, and he failed to provide proof \nof any payments. (GE 1 at 10-11; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 21-23, 30) \nIn his November 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had delinquent student\nloans, but he \u201ccould not locate the necessary details on exactly how much [he] owe[d]\nand which providers [he] owe[d] which amounts. (GE 1 at 43). \n \n \nDuring his December 2019 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \nindicated he had lost track of his student loan obligations, but he would make an effort to \nmake payments toward his student loans once he had saved enough money. At the \nhearing, he testified that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he was unable to make any \npayments.

(Tr. 20, 32) \nAccording to Applicant, his student loans qualify for deferment under the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to support this claim at the hearing or after the hearing. (Tr. 24, 31-32, 37) \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was earning $18.95 an hour, which was $3 to \n$4 more than he had ever earned from a previous employer. With overtime, his net \nmonthly income is typically $3,000. The month before the hearing, he had a surplus of \n$1,000, after he paid his bills. Additionally, in February 2021, Applicant hired a financial \ncoach to help him manage his spending, eliminate bad financial habits, and create a \nbudget. He did not provide a copy of his budget or details related to the financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 24-29) \nApplicant does not currently have any money in savings. He provided copies of his \ntax filings for tax years 2017 through 2020, and his annual federal adjusted gross income \nranged between $23,020 and $31,233. He also provided statements for his car insurance \nand car loan, demonstrating these accounts were current and in good standing. (Tr. 30; \nAE A - F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s various periods of unemployment and low income have negatively \naffected his ability to make payments toward his delinquent student loans, which total \nover $50,000; however, he failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to address his \nstudent loans in response to his financial setbacks. Six months ago, he started receiving \nfinancial counseling; however, he failed to provide evidence of a written budget, nor did \nhe demonstrate how the counseling service is helping him address or resolve his financial \nissues. He failed to provide evidence that he has made payments toward his student \nloans, nor has made a good-faith effort to resolve or enter a rehabilitation agreement. Nor \nhas Applicant provided evidence that the CARES Act applies to his student loans. Even \nif he had provided documentation that his student loans are currently deferred by the \nCARES Act, his failure to act responsibly toward his student loans since at least 2016 \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/21/2021 \nDecision \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence, but he mitigated the concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nOn September 18, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines B and F. \nDOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 28, 2020, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 21, 2021, and the hearing was convened \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas scheduled on July 13, 2021, using the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) video \nteleconferencing capabilities. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as a hearing exhibit (HE I). Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A1 \u2013 \nA11, B1 \u2013 B14, and C1 \u2013 C5. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence, which he did in the form of AE A12 \u2013 A15. All were admitted \nwithout objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 22, 2021. \nProcedural Ruling \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to Egypt. Applicant did not object and the request was granted. The request \nwas not admitted into evidence but was included in the record as HE II. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He was born in Egypt in 1973. He lived in Egypt for \napproximately 30 years before immigrating to the United States in 2005 through the \nuse of a spousal visa. He married his first wife (W1) in 2000, and he has three children \nfrom this marriage. His son is (S) 19, his oldest daughter (D1) is 17, and his youngest \ndaughter (D2) is 16. He divorced W1 in September 2003 and married his second wife \n(W2) in October 2003. W2 is a native-born U.S. citizen. Applicant and W2 were married \nin Egypt and lived there for two years until they moved to the United States in 2005. \nW2 sponsored Applicant for his spousal visa to become a resident alien in 2005. He \nattained U.S. citizenship in 2008. He divorced W2 in 2013. He remarried W1 in 2016. \nW1 currently resides in Egypt with D1 and D2. S is currently attending college in the \nUnited States. Applicant graduated from high school in Egypt, but also successfully \ncompleted the general educational development (GED) test in 2013. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in engineering in May 2018. He has worked for a defense contractor \nsince June 2019. (Tr. 36-37, 39, 58-61; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that W1, Applicant\u2019s father (F), brother (B), \nand two sisters (S1 and S2) are all citizens and residents of Egypt; that S is a citizen of \nEgypt residing in the United States; that D1 and D2 are dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens \nresiding in Egypt; that Applicant provides $500 monthly to his children living in Egypt; \nand that he owns property in Egypt where W1, D1, and D2 reside. Under Guideline F, \nSOR alleged that Applicant had nine delinquent collection and charged-off debts \ntotaling approximately $28,520. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.i) The debts are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and entries on credit reports. (GE 3-4; Answer to SOR) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign Relatives \nW1 (SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.h): As related above, Applicant remarried W1 in 2016. She \nis a native-born Egyptian who currently resides there. She holds an Egyptian passport, \nwhich expires in December 2027. She has never visited the United States. She has a \nlaw degree, but has never practiced law. She is a full-time mother. She lives in Egypt \nwith D1 and D2 in an apartment purchased by Applicant for approximately $20,000 in \n2013. Applicant provides the sole financial support for W1 and their daughters. He has \ndaily contact with W1 either by telephone or internet messaging. W1 has no affiliation \nwith the Egyptian government or military. She applied for U.S. resident-alien status in \nJune 2021. Applicant believes the application process could take as long as one year. \n(Tr. 36, 42-46, 48, 50, 97-98; AE B1, B12-B14) \nS (SOR 1.b): S is a native-born Egyptian citizen who acquired U.S. citizenship \nthrough Applicant\u2019s sponsorship in 2011, when S was still a minor. He currently holds \ndual citizenship from both countries. He resides in the United States, where he is \nattending college. S has no intention to return to Egypt after he completes college. He \nhas no affiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 47-48, 50; 69-70; AE \nB4-B7) \nD1 and D2 (SOR 1.c): D1 and D2 are native-born Egyptian citizens who \nacquired U.S. citizenship through Applicant\u2019s sponsorship in 2011, when they were still \nminors. They both currently reside in Egypt with their mother, W1 and are supported \nfinancially by Applicant. They attend an American school in Egypt to prepare them for \ncollege in the United States. Applicant is fearful for their safety in Egypt, not \nnecessarily from the government or terrorism, but because of the prevalent street crime \nthat exists there. He hired a driver to take them to and from school for safety reasons. \nD1 is now a senior in high school. Applicant intends for them to come to the United \nStates with W1 when her immigration application is approved, or he will bring them \nboth to the United States even if W1\u2019s application is not finalized. They both visited the \nUnited States this summer and stayed with Applicant for about two months. Applicant \nhas daily contact with D1 and D2 either by telephone or internet messaging. Neither D1 \nnor D2 have affiliations with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 43, 46-48, 50, 69-\n70, 72-75, 97-98; AE B8-B11) \nF (SOR 1.e): F is a native-born Egyptian who also resides there. He is 84 years \nold and is retired from the oil industry and living on a \u201cgood\u201d pension. Applicant does \nnot provide any financial support to F. According to Applicant, F is \u201cvery sick\u201d and lives \nwith B. Applicant has frequent contact with his father because of his health through \ntelephone calls or messages. After his mandatory military service in 1973, F had no \nfurther affiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 49-51, 75-76; GE 1) \nB (SOR 1.f): B is a native-born Egyptian who also resides there. He is 34 years \nold. He works for the same private sector oil company for whom F worked. Applicant \ndoes not provide any financial support for B. Since F lives with B, Applicant has \nfrequent contact with B acting as a conduit to communicate with F. Otherwise, \n3 \n\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s substantive contact with B is less than twice a month. B has no affiliation \nwith the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 50-51, 75-76; GE 1) \nS1 and S2 (SOR 1.g): S1 and S2 are native-born Egyptians who also reside \nthere. S1 is 52 years old and S2 is 41 years old. Neither work outside the home. \nApplicant does not provide any financial support to either of them. He has contact with \nhis sisters less frequently than with F or B, probably twice a year. S1 and S2 have no \naffiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 50-52, 78; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that he never voted in an Egyptian election the entire time he \nresided there. Upon gaining U.S. citizenship, he voted in the 2008 Presidential election, \nwhich was the last time he voted. He also stated that after he divorced W2 in 2010 he \nwent through some difficult times until he obtained his college degree in 2018. Those \ndifficult times contributed to his financial problems discussed below. To continue to \nsupport his family living in Egypt while he was in college, he worked low-paying jobs \nand lived in his car for several months. He is now in a much more stable financial \nposition, with an annual salary of approximately $190,000. This has allowed him to pay \nhis delinquent debts, purchase a home, and establish some savings. He believes once \nall of his children come to the United States, they will permanently reside here. He \nintends to sell his apartment in Egypt once his family comes to the United States. He \nlast visited Egypt from September 2018 to January 2019. He stayed with his family in \ntheir apartment. He returned to help tutor his son in preparation to take his college \nscholastic aptitude test (SAT). (Tr. 41, 49, 53, 63, 65, 67, 70, 79, 81) \nEgypt \nSeveral terrorist organizations operate in Egypt. In 2014, the most active \nterrorist group operating there pledged its allegiance to ISIS. The U.S. Department of \nState has assessed Cairo as a critical-threat location for terrorism directed at U.S. \nGovernment interests. It also has been given a Level 3 travel advisory. The Egyptian \nGovernment does not respect the full spectrum of human rights. \nFinancial \nApplicant recently resolved his remaining debts. He explained that he did not act \nsooner to resolve them because he did not obtain his current well-paying job until \n2019. He also did not understand the security significance or implications of having bad \ndebts until after he began seeking a security clearance. He recently purchased a home \nand his most recent credit report shows all his debts are current. (Tr. 82, 84; GE 5; AE \nC1 \u2013 C5) \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a-$5,435. Applicant settled this credit-card debt in June 2021 and \nprovided documentation corroborating the settlement. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 83; AE \nA13) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b-$4,478. Applicant received an IRS 1099-C, cancellation of debt form \nfor this debt for tax year 2020. He provided documentation corroborating the \ncancellation. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 86-87; AE A14) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c-$4,470. Applicant received an IRS 1099-C, cancellation of debt form \nfor this debt for tax year 2020. He provided documentation corroborating the \ncancellation. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 86-87; AE A15) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d-$8,943. Applicant settled this credit-card debt in June 2021 and \nprovided documentation corroborating the settlement. This debt is resolved. (AE A1, \nA10) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e-$6,038. Applicant received an IRS 1099-C, cancellation of debt form \nfor this debt for tax year 2018. He provided documentation corroborating the \ncancellation. This debt is resolved. (AE A3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f-$461. Applicant paid this credit-card debt in August 2021 and \nprovided documentation corroborating the payment. This debt is resolved. (AE A12) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g-$2,280. Applicant paid this credit-card debt in November 2020 and \nprovided documentation corroborating the payment. This debt is resolved. (AE A9) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h-$402. Applicant paid this credit-card debt in November 2020 and \nprovided documentation corroborating the payment. This debt is resolved. (AE A11) \nSOR \u00b6 2i-$237. Applicant paid this credit-card debt in November 2020 and \nprovided documentation corroborating the payment. This debt is resolved. (AE A7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated \nor induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s nuclear family, consisting of W1, D1, and D2 reside in Egypt as does \nhis extended family consisting of F, B, S1, and S2. Applicant\u2019s son is a dual U.S.\u00ad\nEgyptian citizen residing in the United States. Applicant also owns property in Egypt \nand provides the sole financial support for W1, D1, and D2. He last visited Egypt in \n2019, but he has nearly daily contact with his wife and daughters who live there. Egypt \nis a country with a significant terrorist presence and which has a poor human-rights \nrecord. Because of Egypt\u2019s posture in these areas, and Applicant\u2019s connection to his \nfamily, there exists a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) have been raised by the \nevidence. However, I find in favor of Applicant on SOR 1(d), alleging that Applicant \nprovided $500 monthly to his family living in Egypt, because those are facts and \ncircumstances concerning the family\u2019s presence in Egypt and do not raise separate \nsecurity concerns. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nBased upon the continued presence of W1, D1, and D2 in Egypt and their total \nreliance on Applicant\u2019s financial support, a situation exists where Applicant could be \nplaced in a position to choose between the interests of his relatives in Egypt and those \nof the United States. Although Applicant has lived in the United States since 2008, and \nhe has established substantial ties to this country, three members of his immediate \nfamily remain in Egypt. W1\u2019s application to become a resident alien was only submitted \nin June 2021 and will not be acted upon for at least a year. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration and any doubt must be resolved in \nfavor of national security. I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable. Despite the presence of some mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome the \nsignificant security concerns that exist. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having \nto engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAppellant had multiple delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. Both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAppellant incurred his debts when he was supporting his family living in Egypt \nand trying to complete college at the same time. While Applicant let the debts remain \nunaddressed for a significant period, due to his lack of financial resources and his non-\ncomprehension of the security significance of his delinquent debts, he eventually acted \nresponsibly by settling and paying several of the debts and claiming three cancelled \ndebts as income on his federal tax returns. While he should have acted in a timelier \nmanner to address his debts, they all have been paid or otherwise resolved. He has \nestablished a track record of steady payments, and his current financial picture \nappears to be healthy. Both of the above listed mitigating conditions substantially \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nassociates are vulnerable to government coercion. Applicant has not overcome the \nvulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress created by his relationship \nto relatives in Egypt. If W1, D1, and D2 eventually come to reside in the United States \nwith Applicant, then at that time, a review of his relationships with any Egyptian \nrelatives to determine any existing vulnerabilities may be appropriate, but that time is \nnot now. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s circumstances in immigrating to the United States \nand his accomplishments since coming here. On the other hand, I have also \nconsidered the continued risk that is posed by the presence of his family members in \nEgypt. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. He did \nmitigate the financial consideration concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph \n1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.i: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate personal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to \nhold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 14, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the personal conduct guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                                                  Procedural Issues \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and requested a hearing. The case \nwas assigned to me on February 21, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for April 23, 2021, \nand heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted \nof 12 exhibits. Applicant relied on two witnesses (including herself) and five exhibits. \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on May 12, 2021. \nBefore the close of the hearing, the Government amended the SOR to add an \nallegation covering domestic violence charges filed against Applicant in 2020 and \ndisputed by Applicant. Prior to the close of the hearing, the parties were afforded \nopportunities to supplement the record with written briefs covering appeal board \ndecisions addressing raised security concerns over incurred multiple traffic offenses. \nBoth parties submitted post-hearing briefs for consideration. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E., Applicant allegedly was charged on multiple occasions \nbetween July 2007 and May 2018 with traffic-related offenses. Allegedly, only two of the \ncharges resulted in convictions and sentencing. By pre-hearing amendment, the \nGovernment added an additional allegation of a charge of assault-second degree with \nthe charges still pending. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations under each \nof the cited SOR guidelines with explanations and clarifications. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 36-year-old software tester for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance.

One of the incidents was alcohol-related that resulted in her arrest in August \n2011 for driving under the influence (DUI). Arrest records confirm that she was charged \nwith DUI in August 2011 (GEs 1 and 4), pled guilty, was fined $250, and was sentenced \nto probation before judgment. (GE 4) Her probation conditions included suspension of \nher driving privileges for 30 days and avoidance of any repetitive behavior. (GE 4; Tr. \n95-96) Upon satisfaction of her probation conditions, the DUI charges were court-\ndismissed without judgment. (Tr. 96-97,159) Since her 2011 DUI, Applicant rarely \nconsumes alcohol and has never been charged with another DUI offense. (Tr. 97) \nRecords document that between July 2007 and January 2016, Applicant was \ncharged with driving on a suspended license on six separate occasions (2007, 2008, \n2012-2013, and 2015-2016. (GEs 1-2 and 4-8; Tr. 90-95) When she failed to appear on \nthese traffic-related arrests and charges, the presiding courts issued bench warrants \nand license suspensions. Most of the time, she did not appear for her scheduled court \nhearings due to memory lapses and her failures to open her mail, but on a few \noccasions, the warrant notices did not reach her at her new addresses. (Tr. 78-87, 177) \nApplicant never requested any of the presiding courts to place one or more of the \nindividual cases on the stet dockets. (Tr. 144-145)  \nWhile driving home in May 2018, Applicant was stopped and charged with \nknowingly driving an uninsured vehicle and driving a vehicle on a highway with a \nsuspended registration. (GEs 1 and 9; Tr. 97-99, 109, 159) For cited lack of monetary \nresources to cover her insurance billings, she avoided opening her mail and continued \nto drive her vehicle back and forth to work for over eight months before she was \nstopped and charged. (Tr. 101-102, 157,182) When she appeared in court to answer \nthe charges, she was released by the court without any jail time. (Tr. 94) Applicant has \nmore income now and promised to avoid driving in the future should she lack insurance \nand to faithfully attend scheduled hearings should she ever be issued a citation in the \nfuture. (Tr. 158) \nAppearing in court to answer the pending driving an uninsured vehicle on a \nsuspended registration, she pled guilty, was fined $2,400 (covered by a court-approved \npayment plan), and was sentenced to probation before judgment. (GEs 9 and 11; Tr. \n108) Probation conditions included insuring her vehicle, updating her registration, \nperforming community service, and completing her already-enrolled substance abuse \nprogram. (GE 11) Applicant is credited with satisfying her court-approved payment plan \nand successfully completing all of the requirements of her substance abuse program \nand other imposed probation conditions. (GEs 2 and 4 and AE G; Tr. 40, 108-109, and \n159) Pending charges were dismissed. (Tr. 159)  Since her last traffic-related offense, in \n2018, Applicant has never let her insurance lapse. (Tr. 109-110) \n \nBetween 2016 and February, Applicant and her ex-boyfriend cohabited. (GE 12; \nTr. 98-99, 114-115) While their financial living arrangements were based on cost-\nsharing, her boyfriend often failed to cover his share of the bills (including her car \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninsurance) that he promised to take care of. (Tr. 100-102,109-112) Without financial \nassistance from her boyfriend, Applicant turned to working night shifts on other jobs to \nmake more money. (Tr. 105) From the outset, their relationship included periodic heated \narguments (to include screaming and yelling) and generally abusive treatment of her by \nher boyfriend. (Tr. 111-114) To improve their relationship, they attended couples \ncounselling in 2019, albeit without any tangible success. (Tr.116, 151) Applicant \nstruggled with mood swings during this time frame. To address her emotional issues, \nApplicant briefly consulted a therapist during the same period to address her bi-polar \ncondition. (Tr. 151-152) \nBy February 2020, Applicant\u2019s co-habitation relationship with her ex-boyfriend \nhad deteriorated to the breaking point. Looking for emotional relief, she temporarily \nmoved home to her mother\u2019s place before finding her own apartment. (Tr. 34, 114-115) \nTo this point, Applicant had not encountered any domestic violence incidents with her \nboyfriend. Police reports did not uncover any unreported domestic violence incidents \ninvolving Applicant and her ex-boyfriend. GE 12; Tr. 129) \nIn October 2020, Applicant and her boyfriend attended a wedding reception for \nhis sister. (GE 12; Tr. 116-117) Because he had become intoxicated while she was \nsober, she drove him to her place to spend the evening. (GE 12, Tr. 117-126, 148) \nOnce they returned to her apartment, Applicant\u2019s boyfriend initially positioned himself on \nthe couch. (GE 12) After repairing to her bedroom at Applicant\u2019s request, he emerged \nfrom the bedroom to mount an argument with Applicant over her not joining him in the \nbed. (GE 12) Arguments ensued between the pair and quickly escalated into heated \nverbal exchanges before turning physical. (GE 12; Tr. 148-149) Applicant\u2019s \nacknowledged loud yelling prompted some unknown person to call the police. (Tr. 119) \nPolice accounts confirm arguments between Applicant and her boyfriend over \ntheir sleeping arrangements. (GE 12) The investigating officer recited pushing and \nshoving between the parties and Applicant\u2019s clawing her boyfriend\u2019s face after he struck \nher in the face. (GE 12) Photos were taken of both parties, and the investigating officer \nreported several lacerations on her boyfriend\u2019s face. (GE 12) \nAsked to provide a complete a portion of the domestic violence supplement \ndiagram, Applicant declined. (GE 12) While her boyfriend provided some details of his \n2020 encounter with Applicant, he, too, refused to provide a written statement. (GE 12) \nBased on the investigating officer\u2019s findings, police filed domestic violence charges \nagainst Applicant and closed the case. (GE 12). \nCourt records document criminal charges filed against Applicant in October 2020 \nfor assault-second degree (a misdemeanor). (GEs 1, 12 and AE D) The case was nolle \nprossed in March 2021 without any assigned reasons. Neither police arrest reports nor \ncourt records reveal any changed or supplemental accounts provided by Applicant \nconcerning the October 2020 domestic violence incident. (AE D; Tr. 161-163) Whether \nApplicant\u2019s boyfriend declined to support the charges going forward is unclear as well. \nSurprised initially of criminal charges being filed against her, Applicant first learned of \nthe police charges from her manager who she had contemporaneously disclosed the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSince the October 2020 incident, Applicant has taken concerted steps to address \nher emotional issues and to ensure she never misses court notices again. (Tr. 87, 135-\n136) She has a coach to help her with her decision-making and is looking for a \ncounselor to help her with her emotional-stress issues.

Additional security concerns arise \nout of charges of domestic violence filed against Applicant in October 2020 that were \nnolle prossed before they could be tested at trial. Considered together, these charges \nraise security concerns over whether Applicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern misbehavior \nincompatible with the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining \naccess to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s proven track record of traffic-related offenses consists of eight traffic-\nrelated offenses between 2007 and 2018 (inclusive of Applicant\u2019s 2011 DUI offense), \nsix driving on a suspended license offenses, and one driving without insurance in an \nunregistered vehicle in 2018. The eight combined traffic-related offenses and one DUI \nincident, while spaced, share a common thread of security concerns over questionable \nexercises in judgment. These collective errors in judgment, when stitched together \ncontextually, reflect an overall pattern of poor judgment, unreliability, and \nuntrustworthiness under the personal conduct guideline. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s lone DUI offense in 2011 would likely not meet the track \nrecord requirements for denying clearances under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), if \ncross-alleged separately under that guideline. Historically, the Appeal Board has \ngenerally required a track record of alcohol-related incidents of more recent occurrence \nthan the dated 2011 incident in this record. See ISCR Case No. 95-0731 at 3 (Sept. \n1996); ISCR Case No. 94-1081 at 5 (August 1995). Applicant\u2019s lone 2011 DUI incident \nhas not been cross-alleged under Guideline G, and for good reason. \nBased on the evidence produced at hearing, one of the DCs covered by the \npersonal conduct guideline is applicable to the developed facts in evidence. DC \u00b6 16(d), \n\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and \nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined \nwith all available information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information.

In ISCR Case No. 03-08475 at 5-8 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, \n2007), the applicant accumulated seven traffic-related offenses and one DUI offense. \nSimilar to the array of offenses cited in this case, the traffic-related offenses considered \nin ISCR Case No. 03-08475 were comprised of speeding, license plate offenses, \ndisobeying road sign, driving  with a suspended license, and a DUI. Like the traffic-\nrelated instances cited in ISCR Case No. 03-08475, most of the incidents individually \ncould be expected to fall into minor categories if assessed individually.  \n \n \nConsidered together in the context of a pattern display of lapses in judgment, \nApplicant\u2019s covered actions reflected, in the Appeal Board\u2019s judgment in ISCR Case No. \n03-08475, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. While Applicant is \ncorrect in her noting that the Appeal Board did not make any independent findings itself \non the security significance of multiple traffic-related offenses, its sustaining of the trial-\ncourt\u2019s decision reflects its concurrence with the trial court\u2019s findings that the applicant\u2019s \nmultiple traffic-related offenses when considered together with a DUI offense reflected \nthe applicant\u2019s reckless disregard for applicable rules and regulations.  \n \n \nOther Appeal Board cases cited by the Government involving multiple traffic-\nrelated offenses also sustained clearance denials for reasons of demonstrated lack of \noverall judgment sufficient to raise security concerns over applicant\u2019s cited inability to \nfollow rules and regulations over a prolonged period of years.

In the developed police findings covering the incident, Applicant \nminimized her boyfriend\u2019s initiating assaults and essentially accepted responsibility for \nher boyfriend\u2019s photographed injuries. \nBased on the developed accounts of the participants and their own observations \nin this 2020 incident, the investigating police officers placed criminal responsibility on \nApplicant for the incident and charged her with one misdemeanor account of domestic \nviolence. At no time before the date set for hearing in March 2021 did Applicant make \nany attempt to correct her account with either the investigating police or prosecutors. \nThe case was ultimately nolle prossed for unspecified reasons but without any advance \nassistance from Applicant in changing her account of the incident.

And, she has manifestly impressed her managers and colleagues with \nher professional contributions to her employer. Whether she retains any lingering \naffections for her ex-boyfriend are difficult to calculate. Less than a year has elapsed \nsince she ended her relationship with him.

In recognition of her improved understanding of the importance of adhering to \nstate driving rules and regulations designed to protect others using state highways and \nroadways, her recognition of her need to find counseling assistance to help her \novercome the stressors associated with her unstable relationship with her ex-boyfriend, \nand her evidenced maturity in her current employment practices and relationships, \nsome application of MC \u00b6\u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d and MC 17(g), \n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has ceased, or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations,\u201d are \navailable to Applicant. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her history of traffic-related incidents (inclusive of a prior DUI \nincident) and more recent domestic violence incident with her revised accounts of \nresponsibility and accountability over an extended period of time (spaced over 13 years) \nwhen taken together contextually reflect collective judgment lapses incompatible with \nher holding a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her civilian \ncontributions to the defense industry, her contributions are not enough at this time to \novercome her pattern history of traffic-related and more recent domestic violence-\nrelated incidents covered by the personal conduct guideline. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n   \n                             Against Applicant \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \n \n \nSummarized, more time is needed for Applicant to demonstrate her \nunderstanding and commitment to adhering to the rules and regulations placed in force \nby her state\u2019s traffic laws and civil laws covering domestic partners.

Accordingly, this case is \ndecided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 20, 2019. (Exhibit 5) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. She provided additional information when interviewed during a \nbackground investigation in 2019. (Exhibit 8) Thereafter, on January 11, 2021, after \nreviewing the available information, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons \n(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR is similar to a complaint.

Her answers were mixed \nwith admissions and denials; she provided explanatory remarks; and she provided \nsupporting documentation. She also requested a decision based on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. In total, her answer consists of 21 pages. \nOn March 19, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant on March 25, 2021; she received it on April 7, 2021. She timely \nreplied to the FORM with a three-page memorandum and four documents, which are \nadmitted as Exhibits A, B, C, D, and E. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 15, 2021. After initial review of Applicant\u2019s \nreply to the FORM, and in an abundance of caution, I contacted Applicant by telephone \non June 21, 2021. The purpose of the call was to ask if she had any additional \ndocumentation she desired to present in her case. Applicant said she did not. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for her job with a federal contractor. (Exhibit 5) She has a full-time \njob as a production and planning scheduler for a shipbuilding company. She has been \nso employed since February 2019. Before that, she had a part-time job as a server and \nbartender from August 2013 to February 2019. Before that, she had a full-time job as a \ncustomer-service representative from July 2013 to October 2013. And before that, she \nhas a full-time job as a marketing crew member from January 2013 to July 2013. She \nalso had a part-time job as a bartender during 2009-2013 when she was a college \nstudent. \nApplicant has not held a security clearance in the past. (Exhibit 5 at Section 25) \nShe has never married, and she has one child under the age of five. After high school, \nshe attended a small, private college during 2006-2008. She withdrew after deciding to \npursue a course of study not available at the private college. She then attended a large \nstate university for the next several years during 2009-2013. She was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2013. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of 17 delinquent debts \nin amounts ranging from $79 to $32,271 for a total of more than $130,000. Thirteen of \nthe 17 delinquent debts are student loans placed in collection. She did not disclose \ndelinquent debts or other financial issues in her June 2019 security clearance \napplication. (Exhibit 5 at Section 26) Likewise, during her 2019 background \ninvestigation, she did not disclose delinquent debts or other financial issues until she \nwas confronted during the interview process.

(Exhibit 8 at 2-3) In her answer to the SOR, she \nadmitted 14 of the delinquent debts. \nThe current status of the various accounts in the SOR is discussed below. In \nsummary, Applicant has successfully resolved a retail collection account, three medical \ncollection accounts, and two student loans. Ten student loans in collection are in the \nbeginning stages of resolution. The 11th  student loan in collection is wholly unresolved.   \n \nThe $274 past-due account with a balance of $2,870 in SOR \u00b6 1.a stems from a \nretail account. Applicant explained in her answer to the SOR that her mother opened \nthe account in Applicant\u2019s name and she was unaware of it. In reply to the FORM, \nApplicant provided documentation that her mother assumed liability for the account with \nthe creditor and the account is being resolved via a collection lawsuit. (Exhibit B) I find \nthis account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe three medical collection accounts for $117, $79, and $154 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, and 1.e were unknown to Applicant until she learned about them during the security \nclearance process. She paid these debts in February 2021. (Answer at 7, 10) I find \nthese accounts are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe remaining 13 delinquent accounts in the SOR are for student loans. First, in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, is a $1,868 student loan in collection with a state educational assistance \nactivity. Applicant\u2019s February 2021 credit report shows this account as a paid collection. \n(Answer at 8) I find this account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSecond, in SOR \u00b6 1.j, is a $3,805 student loan in collection with a state \neducational assistance activity. Applicant denied this debt in her Answer to the SOR. \nDepartment Counsel, in their brief in support of the FORM, conceded that the account \nappears to overlap with the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f and is therefore not a valid separate \nallegation. I find this account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor due to duplication. \nThird, in SOR \u00b6 1.b, is a $6,766 student loan in collection stemming from her \nattendance at the small, private college during 2006-2008. She disputes the debt as \nexplained in her answer to the SOR. The debt is listed in an August 2019 credit report \nbut not in a more recent March 2021 credit report. (Exhibits 7 and 6, respectively). \nApplicant provided a February 2019 letter from a collection agency seeking to collect a \nbalance due of $6,616 from her. (Answer at 17) She has not provided additional \ndocumentation to substantiate her dispute. I find this account is unresolved. \nFourth, in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, are three student loans in collection with a \nstate educational assistance activity in amounts of $32,271, $22,630, and $13,209, \nrespectively, for a total of about $68,110. So far as I can determine, these three \naccounts are now in collection with the state attorney general\u2019s office. \nA May 4, 2021 letter from that office indicates the loans are in default and are \nbeing pursued through a collection lawsuit. (Exhibit C) Applicant requested a repayment \nagreement, and was requested to complete certain paperwork for that process, which \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \nthe state would then review to determine if it is reasonable. Then, once the state obtains \nservice upon Applicant and her sureties, the state would file a motion to set the case for \nhearing where the state would obtain a judgment against Applicant and her sureties, but \nwould agree to not proceed to enforce the judgment so long as she complied with the \nrepayment agreement. I find these loans are partially resolved. \nFifth, in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \u2013 1.q, are seven student loans in collection with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. The seven federal student loans total about $53,437. With her \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation, dated December 2, 2020, \nshowing that she started the process of rehabilitating the loans with a total balance of \nabout $63,117, which included substantial collection fees. (Answer at 11-16) \nIn her reply to the FORM, Applicant provided current information about the status \nof the loans. A February 11, 2021 letter from the Education Department states that the \nloans were transferred to them for servicing since Applicant successfully completed a \nloan-rehabilitation program. (Exhibit E) The total balance then due was about $53,565 \nfor the principal balance and outstanding interest. Applicant was further directed to \ndetermine an appropriate repayment option for her. \nThe next day, in a February 12, 2021 letter, the Education Department advised \nApplicant that her federal student loans were eligible for COVID-19 emergency relief \nmeasures. (Exhibit D) As a result, the seven federal student loans serviced by the \nEducation Department were granted a 0% interest rate for the period March 13, 2020, at \nleast through September 30, 2021, and the loans were placed in a payment suspension \nfor the same period. I find these loans are partially resolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2 484 U.S. at 531 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4   \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

I have reviewed all of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F \nand conclude none are fully applicable. With that said, Applicant has resolved 6 of the \n17 delinquent debts in the SOR, although three of the six debts are minor medical \ncollection accounts. I find for Applicant on the six accounts. \nApplicant has only partially resolved 10 of the remaining 11 student loans, all of \nwhich she defaulted. She now owes more than $100,000 in total between the state \neducational assistance activity and the Education Department. She also has more than \n$6,000 in collection for a student loan from her attendance at the small, private college, \nand that debt is wholly unresolved. It is also worth noting that the delinquent debts in the \nSOR had laid dormant and unaddressed until brought to Applicant\u2019s attention during the \nsecurity clearance process. One wonders if she would have taken any remedial action \non the indebtedness but for the scrutiny of the security clearance process. \nFor the three state loans, the collection lawsuit is pending, and Applicant is yet to \nbegin a repayment plan. For the seven federal loans, Applicant successfully completed \na loan-rehabilitation program and the loans are now in a type of forbearance for the next \nseveral months. But she will be required to begin a repayment plan in the near future. \nCompared with the length of time the student loans were in default (a period of years), it \nis simply too soon to tell if she will adhere to the repayment plans for the state and \nfederal student loans. \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she \nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c -- e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f -- 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i -- 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k -- 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

He received the FORM on February 15, 2021, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on May 17, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a. His admission is incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a university performing research as a \nfederal contractor.

He has no children. \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2016 SCA, he disclosed that in August 2012, he was stopped for \nspeeding and had marijuana and paraphernalia in his car. He was not intoxicated and \nwas not arrested. He was given a ticket for speeding. He paid the fine for speeding. When \nhe appeared in court on the drug charges, he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, \npursuant to a plea agreement. He paid $2,000 in fines and court fees and was placed on \nunsupervised probation for one year. He completed his probation without incident and his \ncriminal record was expunged in March 2014.

(FORM Item 6 at 5.) In his answer \nto the SOR, he denied SOR \u00b6 1.b, alleging use of marijuana while granted access to \nclassified information, asserting that he was not assigned to any classified programs and \nhas not had access to any classified information. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

He denied SOR \u00b6 1.b, asserting that he was not assigned to any \nclassified programs and that his purchase and use of marijuana was legal under local \nlaws. His claim that he has never had actual access to classified information misses the \npoint. A security clearance constitutes eligibility for access to classified information; it \ndoes not mean actual access. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s assertion that his marijuana purchase and use was legal in \nthe jurisdiction where he purchased and used it, DOHA proceedings are not a proper \nforum to debate the pros and cons of whether marijuana should be legal for some \npurposes, how it should be classified as a controlled substance, or the merits of DOD \npolicy concerning drug abuse. ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). \nFurthermore, in October 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI), wrote: \u201cAn \nindividual's disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of \nmarijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d He also \npointed out that laws of a state or the District of Columbia legalizing use of marijuana \u201cdo \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines.\u201d DNI memorandum, \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (Oct. 25, 2014). See ISCR Case \nNo. 16-00258 at n. 1 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2018) (\u201cIt merits noting, however, that while \nseveral states have decriminalized marijuana or allowed its use for medical or recreational \npurposes, such use of marijuana remains subject to the applicable disqualifying \nconditions in the Directive.\u201d) Thus, I conclude that SOR \u00b6 1.b is established. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, asserting that the charges of drug and paraphernalia \nwere dismissed.

The fact that the charges were not prosecuted does not refute \nthe fact that he was charged. I conclude that SOR \u00b6 1.c is established. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAppendix B to the Adjudicative Guidelines prohibits granting or renewing a security \nclearance to \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d There is no evidence that \nApplicant used marijuana after September 2018. Thus, he is not currently an \u201cunlawful \nuser,\u201d and Appendix B is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a):\n \n any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was recent \nand did not occur under unusual circumstances. It is arguably infrequent, because it was \nhis first and only marijuana use after he received a security clearance. However, he \ncontinues to associate with marijuana users, has not changed his environment, and has \nnot provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use. \n \nApplicant acknowledged in his two SCAs and during his security interviews that \nhis marijuana use was inconsistent with federal employment and that he was subject to \nperiodic drug testing. The gravamen of the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 25(f) is a breach \nof trust. \u201cA person who broke a promise to abide by drug laws after being placed on notice \nthat drug use is not compatible with access to classified information has not demonstrated \nthe quantum of reliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nParagraph 2 of the SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in Paragraph 1. The \nsecurity concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nDepartment Counsel argues that the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nrelevant: \n[C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n \nThe Appeal Board has recognized that language in Guideline E \u201ccontinues the \nlongstanding tenet that specific behavior can have security significance under more than \none guideline and . . . by focusing on the concepts of questionable judgment and \nirresponsibility, it contemplates that behavior will have independent security significance \nunder Guideline E in a broad range of cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-20964, (App. Bd. Apr. \n10, 2008).  \nI am not persuaded that AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ndoes not involve \u201cseveral adjudicative areas,\u201d nor is it \u201cinsufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline.\u201d Applicant\u2019s conduct falls squarely under \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \na single adjudicative guideline, and repeating it under Guideline E amounts to \nunnecessary \u201cpiling on\u201d with a redundant allegation. I have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.a for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I have considered his candor in disclosing his marijuana use in his two \nSCAs. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drugs): \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct); FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Based upon a review of the pleadings, the \ndocumentary evidence, and the testimony, national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 23, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking a security clearance.

DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 10, 2021, scheduling the hearing on April 7, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled.

In his Answer, he admitted all of the \nSOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nBackground \nApplicant is 31 and has never married. He lives with his girlfriend. He has one \ndaughter, age 6, who lives with her mother. He earned a high school diploma in May \n2008, and in 2010-2011 he took a few college courses. Since March 2018, he has worked \nfor a DoD contractor as an aircraft mechanic. His employer has sponsored him for his first \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. at 7, 15-16.) \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nWhen Applicant was 18 years old, he was making bad choices in his life. In 2008, \nhe had no money and decided to steal items he wanted. He was caught and charged with \nPetty Theft. He was fined and ordered to perform community service. He was also \nsentenced to 36 months of probation. (Tr. at 17; GE 3 at 3.) \nApplicant began drinking alcohol in 2009 at age 19 after completing high school. \nWhen he drank, he would typically consume in excess of five to ten cans of beer at a \ntime. In February 2009, he drank beer with some friends after work. One of the friends \ndrove a vehicle while intoxicated and Applicant was a passenger. The friend was pulled \nover and they were both arrested. Applicant was charged with Disorderly Conduct and \nDrunk in Public. As noted above, Applicant was on probation at the time. The state court \nrecords reflect that he was also charged with Failure to Appear after Written Promise and \nwas convicted of that charge as well as the charge of Drunk in Public. He was sentenced \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that after he turned 21, he started to drink in bars and would \nconsume alcohol more maturely. On average, he drank alcohol once a week. In February \n2015, he was celebrating his 25th  birthday at a nearby bar. For convenience reasons, he \ndrove to the bar rather than walk. A police officer stopped Applicant on his return from the \nbar and arrested him. He was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Driving \nUnder the Influence Alcohol/0.08% or more (DUI/0.08%). He was convicted on the \nsecond charge and again placed on summary probation for 36 months, which was \nscheduled to expire in August 2018. He was also fined $1,888. The court ordered \nApplicant to enroll in an alcohol group counseling program and to perform community \nservice. He was also given credit for having served two days in jail. (Tr. at 19-22; GE 3 at \n4; GE 5 at 1-3.) \n \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant was again arrested after a night of drinking at a bar \ncelebrating the Christmas holidays with co-workers. He was charged with DUI and \nDUI/0.08%. He plead nolo contendere to the second charge. His was still on probation at \nthe time. On June 14, 2017, the court sentenced Applicant to a mandatory term of 60 \nmonths of probation, which will expire in June 2022. He was also sentenced to 96 hours \nin jail and fined $390. He actually served 24 hours in jail. The court ordered Applicant to \nperform three months of community service and to participate in an 18-month alcohol \ntreatment or counseling program. He completed a group counseling program in April \n2019. The counseling was similar to the counseling he received in the 2015 program he \nattended, except that it was longer and he was required to attend a minimum number of \nsessions of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He attended the minimum AA sessions required \nto complete the program. Applicant did not receive a diagnosis regarding his use of \nalcohol.

(Tr. \nat 17-20; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 1-2.) \nAfter his most recent arrest, Applicant made changes in his life. He testified that \nhe has learned and grown from his alcohol-related arrests. Whenever he knows he will \nbe drinking alcohol, he develops a plan to avoid driving after drinking. He testified that he \nnever drives after one sip of alcohol. He understands that another arrest for driving after \ndrinking while on probation will likely result in an even more serious jail sentence than his \npast sentences. He only drinks a couple of times a month on average. When he does \ndrink, he typically drinks two to three beers, sometimes one beer and sometimes five \nbeers at a time. He testified that he drinks responsibly, though he admitted that he still \nwill drink to the point of intoxication. He said further that he does not have any difficulty \ncontrolling the amount of alcohol he consumes. He does not consider himself to be an \nalcoholic, nor does he believe he has a problem of any nature with alcohol. He has also \nmatured since he obtained his employment with his current employer and recognizes that \nimportance of that job to his future. He testified that he has received excellent job \nperformance evaluations and that he will never do anything that would jeopardize his job \nand career. Applicant\u2019s father is aware of his alcohol-related arrests, but Applicant \nprovided no testimony or documentary evidence that he has shared this personal history \nwith anyone else.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Two conditions potentially apply to the \nfacts found in this case: \n(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe record establishes both of the above potentially disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant has been arrested and convicted three times since 2009 for alcohol-related \nincidents. The evidence also established that for many years he drank alcohol \nexcessively. Accordingly, further review is required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. Three of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest \noccurred over four years ago. While that is a significant period of time, Applicant has been \non probation throughout that period and his probation will continue until June 2022. He is \nwell aware that any repetition of his past behavior of driving while under the influence of \nalcohol will likely result in a significant period of incarceration. Under these circumstances, \nit cannot be concluded that his behavior is unlikely to recur. Also, Applicant\u2019s history of \nalcohol-related arrests casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his pattern of \nmaladaptive alcohol use and has provided testimony about the actions he has taken to \navoid a future arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. He has also testified that \nhe has modified his consumption of alcohol. He has not, however, provided any evidence \nfrom third parties who know him to support his testimony. Also, he provided sparse \ntestimony and no documentary evidence regarding the nature of his counseling. He has \nnot received any treatment for his excessive drinking and has provided no evidence that \nhe received any treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is not established. As noted, Applicant provided no evidence that he \nhas sought or received any treatment for his alcohol consumption. He testified that he \ndoes not believe that he has any problems with alcohol. Therefore, he has made the \njudgment that he does not believe he requires any treatment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG & 31 contains five potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns under this guideline. Three of the conditions potentially \napply to the facts found in this case: \n(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe record evidence establishes all of the above disqualifying conditions. His \narrests and convictions present a pattern of offenses, any one of which would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision. In combination, the offenses cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant is currently on probation \nand will be on probation for more than one more year. Accordingly, further review is \nrequired. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. Two of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is only partially established. Over four years have passed since \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal offense. For the reasons stated above, this fact alone does not \nsupport a conclusion that future criminal behavior is unlikely. He has been on probation \nsince 2017, and that term of probation will continue until June 2022. The fact that his 2016 \narrest occurred while he was on probation for his 2015 DUI/0.08% conviction undercuts \nApplicant\u2019s mitigation evidence. The evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion that \nafter his probation has expired, Applicant will not again drive after drinking when it is \nconvenient for him to do so. The evidence taken as a whole supports a conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s past criminal conduct casts doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is only partially established. Applicant has shown his rehabilitation by \nperforming his important job as an aircraft mechanic since 2018. He has not supported \nthat evidence, however, with favorable statements from his supervisors or with \nperformance evaluations. Also, the mitigating value of the passage of time since \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal behavior is undercut by his ongoing term of probation, as noted \nabove. Lastly, he has not provided other evidence of rehabilitation, such as higher \neducation since 2016 or constructive community involvement, other than any community \nservice ordered by a court. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline at AG & 16 contains seven potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns under this guideline. Two of the conditions potentially apply \nto the facts found in this case: \n(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \nIn SOR \u00b6 3 the Government cross-alleged the Guideline G alcohol-related facts \nunder Guideline E of SOR \u00b6 1. The record evidence that established Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption as a disqualifying security concern is sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder Guideline G. Accordingly, the potentially disqualifying condition set forth in AG & \n16(c) is not applicable. \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) (1) is established. Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and his \narrests and convictions for DUI/0.08% evidences a pattern of irresponsible behavior that \nhas could affect his standing in his family and his community and could negatively impact \nhim professionally. This creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by \nothers. Applicant offered no testimony or documentary evidence in the form of reference \nletters or otherwise that would show that his history of abuse of alcohol and related \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncriminal charges is widely known, other than by his father, which would reduce his risk of \nexploitation. Further review is required. \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct. Two of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s offenses are not minor. Driving under \nthe influence of alcohol is a serious offense and can result in death, bodily injuries, and \nproperty damage. It cannot be concluded that his misconduct is unlikely to recur. His \nhistory of misconduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his past \nmisconduct and has taken steps to reduce its recurrence. He has not provided evidence, \nhowever, that he has taken positive steps to make his personal history widely known \nwithin his family, community, and place of employment to eliminate the risk of exploitation. \nWith respect to his alcohol consumption, he has never voluntarily taken positive steps to \nseek ongoing counseling to ensure that his past misconduct after drinking alcohol is not \nrepeated. As noted, his alcohol counseling was ordered by a court. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record \nevidence as described above leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline G, J, and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to satisfy his burden to \nmitigate security concerns involving alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the entire record, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is denied. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for this employer since November 2017. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2012. He has three children from this marriage, ages 24, 20, and 14.

The criminal conduct was also multiplicitously pleaded in SOR \u00b6 3.c. The allegations are supported by a September 2019 federal arrest report, statements to a defense investigator during his background investigation in October 2019, admissions he made in his answers to interrogatories in May 2020, and his December 2020 SOR answer.

He has worked for \nthis employer since November 2017. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1996 \nand divorced in 2012. He has three children from this marriage, ages 24, 20, and 14. \n(Tr. at 5, 20, 26-27; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guidelines J and G, that Applicant was involved in four \nalcohol-related arrests between 2002 and 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 2.a). The SOR also \nalleged, under Guideline E, that he falsified his August 2019 Electronic Questionnaires \nfor Investigation Processing (e-QIP) when he failed to list his previous arrests as \nrequired by the questions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b). The criminal conduct was also \nmultiplicitously pleaded in SOR \u00b6 3.c. The allegations are supported by a September \n2019 federal arrest report, statements to a defense investigator during his background \ninvestigation in October 2019, admissions he made in his answers to interrogatories in \nMay 2020, and his December 2020 SOR answer. (GE 2-4; SOR Answer) \nApplicant described his alcohol history as beginning when he was either 18 or 19 \nyears old. He increased his amount of consumption in approximately 1996 after he \nmarried. When he was approximately 26 years old he abstained from alcohol use for \nreligious reasons. This lasted until he was 30 years old. (Tr. at 27-29) \nThe four alcohol incidents are described below: \n2002 Driving Under the Influence (DUI) arrest. Applicant could not recall the \ndetails of this arrest. He admitted the conduct in his SOR answer. (Tr. at 33; GE 2-3; \nSOR answer) \n2011 Disorderly Conduct; Intoxication by Alcohol or Drugs; DUI arrest. \nApplicant could not recall the details of this arrest. He believed he received a ticket for \ndisorderly conduct. He denied the conduct in his SOR answer. A federal arrest report \ndescribes the arrest and it appears that only the disorderly conduct and intoxication \noffenses went to court.

Applicant described having several glasses of wine and bourbon \nwhiskey at a friend\u2019s house in June 2019. After he left the house, he was stopped by \nlaw enforcement for having tinted windows. During his October 2019 interview with a \ndefense investigator, he recalled taking a breathalyzer test, which showed a result of \n.08 percent blood alcohol. During his hearing testimony, he recalled that he declined the \nbreathalyzer test. He admitted committing this offense in his SOR answer. He was \nconvicted and, among other things, he was sentenced to four years\u2019 probation. He \nremains on probation. (Tr. 37-39; GE 2-4; SOR answer) \nApplicant offered a progress report from the court showing he had completed \napproximately 63 hours of education and counseling sessions as of October 2020. He \nalso provided a compliance form showing he had attended a victim-impact panel in \nAugust 2020, as required by his sentence. He has not participated in any alcohol \ntreatment programs and he also does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He \nclaims he has not consumed alcohol since his June 2019 arrest. He claims he uses \nmeditation to control any urge to consume alcohol. (Tr. at 56-47; SOR answer) \nApplicant listed his 2019 DUI arrest when he completed his SCA in August 2019. \nHe did not list the earlier alcohol-related offenses (2002, 2011, 2014). He testified that \nhe was under pressure to complete his e-QIP and did not recall the earlier incidents, \nwhich is why he failed to list them. (Tr. at 23, 26, 33, 44-45; SOR answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with four alcohol-related offenses between \n2002 and 2019. I find that the stated disqualifying condition applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s recent arrest for DUI in 2019 takes his series of arrests out of the \ncontext of remote. Since he still remains on probation, it is too soon to tell whether \nrehabilitation efforts have been successful. Neither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG \u00b6 32(d) apply.  \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the trustworthiness concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with four alcohol-related offenses between \n2002 and 2019. I find that the stated disqualifying condition applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s recent arrest for DUI in 2019 takes his series of arrests out of the \ncontext of remote. Since he still remains on probation, it is too soon to tell whether \nrehabilitation efforts have been successful. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct trustworthiness concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to list his 2002, 2011, and 2014 arrests was not done with the \nintent to deceive. Had that been the case, he would have also failed to list his 2019 \narrest. A faulty memory is more likely the cause of the omissions. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct was alleged under \nboth Guidelines J and G, therefore, also alleging it under guideline E makes such \nallegations multiplicious. AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 3.c. Guideline E \ndisqualifications were not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service and his compliance with his \nprobationary requirements to date. However, Applicant has had four alcohol incidents \nranging from 2002 to 2019. He remains on probation for the 2019 DUI conviction. At this \npoint, it is too soon to tell whether he will remain abstinent from alcohol in the future. His \ntrustworthiness and reliability have not been established. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption or criminal \nconduct trustworthiness concerns. Personal conduct concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph:   2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph:   3.a \u2013 3.c:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted (with comments and explanations) the financial allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c (owing one creditor for three accounts in collection for $22,226 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $3,941 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and $7,240 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). His SOR admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 36 years old. He graduated from high school in 2001, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He has never been married and has no children. This is his first security clearance application. 2 Applicant\u2019s work history in his 2019 SCA indicates he worked as a pizza delivery driver between June 2008 and November 2011. He then worked in different positions for a home inspection company between 2009 and 2018. He started working as a materials handler for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, in December 2018. He also continued working for the home inspection company on a part-time basis. Applicant makes between $65,000 and $70,000 a year. About $10,000 a year comes from his part-time job, and $55,000 to $60,000 a year comes from his position with a federal contractor. (Tr. 62-63) After deductions, his net salary or take-home pay is about $2,318. His expenses, including groceries, utilities, car and medical, and miscellaneous expenses amount to about $1,467. His mortgage is $642 a month. Applican",

I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits (GE 1 through 5). GE 5 \nwas admitted post-hearing. It is an IRS Form 1099-C concerning one of the accounts \ndisclosed by Applicant in his 2019 SCA, but not alleged in the SOR. Applicant gave the \nform to the Government after his interview. \nApplicant submitted exhibits (AE) A through H with his answer to the SOR. \nBefore the hearing, Applicant electronically submitted AE I through M. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) \nreceived by DOHA on May 28, 2021. \nProcedural Issues \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of a GE 4, a summary of his September \n17, 2019, PSI with a government investigator, for lacking authentication. I sustained the \nobjection IAW Para. E3.1.20. of Directive 5220.6. GE 4 was marked and made part of \nthe record, but was not admitted or considered as evidence. (Tr. 8) \nAt the end of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by \nadding an additional financial allegation concerning one of the delinquent accounts \nApplicant disclosed in his 2019 SCA. This was not new information or evidence \nadmitted during the hearing. The Government had the information concerning the \ndelinquent account in its possession since Applicant submitted his 2019 SCA. Applicant \ndid not receive 15 days of notice that the allegation would be used for disqualifying \nreasons. To avoid unnecessary delays, I exercised my discretion and denied the \nGovernment\u2019s motion. (Tr. 68 \u2013 72) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted (with comments and explanations) \nthe financial allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c (owing one creditor for three accounts in \ncollection for $22,226 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $3,941 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and $7,240 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). His \nSOR admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact: \nApplicant is 36 years old. He graduated from high school in 2001, and received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He has never been married and has no children.

He then worked in different positions \nfor a home inspection company between 2009 and 2018. He started working as a \nmaterials handler for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, \nin December 2018. He also continued working for the home inspection company on a \npart-time basis. \nApplicant makes between $65,000 and $70,000 a year. About $10,000 a year \ncomes from his part-time job, and $55,000 to $60,000 a year comes from his position \nwith a federal contractor. (Tr. 62-63) After deductions, his net salary or take-home pay is \nabout $2,318. His expenses, including groceries, utilities, car and medical, and \nmiscellaneous expenses amount to about $1,467. His mortgage is $642 a month. \nApplicant believes that he is currently financially stable. His income allows him to pay \nhis living expenses and debts. (Tr. 38-41) \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2019 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed the three accounts alleged in the SOR and two additional accounts that were \nnot alleged. One was a credit card account for $3,160 that he failed to pay. The creditor \nissued him an IRS Form 1099-C, cancellation of debt, and he reported it in his 2014 \nincome tax return. The second account was for a 2013 loan for $7,000 to install \nwindows in his house that became delinquent for lack of payments. Applicant averred \nhe believe the debt was also cancelled because it indicated a \u201c0\u201d balance in his credit \nreport, and the creditor did not attempt to collect. \nApplicant testified that before he received the SOR, he retained the services of a \ncredit-repair company seeking assistance to resolve his delinquent accounts. The \ncredit-repair company advised him not to repay the three delinquent accounts alleged in \nthe SOR and the $7,000 loan, because they were beyond the statute of limitations and \nuncollectable by legal means. Applicant followed the credit-repair company\u2019s advice and \nignored his delinquent debts. After receiving the SOR, Applicant realized he was given \nbad advice for purposes of receiving access to classified information. He hired an \nattorney to help him negotiate settlements with his creditors and to address the SOR \nconcerns. \nApplicant testified that his financial problems were caused by his alcohol abuse \nbetween 2002 and 2014. He was drinking too much alcohol too often. He was hungover \nmost mornings and could not accomplish his goals at work. Because he was drinking \ntoo often, he was spending beyond his financial means and accumulated large amounts \nof credit card debt. His utilities were shut off for nonpayment, and all of his credit cards \nwere closed for being delinquent. (GE 1, Section 24 (Alcohol)) \nIn 2014, after his second driving-while-intoxicated conviction, Applicant stopped \nconsuming alcohol. He successfully attended alcohol counseling between 2014 and \n2018. During the same period, he also attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. \nHe has continued to attend AA meetings to present.

During the pandemic, his AA attendance has been reduced to two times a \nmonth, but he believes participating in AA has been helpful to him, and he would like to \nincrease his attendance. Applicant credibly testified that he has been abstinent since \n2014. \nIn November 2020, Applicant contacted the creditor holding the three accounts \nalleged in the SOR. The bank agreed to settle the accounts for less than owed: the \n$22,226 account was settled for $7,800; the $3,941 account was settled for $1,400; and \nthe $7,240 account was settled for $2,555. In April 2021, Applicant paid in full all the \nsettled accounts. (AE A \u2013 D, and I \u2013 L) With his grandfather\u2019s financial help (a gift of \nabout $100,000) and by refinancing the home he inherited from his parents, Applicant \nwas able to resolve his delinquent debt, except for a $7,000 debt not alleged in the \nSOR. \nApplicant participated in a financial counseling course in December 2020, and \ntestified he is following a budget. He noted that he has not acquired any additional \ndelinquent debts since 2014. He believes that all of his financial problems were caused \nby his alcohol abuse. He has learned a hard lesson as a result of his financial problems \nand the clearance process. He now knows that he has to maintain financial \nresponsibility to be eligible for a clearance and to retain his job. He promised to maintain \nfinancial responsibility in the future. He believes that as long as he maintains his \nsobriety, he will be able to maintain his financial responsibility and will not be a security \nrisk. \nApplicant submitted numerous reference letters from his direct manager, \ncolleagues, friends, and family members. His references lauded his work ethic, \npersonality, and ability to work under pressure. He is considered to be an asset to his \ncompany, and he is professional, trustworthy, dependable, and committed to doing a \ngood job. His references endorsed his eligibility for a clearance. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be \nconsidered. [First time SEAD used] \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He defaulted on the \nthree credit-card accounts alleged in the SOR, and they were in collection. He also \ndefaulted on a $7,000 loan not alleged in the SOR. Because it was not alleged, I will \nonly consider the defaulted loan for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation and for the whole-person concept. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 19(a) is partially applicable because Applicant acquired the delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR before 2014, and he has not acquired any additional \ndelinquent debts after 2014. However, he just settled and paid the three accounts \nalleged in the SOR, and he still has one defaulted loan that he failed to pay. Thus, the \nfinancial problems are recent. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is not supported by the facts in this case and it is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (d) are applicable. Applicant sought financial assistance from a \ncredit-repair company before he received the SOR. However, he was provided with bad \nadvice about the appropriateness of utilization of the statute of limitations to avoid \npayment of delinquent debts that remain relevant for security clearance purposes. After \nreceipt of the SOR and realizing that the credit-repair company advice was wrong, \nApplicant retained an attorney that helped him to settle and pay his delinquent \naccounts. Additionally, he participated in financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s evidence \nestablishes that he has resolved the three accounts alleged in the SOR and his finances \nare under control. \nI considered that Applicant did not address his delinquent accounts until after he \nreceived the SOR. However, he credibly testified that he did not realize the credit-repair \ncompany\u2019s advice was wrong until he received the SOR and his attorney explained to \nhim the adverse effects of being financially irresponsible on a clearance eligibility \ndetermination.

His past financial behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate \ndetermination\u201d of whether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 36, has worked for a federal contractor since December 2018. This is \nhis first clearance application. Applicant has been sober, and has acquired no \ndelinquent debts since 2014. He was lauded by his supervisors and colleagues for his \njob performance, professionalism, trustworthiness, and dependability. I believe that \nApplicant will maintain his financial responsibility in the future. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He has deep loyalties and a sense of \nobligation for his family in Iraq. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 9, 2018, \nseeking clearance eligibility for a position with a federal contractor. He answered an \ninterrogatory from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and corrected \nand adopted summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted by the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigators on August 29, 2018; October 5, \n2018; November 21, 2018; May 31, 2019; and August 21, 2019.

On \nAugust 17, 2021, the DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled, with \nApplicant\u2019s consent, for August 25, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled.

Post-hearing, \nApplicant submitted AE P through Y on September 10, 2021. All of the exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objections, except for AE J, which I admitted over \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objections because the objections went to the weight of the \nevidence and not admissibility. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a complete document \n(unsigned - AE X) making most of Department Counsel\u2019s objections moot. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admissibility of AE X. \nProcedural Issue \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts \nconcerning the Federal Republic of Iraq, its internal and external affairs, and its relations \nwith the United States, to determine whether foreign influence security concerns are \nraised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. (HE 2) Applicant did not object to me taking \nadministrative notice of those facts, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. \nIn Guideline B cases, I am required to consider, among other things, the nature \nof a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord to assess the likelihood that an applicant or his family members are vulnerable to \npressure or coercion. The facts administratively noticed are set forth in the last two \nparagraphs of the Findings of Fact, infra. \nI note; however, that the U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is: \u201cDo \nnot travel to Iraq due to Covid-19, terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, and Mission\u2019s \nIraq limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens\u201d.

Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions and those at \nhis hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nThis is Applicant\u2019s first SCA. A federal contractor is sponsoring him for his \nclearance. His employment is contingent on his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant, his parents, brother, and two sisters were born and raised in Iraq. His \nparents are U.S. permanent residents and possess state identification cards. (AE D, L) \nHis father is 70 years old, and his mother is 65. He testified that his parent\u2019s plan is to \nbecome U.S. citizens, and they are in the process of doing so. (Tr. 26, SOR Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s father retired from his sensitive position with the Iraqi government in \n2015. His parents have been traveling to the United States twice a year since 2015. \nThey stay with him or his sister for about four months during each visit. During his 2018 \nPSI, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he was having weekly telephone contacts \nwith his parents. (GE 2, PSI of August 2018) At hearing, Applicant testified that he \ncommunicates with his parents \u201ctwice a month, once a month. Every two months one \ntime.\u201d (Tr. 48) He stated that his parents are elderly, and he checks on them about twice \na month. He claimed they never discuss work during their conversations. When asked \nwhether his father was receiving a pension from the government of Iraq, Applicant \nstated that he does not know. (Tr. 47) \nApplicant\u2019s father owns the family home in Baghdad, Iraq. During his August \n2018 PSI (AE 2), Applicant disclosed that his mother has owned an apartment in \nAmman, Jordan, since before 2009; she purchased it with an inheritance. At his \nhearing, he denied knowing whether his mother owns the apartment, but admitted \nstaying there with his parents in 2009. (Tr. 53) Applicant\u2019s brother currently resides with \nhis parents in their home. He believes his brother will inherit his father\u2019s home, because \nhe is the oldest son. (Tr. 53) \nApplicant\u2019s father held a sensitive, important position with the Iraqi government. \nHe was in charge of a large and important Iraqi government agency. In that position, he \nworked closely with senior U.S. military commanders between 2004 and 2010. AE S \nthrough V contain multiple images depicting Applicant\u2019s father in the company of many \nU.S. and NATO senior military commanders exchanging gifts, letters of appreciation, \ncommendations, and sharing meals. AE U is an email from a renowned U.S. senior \nmilitary commander (retired) stating that Applicant\u2019s father was an exceedingly good \nman and a great leader.

(AE W) \nApplicant\u2019s sister (F), 34, is a housewife and lives in Iraq with her husband and \ntwo children. He traveled to Iraq in 2013 for his sister\u2019s wedding. In his answer to the \nSOR and at his hearing, Applicant claimed he speaks to his sister and brother-in-law \ntwo or three times a year. During his August 2018 interview, Applicant stated he was \nhaving telephonic contact with his sister weekly and with his brother-in-law about twice \na year. (GE 2) The last time he saw her in person was in 2018, when he vacationed in \nAmman, Jordan, with his wife. Applicant\u2019s sister (R) is a resident of the United States. \nShe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2011. (AE C) \nApplicant\u2019s brother, age 41, works in the office of an important Iraqi official. (Tr. \n25, 28) He is married with two children. Applicant claimed he does not communicate \nvery often with his brother due to their age differences, and he estimated the frequency \nof their communications to be about two or three times a year. The last time Applicant \nsaw his brother in person was in August 2020, when his brother visited the United \nStates on a working trip. In addition to his sister and brother, Applicant has two cousins \nwho are residents and citizens of Iraq. They both are company grade officers and are \nemployed by two different Iraqi police organizations. He denied that he has frequent \ncontact with them. (GE 2, August 2019 PSI) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is 27 years old. They met in 2017, and they were married in \n2019. She has not been to Iraq since 2006 when she immigrated to the United States. \n(Tr. 12) She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March 2012. (AE B) She completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in January 2018. (AE Q) She works as a contractor with another \ngovernment agency. Applicant claimed his wife holds a top-secret clearance with \naccess to sensitive compartment information (SCI). His wife has participated in at least \nfive security-related courses and attended an annual security-awareness conference in \n2019. (AE Q) She stated that she has been an assistant facility security officer (FSO), \nand that her father, sister, and brother have access to classified information.

(AE A) \nApplicant was issued an Iraqi passport that he used to enter the United States, \nand to travel to Iraq in 2013. He told a government investigator that his Iraqi passport \nexpired in 2015-2016, and he shredded it.

He told the investigator that he believed his father shredded \nhis Iraqi passport, but he never saw him do it. (GE 2, August 2019 PSI; Question 3, \nAnswer to interrogatories) \nApplicant was financially supported by his father while unemployed and attending\nschool between 2011 and 2016. His father provided him with $4,000 a month during \nthat period. He was hired by his current employer, a private company, in October 2016.\nAfter he started working for his employer, his father provided him with around $2,000 a\nmonth to pay his rent because his income was insufficient. (GE 2, PSI August 2018) As\nof August 2019, his father was giving him $2,300 monthly to pay his rent.

U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk \nfor kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active \nin Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias and criminal elements may also threaten U.S. citizens and \nwestern companies throughout Iraq. \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and two siblings are citizen-residents of Iraq. He maintains a \nclose relationship with his relatives in Iraq as demonstrated by his and his family\u2019s \nfrequent contacts and communications with them, and the financial support he received \nfrom his father though the years. His father served over 45 years in the Iraqi military and \nheld a sensitive and important position in the Iraqi government. His brother currently \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nworks for an important senior official in the Iraqi government. Also, he has two cousins \nwho are company grade officers in the Iraqi police. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThere is substantial evidence of a significant threat of terror, sectarian violence, \ncriminal activity, and ongoing human rights problems in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts may create a potential conflict of interest, and there is evidence of a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to his parents and siblings, and their \nconnections to Iraq are sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq as well as each individual \nfamily tie. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. \nTravel within Iraq remains very dangerous and the ability of the Iraqi government \nor the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are \nat high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist, insurgent groups, \nand criminals are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and \ncivilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias and criminal elements may also threaten U.S. \ncitizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Severe human rights problems are \nwidespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of transparency \nat all levels of government and society weakened the government\u2019s authority. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant has not met his burden of showing that he \nis not likely to be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nfamily members and the interests of the United States. \nBecause of his relatives in Iraq, Applicant could be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a family member and the interests of the United \nStates. However, there is no evidence of any actions taken by any Iraqi person, group, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has established himself in the United States. He immigrated in 2010 \nand became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018. He has been employed since 2016, and \nhe is considered to be a productive employee, and a loyal American citizen. He married \nin 2019, and they are expecting their first child. He has not been back to Iraq since \n2013. He testified that he and his wife are not interested in visiting Iraq again. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents have permanent U.S. resident cards, but they are resident-\ncitizens of Iraq. They live in Iraq when not in the United States. They travel to the United \nStates twice a year, and stay for about four months. Applicant believes that his parents\u2019 \nintention is to become U.S. citizens. When his parents are in Iraq they are vulnerable to \nthe problematic conditions and circumstances in Iraq. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was a very important and prominent Iraqi official and held a \nsensitive position in the Iraqi government for many years. He worked closely with senior \nU.S. and NATO military commanders in the reunification of Iraq, fighting terrorism, \ninsurgents, and organized crime. He distinguished himself for his leadership, being loyal \nto his country and the people of Iraq, and as a great humanitarian. U.S. commanders \nconsider him to be trustworthy, a good man, and a great leader. He refused to be \nintimidated by Iranian-supported entities and other Iraqi factions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \norganization, or government interest against his parents or siblings living in Iraq \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s employment in the United States. \nBecause of his prominence within the Iraqi government and his close working \nrelationship with U.S. commanders, Applicant\u2019s father could be easily recognized and \nbecome a possible target for terrorists, insurgents, and organized crime. Anyone \nseeking U.S. classified information could threaten or use Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq to \nattempt to manipulate, influence, or pressure him to obtain such information. \nApplicant\u2019s two siblings in Iraq have families and are established there. There is \nno evidence to show they are interested in moving to the United States. His brother \nworks in a sensitive government office and is assigned to work with a senior \ngovernment official. His brother\u2019s prominence increases the security concern. Both \nsiblings and their families could be used to manipulate, influence, or pressure Applicant. \nI considered that Applicant\u2019s parents have a property in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s and his \nsiblings\u2019 interests in that property would not accrue until his father\u2019s passing. Thus, at \nthis point, his interest in the property is speculative According to Applicant\u2019s testimony, \nhis older brother currently resides in the property, and is likely to inherit it. Applicant\u2019s \ninterest in the Iraqi property is unlikely to result in a conflict of interest and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure him. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. Applicant has a strong attachment to the United \nStates and one sister, an aunt, and some cousins that live in the United States. \nNotwithstanding, his parents, older brother and sister and their families and his other \nextended family member live in Iraq. Applicant received substantial financial support \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \nfrom his father from 2010 until at least August 2019. He does not own a home or have \nany other financial investments in the United States, except for a $4,000 checking bank \naccount. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant has given inconsistent information about \nthe frequency of contacts with his parents and siblings. It appears that Applicant tried to \nminimize his contacts with his parents and siblings in his answers to the SOR and at his \nhearing, but admitted frequent contacts in his PSIs. Nevertheless, even if Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts were infrequent, he has not overcome the presumption that they are not \ncasual. See ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Applicant\u2019s \ncontradictions raise concerns about the veracity of other mitigating testimony and \ninformation. \nOn balance, I find that Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by family members residing in Iraq. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant evidence is insufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINS APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 42 years old. In 2006, he married his wife, and they separated in December 2013. They have a 12-year-old son. Applicant has worked for his employer since 2012, where he is currently a director. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 2006. His employer has requested that Applicant be issued a DOD security clearance in order to enable him to perform specific employment duties. (Item 2) Applicant admitted the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g, and denied the remaining debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d., 1.e, and 1.f.) The total amount of indebtedness alleged is $71,131, which includes over $21,500 in federal tax liens. (Items 1 \u2013 7; AE A) Applicant stated in his SOR response that he was actively working to resolve his delinquent accounts. Although the SOR alleged indebtedness totaled $71,131, he claimed that he had reduced the overall amount of indebtedness to $48,760. On May 25, 2021, I requested Applicant provide updated documentation to show his history of payments and the current status of his SOR accounts. I held the record open for ten days in the event he wanted to submit this requested documentation. On June 4, 2021, Applicant provided the requested updated information that he attached to his original SOR response. (AE A, AE B) According to Applicant, his financial issues worsened in approximately 2014, following the separation from his spouse in late 2013. She had sporadic employment from 2013 to 2017, after which time she was no longer employed. S",

On \nOctober 15, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On December 16, 2020, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nincluding pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7.

Applicant did not respond to the FORM, and \nthe case was assigned to me on March 9, 2021. I admitted Items 1 through 7 into evidence \nwithout objection. \nOn May 25, 2021, I requested Applicant provide updated information since the \ndocuments he provided with his response to the SOR were no longer current. I held the \nrecord open until June 4, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Applicant provided updated information \nthat he attached to his original SOR response. I have labeled his SOR response and \nattachments as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, and his most recent submission of updated \ndocumentation as AE B. These documents were admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 42 years old. In 2006, he married his wife, and they separated in \nDecember 2013. They have a 12-year-old son. Applicant has worked for his employer \nsince 2012, where he is currently a director. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 2006. His \nemployer has requested that Applicant be issued a DOD security clearance in order to \nenable him to perform specific employment duties. (Item 2) \nApplicant admitted the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g, and denied the \nremaining debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d., 1.e, and 1.f.) The total amount of indebtedness \nalleged is $71,131, which includes over $21,500 in federal tax liens. (Items 1 \u2013 7; AE A) \nApplicant stated in his SOR response that he was actively working to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. Although the SOR alleged indebtedness totaled $71,131, he \nclaimed that he had reduced the overall amount of indebtedness to $48,760. On May 25, \n2021, I requested Applicant provide updated documentation to show his history of \npayments and the current status of his SOR accounts. I held the record open for ten days \nin the event he wanted to submit this requested documentation. On June 4, 2021, \nApplicant provided the requested updated information that he attached to his original SOR \nresponse. (AE A, AE B) \nAccording to Applicant, his financial issues worsened in approximately 2014, \nfollowing the separation from his spouse in late 2013. She had sporadic employment from \n2013 to 2017, after which time she was no longer employed. Since she has earned the \nsame amount of income, or more, as compared to Applicant, the loss of her income during \ntheir separation was a major factor contributing to their financial problems. He fully \nsupported his family although they are separated, and his spouse continued to have \naccess to their joint bank account. She uses his income to pay their joint accounts as well \nas to fund her and their son\u2019s living expenses. His spouse has always handled the family \nfinances. Applicant described his financial situation as acceptable, but disorganized. He \nhas never participated in financial counseling. When he submitted updated information to \nthe record on June 4, 2021, he reported that his spouse had been hired in early 2021 and \nis currently employed.

As of April 2020, the current account balance \nwas $8,410. As of June 4, 2021, the outstanding balance was $6,380. This delinquent \naccount is in the process of being resolved. (Item 1, Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6; AE A, \nAE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant is indebted to Bank of America for a charged-off \naccount in the amount of $7,453. He admitted this debt and intends to settle this debt, but \nhe has prioritized other delinquent accounts to pay before he takes any action on this \naccount. Based on the updated information provided on June 4, 2021, Applicant recently \nhired an attorney to negotiate a settlement with the creditor, but a settlement resolution \nhas not yet been reached. This debt has not yet been resolved. (Item 1; AE A, AE B) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e allege student loan accounts placed for collection with \nECMC in the total amount of $21,144. Applicant admitted he owed these debts but denied \nthe SOR allegations since he was in the process of consolidating the three student loans \ninto a single loan through FedLoan Servicing. If the consolidation is approved, it would \ntake the student loans out of \u201cdelinquent\u201d status. Updated information provided on June \n4, 2021, showed that the loan consolidation was approved in January 2021, and since \nthat time, Applicant has made consistent monthly payments of $240.88. There is sufficient \nevidence to show that the student loans are currently in the process of being resolved. \n(Item 1, Item 4, Item 5; AE A, AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal government in the amount \nof $9,824 after a tax lien was entered against him in 2014. He denied this tax debt and \nprovided documentation with his SOR response that the 2011 tax debt had been resolved \nand the tax lien released in October 2020. (Item 1, AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a 2019 Federal tax lien in the amount of $11,753. Applicant \nadmitted this Federal tax debt and stated in his SOR response that he was in the process \nof working with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve this debt. On June 4, 2021, \nApplicant provided updated information to show that the tax debt has been paid and the \ntax lien was released in April 2021. (Item 1; AE B) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201cSecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that are disqualifying. The following are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f). \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is evidence in the record that Applicant\u2019s finances suffered due to a 2013 \nseparation and worsened from his wife\u2019s inability to find employment following their \nseparation. These are circumstances beyond his control. He continued to finance two \nhouseholds and fully supported his spouse and child to at least early 2021, at which time \nhis spouse found employment. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances \nwhen he had his student loans consolidated and taken out of default status. He acted \nresponsibly and showed good faith by contacting his creditors to arrange payment plans \nor settlements, and made consistent payments in accordance with the payment plan. He \npaid his delinquent taxes in full and the tax liens were released. Applicant made significant \nprogress resolving his delinquent debts, and it is clear that he is committed to repaying \nall of his outstanding accounts. Under the current circumstances, there are clear \nindications that his finances are under control and are unlikely to recur. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d) and (g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. The record provides sufficient evidence \nto demonstrate that he is reliable, trustworthy, and exercises good judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant has met his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/31/2021 \nDecision \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) intent to deny his eligibility \nfor a security clearance to work in the defense industry. He was convicted three times of \nDriving While Intoxicated (DWI). Additionally, he pled no contest to violation of probation \nand remains on unsupervised probation. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 15, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a SOR to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue a security clearance eligibility for him. \nThe DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nIn an undated response to the SOR, Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On November 23, 2020, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), consisting of six exhibits (Items 1 - 6). On December 1, 2020, Applicant received \na copy of the FORM, which instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. As of \nFebruary 2, 2021, no response had been received. I was assigned the case to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. \nEvidentiary Ruling \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 6 a Summary of Personal Subject \nInterview (PSI) conducted by the Office of Personnel Management investigators with \nApplicant on January 14, 2020. The summary was part of the DoD Report of Investigation \n(ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DoD personnel background \nreport of investigation may be received in evidence and considered with an authenticating \nwitness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The \ninterview summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility under \n\u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview (PSI) where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to \nit; and there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this \ncase, Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to \nsubmit objections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. \nThe FORM contained the following warning: \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interviews (PSI) (Exhibit 6) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can \ncomment on whether each PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you may make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground \nthat the report is unauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections \nare raised in your response to this FORM, or if you do not respond to this \nFORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the Administrative Judge may \ndetermine that you have waived any objections to the admissibility of the \nsummary and may consider the summary as evidence in your case. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the \nlegal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process \nrights or protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. \nHe was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nhe was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive \ndoes not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was \nplaced on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview \nsummary, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, \nor updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not object to the FORM or \nindicate that the PSI contained inaccurate information. \nIn December 2018, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a state university. \n(Item 3) He can reasonably be held to have understood his obligation to object to the PSI \nor indicate that it contained inaccurate information. Accordingly, I accepted Item 6 in the \nrecord, subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nSummary of SOR Allegations \nApplicant has been arrested three times for DWI. He was found guilty once and \npled guilty twice. Additionally, he pled no contest to a Violation of Probation. (Item1) From \nJanuary 2019 through August 23, 2019, he was incarcerated following his most recent \nconviction. His first DWI occurred before he was of legal drinking age. Applicant admitted \nthe allegations. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter considering the FORM, exhibits to the FORM, and Applicant\u2019s admissions to \nthe SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old and single. He has worked for a defense contractor as a \njunior imagery analyst since November 2019. (Item 3) He seeks to obtain a security \nclearance. He has not served in the military. In December 2018, he obtained a bachelor \ndegree. \nOn January 18, 2016, Applicant was at a fraternity house party celebrating his 20th  \nbirthday. (Item 6) He remembers having one drink at 10 p.m. and had no memory of what \nhappened the rest of the evening. He was arrested at 4 a.m. and woke up in jail. (Item 6) \nHe had been found in his car, which was parked on top of a tree stump. (Item 5) Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with \u201cDriving While Intoxicated (DWI), 1st Offense.\u201d He spent \none night in jail following his arrest. (Item 6) On March 16, 2016, he was found guilty, and \nordered to pay a fine of $800, sentenced to 90 days in jail (all suspended), and placed on \none year of supervised probation. He was also ordered to attend an Alcohol Safety Action \nProgram (ASAP), which he completed on March 3, 2017. (Item 5) What, if any, knowledge \nor insight he gained from this ten weeks of alcohol education classes is not included in \nthe record. He admits being immature at the time of his first arrest. Following his court \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nappearance, he stated he did not make any changes to his alcohol consumption. (Item 6) \nApplicant described his drinking at the time of his first DWI was drinking on weekends \nand was drinking to get drunk, but not to the point of blacking out. (Item 6) \nOn March 16, 2016, the day Applicant was to appear in court on his first DWI, he \nwas arrested for improper driving for driving 110 miles per hour in a 75 miles per hour \nzone. His excuse was that he knew he would lose his driving privileges for one year so \nhe thought he would have one last driving spree before appearing in court. (Item 5, 6) He \npaid a $500 fine. (Item 6) \nApplicant retained his driving privileges in July 2017. On September 9, 2017, he \nwent to a bar and drank with friends. He then went to a friend\u2019s house and continued \ndrinking. He then decided to joyride around town before being arrested at 3 a.m. (Item 6) \nHe was jailed for the night and bailed out the next day. He admits being immature at the \ntime and motivated at the time to show off for his friends. (Item 6) Again, following his \ncourt appearance for his second DWI, he stated he did not make any changes to his \nalcohol consumption. (Item 6) \nOn September 9, 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with \u201cDWI: 2nd \nOffense Within 5 Years\u201d with a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .15% to .20%. Prior to his \nsecond DWI arrest, he knowingly drove while intoxicated, believing at the time that he \nwas invincible. He pled guilty, and was fined $1,000, sentenced to 12 months in jail (10 \nmonths, 20 days suspended), and placed on probation for two years. He spent 40 days \nin jail. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for three years. (Item 6) He had an interlock \ndevice installed on his vehicle. (Item 5) He was again ordered to attend an ASAP, which \nhe completed in February or March 2018. (Item 5) What, if any, knowledge or insight he \nreceived from this four weeks of alcohol education classes is not included in the record. \nHe stated he did not make any changes to his alcohol consumption after his second \noffense. (Item 6) \nApplicant described his drinking at the time of his 2nd DWI as drinking four days a \nweek and drinking to get drunk. He acknowledges blacking out a few times, but asserts \nthis was unintentional. (Item 6) \nOn December 28, 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with \u201cDWI: 3rd \nOffense Within 5 Years (felony)\u201d and \u201cDriving After Revoked License.\u201d He pled guilty on \nor about August 23, 2019, and was sentenced to two years in jail (1 year, 5 months \nsuspended), and to one year supervised probation and two years of unsupervised \nprobation. He was in jail for seven months. His driver\u2019s license was indefinitely \nsuspended, and he was ordered to attend another ASAP for four weeks. For driving after \nforfeiture of license, he was sentenced to six months in jail (suspended). (Item 5) The two \nsentences were to be served concurrently. (Item 6) \nAt the time of Applicant\u2019s third DWI, he had just graduated from a university, and \nit was his first night back in town. He went drinking with friends at a bar before going to a \nfriend\u2019s home to continue drinking. He and his friend then went to a fast-food restaurant. \nPrior to going through the driving-thru, Applicant and his friend changed seats because \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof a run-in his friend had early in the day at the same establishment. Applicant knew his \nlicense was suspended, but he decided to drive anyway. He was arrested, and his \nbreathalyzer test registered a .09% BAC. \nApplicant remained in jail after his arrest on December 28, 2018, until February 13, \n2019. At that time, he was allowed to enroll in an alcohol-recovery retreat program until \nMarch 13, 2019, where he was diagnosed with \u201cAlcohol Abuse.\u201d He returned to jail on \nMarch 23, 2019. He remained in jail until August 23, 2019, when he appeared in court to \nbe sentenced for his 3rd  DWI. (Item 6) What he learned from the alcohol-recovery retreat \nis not part of the record.  \nApplicant asserted he was more mature at the time of his 3rd  DWI arrest than he \nwas during his previous two DWI arrests. He said he just has to say \u201cno\u201d to his friends. \n(Item 6) He stated he had decided to leave the fraternity and move in with his father. It \nshould be noted that his third DWI occurred after he had graduated from the university, \nwhich would normally result in an individual no longer living in a fraternity home. (Item 6)  \nOn April 1, 2019 Applicant was charged with Violation of Probation for the sentence \nimposed for his September 2017 DWI. He pled no contest, and the remaining 10 months, \n20 days of his sentence was imposed (9 months suspended). His driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended until ordered by the court to be returned. (Item 5) From January 2019 until \nAugust 23, 2019, he remained in jail. (Item 6) \nAs of January 2020, when Applicant completed his enhanced PSI, he had yet to \ncomplete the ASAP classes. (Item 6) He stated he was waiting to take the classes to a \ndate closer to when his driver\u2019s license will be reinstated, because once he completes the \nclasses, he will have to check in with the program every three months until his license is \nreinstated and he will also have to make a payment on checking in. Although his license \nwas indefinitely suspended, Applicant believes his license will be reinstated in 2024. (Item \n6) He believes his driver\u2019s license suspension was for five years. He plans to attend the \nrequired classes closer to his reinstatement date in order to save money. (Item 6)  \nApplicant asserts he has stopped the \u201cparty lifestyle\u201d and will not get behind the \nwheel after drinking. (Item 6) He asserts he no longer drinks to get drunk. He maintains \nthat he now makes better choices and usually obeys all laws. (Item 6) He continues to \ndrink alcohol. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant has been arrested and convicted of DWI three times. His first DWI arrest \nwas before he had attained legal drinking age. His BAC at the time of his second arrest \nwas .15% to .20%, evidencing a high level of intoxication and a high frequency of \nconsumption. All three convictions resulted in him being sentenced to jail. He served one \nmonth and 10 days in jail on his second conviction and six months on his third conviction. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe continued to drink alcohol to excess even after attending court ordered ASAPs. As of \nthe date of his PSI, he had yet to complete the state ASAP, and there is no evidence in \nthe record that he has completed that court-ordered alcohol program. He has also \nexperienced blackouts while drinking. \nTwo disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 23. Those conditions that could possibly mitigate alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns are: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has \nno history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple alcohol-related offenses raise considerable concerns for his \njudgment and reliability. His DWI arrests started before he reached the legal age to \nconsume alcohol. Alcohol-awareness programs and even time in jail did not deter him \nfrom overindulging in drinking and then driving. After his first DWI, he lost his license for \none year. Two months after he reacquired his license, he was again arrested for DWI. \nPrior to his second DWI arrest, he knowingly drove while intoxicated, believing at the time \nhe was invincible. He now asserts he has stopped the \u201cparty lifestyle\u201d and no longer drives \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafter drinking, but his current level of alcohol consumption is unknown. He asserts he now \ndrinks more responsibly, but provided no evidence of moderating his drinking except for \nhis self-serving statement. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The relatively short period of time that has \npassed since Applicant=s last alcohol-related incident and treatment, coupled with his \nhistory of prior alcohol-related incidents, treatments, and relapses precludes application \nof AG \u00b6 23(a). This mitigating condition cannot reasonably apply to such a recent episode \nof serious binge drinking with blackout. His latest arrest was in December 2018. At the \ntime of his enhanced subject interview, he was still drinking. Not enough time has passed \nsince his last arrest to guarantee against a recurrence of abusive consumption. The \nbehavior was not infrequent, nor did it happen under unusual circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 23 (b) \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption of abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d does not apply. Applicant has been \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Abuse and asserted, but failed to provide documentation showing \nthat he uses alcohol responsibly. \nNeither AG \u00b6 23 (c) \u201cthe individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program,\u201d nor AG \u00b6 23(d) \u201cthe individual has successfully \ncompleted a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated \na clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations,\u201d applies. He returned to drinking to excess after two court-\nordered ASAPs. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s underage drinking to intoxication resulting in a DWI in \nJanuary 2016, his DWIs committed in September 2017 and December 2018, and his \nviolation of probation in April 2019 raise serious criminal conduct security concerns. \nAlthough not specifically alleged in the SOR, the evidence also shows that he drove 110 \nmph in a 75-mph zone on the day he was to appear for sentencing for his first DWI \nconviction. He said he was speeding because he knew he was going to lose his driving \nprivilege for one year once he was went to court on the DWI. While that conduct cannot \nbe considered for disqualifying purposes, it reflects serious immaturity and a lack of \nreform that weights against him under the whole-person evaluation. \nIn August 2019, Applicant was sentenced to one year supervised probation for his \nthird DWI, two years unsupervised probation for driving without a license, and sentenced \nto two years in prison, of which he served seven months. On April 1, 2019, he was \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharged with violation of probation, pled no contest, and the remaining 10 months, 20 \ndays of his sentence was imposed (9 months was suspended). \nFour disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 are established, as follows: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program.  \nApplicant has the burden of establishing the applicability of one or more of the \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32, which provide: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited\nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher\neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity\ninvolvement. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant remains on unsupervised probation. What he learned during his \nFebruary 2019 alcohol treatment at the recovery retreat program and from his first two \ncourt-ordered ASAPs is unknown. He has not completed the court-ordered ASAP for his \nthird DWI and does not intend to do so until closer to the time of his driver\u2019s license \nreinstatement. His decision not to attend ASAP at this time is that it will cost him money \nevery three months when he has to check in after completing ASAP and prior to his \nlicense being reinstated. He asserts that he has stopped the \u201cparty lifestyle,\u201d has learned \nto say \u201cno\u201d to his friends, and now drinks responsibly. However, it is too soon to conclude \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he possesses the requisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness for security \nclearance eligibility. The criminal conduct security concerns are not adequately mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guidelines G and J are incorporated in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a lengthy history of repeated alcohol-related incidents, completion \nof alcohol safety-awareness programs followed by periods of excessive alcohol \nconsumption and driving under the influence. Abusive drinking raises concerns about \nwhether Applicant possesses the judgment, self-control, and other characteristics \nessential to protecting national security information. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense \nassessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nIndeed, the Awhole person@ concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of \ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into \nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, \nand careful analysis. Further, it must once again be noted that any reasonable doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him \nto provide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \nhistory of alcohol-related arrests and convictions. Applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion. In requesting an administrative determination, Applicant chose to rely on the \nwritten record. By so doing, and then not responding to the Government\u2019s file of relevant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nmaterial, he failed to submit sufficient information or evidence to supplement the record \nwith relevant and material facts regarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying solely on the admissions he made in his SOR \nResponse, the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns remain. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is whether his alcohol-related arrests raise concerns about his \nfitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCLAUDE R.

In 2011, his \ncontract ended and he moved to state \u201c3\u201d in 2012, to continue his work as an \nindependent contractor for federal contractors. (Tr. 55) Between 2008 and 2018, he \nheld secret and top-secret clearances working for federal contractors. He started \nworking for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, in \nFebruary 2021. He makes $115,000 a year, plus a $5,000 bonus from his employer. \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his August 2018 SCA, Applicant \nstated that he was working with a tax specialist to prepare delinquent federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He claimed his filing of \nthose income tax returns were delayed for many different reasons: in 2014, he had a \nloss of income from his rental property in state \u201c2\u201d and was forced to sell the property at \na loss; in 2015, he was laid off, and had income complications due to unemployment \ncompensation, filing for social security, and a new job with a significant loss in income; \nhe lost income from a rental property in state \u201c1\u201d; he had expensive repairs to a rental \nproperty; he had rental management expenses from May 2016 to September 2017 for a \nproperty in state \u201c1\u201d; several family members passed away; he and his wife were living \napart due to jobs or family issues; and he and his wife had many medical problems. \nDuring his January 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, \nApplicant said his goal was to have all of his delinquent income tax returns filed by \nSeptember 2019. He claimed that, in all the years in question, he had requested \nextensions to file, and had paid his taxes via income and retirement income deductions. \nHe failed to submit documentary evidence to show he requested extensions to file his \nincome tax returns for any of the years in question. The IRS transcripts for the TYs in \nquestion show that he paid part of the taxes owed via income deductions. The IRS \ntranscripts do not show filing extensions were requested. \nApplicant and his wife testified that she was in charge of the family finances and \nthe filing of the income tax returns. They confirmed that they had filed their income tax \nreturns late for tax years 2014 through 2017. They indicated they had been through at \nleast six tax preparers between 2014 and 2020. (AE W-1) \nThe IRS Transcript for TY 2013 (dated February 19, 2020), indicates Applicant \nfiled his 2013 income tax return on October 19, 2015.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

As alleged in the \nSOR, he failed to timely file state income tax returns for state \u201c3\u201d for TYs 2015 through \n2018, and federal income tax returns for TY 2018. Moreover, he failed to pay income \ntaxes as required and owes the IRS delinquent taxes for several years. \nI note that the record shows that Applicant failed to timely file both federal and \nstate \u201c3\u201d income tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2019. Because some of the years he \nfailed to timely file his income tax returns or to pay his taxes were not alleged in the \nSOR, I will only consider them for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence \nin mitigation. \nI also note that Applicant averred that the income tax returns filed for him by the \nIRS (when he failed to timely file his income tax returns) were incorrect. He anticipates \nowing less taxes after the IRS considers the correct income tax returns with the \nexemptions, credits, and deductions he was entitled to receive. The IRS will generally \nadjust accounts to reflect the correct figures. Notwithstanding, he still owes income \ntaxes for several years. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \n\u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns . . . or failure to \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record established \nthese disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant claimed that the filing of his income tax returns were delayed for many \ndifferent reasons: he had losses of income from his rental properties; he was forced to \nsell a property at a loss; he was laid off at the end of contracts; he had complications \ndue to unemployment compensation; he filed for social security; he had a new job with a \nsignificant loss in income; he had expensive repairs to a rental property; he had rental \nmanagement expenses; several family members passed away; during periods, he and \nhis wife were living apart due to having jobs in different states or family issues; and he \nand his wife suffered medical problems. \nSome of these circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and could have \nadversely affected his record collection and application of his time and energy to \naddress his taxes. However, these circumstances when considered in light of his age, \neducation, years of service, and the number of years without timely filing income tax \nreturns or paying his taxes, are insufficient to prove he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nIn regard to the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information.

As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

Aug. \n18, 2015).  \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax \nreturns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd.

June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts: \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \nNotwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when he filed his tax returns, the \nAppeal Board provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a \nsecurity clearance: \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government \nrules and regulations.

June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has filed all of his late income tax returns, \nalbeit on or after July 2020. He also made payment arrangements with the IRS to pay \nhis tax debt in 2019 and again 2021. However, he failed to present documentary \nevidence of any payments made pursuant to those payment arrangements. Moreover, \nthe timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. In ISCR \nCase No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the grant \nof a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal \nincome tax returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his \nbackground interview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such \nremedial action might otherwise merit. \nUnder all the circumstances, including the jurisprudence from the DOHA Appeal \nBoard, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that Applicant failed to timely file income tax returns for TYs \n2012 through 2017 in state \u201c1\u201d. I find that he was a non-resident of state \u201c1\u201d after 2008. \nHe was required to file income tax returns in state \u201c1\u201d because he had rental property \nincome, albeit negative income, and he would owe no taxes. Applicant averred he did \nnot file his income tax returns based on the incorrect advice from his tax preparers. I \nfind this allegation for Applicant. \nConsidering the record as a whole, I am unable to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to timely file his \nincome tax returns or to pay his delinquent income taxes. His financial issues are recent \nand ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Only AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because he filed his late income tax returns, \nbut it does not mitigate the security concerns. The other mitigating conditions are not \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d).

My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 69, honorably served in the Air Force 22 years and retired as a master \nsergeant (E-7). He held a secret clearance during most of his time in the service. He \nwas awarded, among others, the Meritorious Service Medal (3) and the Air Force \nCommendation Medal with 1 Bronze Star. The VA rated Applicant 90 percent disabled \ndue to service-connected injuries. Applicant and his wife have eight grown-up children \nand 18 grandchildren. Because of his military service and many family separations, his \nwife has been in charge of the family finances and the filing of the income tax returns for \nmany years. Applicant has worked for federal contractors from 2008 to present, holding \nsecret and top-secret clearances. \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. As \nalleged in the SOR, he failed to timely file state income tax returns for state \u201c3\u201d for TYs \n2015 through 2018, and federal income tax returns for TY 2018. Moreover, he failed to \npay income taxes as required and still owes the IRS delinquent taxes for several years. \nAs noted previously, the record evidence shows Applicant failed to timely file \nfederal and state income tax returns in state \u201c3\u201d for TYs 2013 through 2019. I note again \nthat some of the years he failed to timely file his income tax returns or to pay his taxes \nwere not alleged in the SOR. Thus, I will only consider them for the limited purpose of \nevaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. \nWhen a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) \n(reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve \nhis tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was \nin jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does \nnot reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-\n05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not \nall tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd.

Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted \nhis annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions \nto DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and expenses, and spouse\u2019s \nserious medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his \nfailure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax \nreturns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). See also \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security \nclearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of \nnational secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a \ndirect bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.\u201d).  \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant has known that he needed to file his \nstate and federal income tax returns for several years. Whether he knew he was going \nto receive refunds or had sufficient or insufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, he had a \nrequirement to timely file his tax returns. He did not fully understand or appreciate the \nimportance of timely filing of tax returns in security clearance determinations. He also \nprocrastinated paying his delinquent income taxes and still owes taxes for several \nyears. His recent actions in July 2020 are too little, too late to fully mitigate security \nconcerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated at \nthis time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant states that he has negotiated and settled the account owed to the \ncreditor.  He also states that he began a payment plan on August 27, 2020.  Applicant \nclaims that the account is no longer delinquent.  (Government Exhibit 2.)           \n \n1.f.  A delinquent account was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$15,732.  Applicant states that the account remains delinquent.  Applicant further states \nthat he is working with the financial assistance company to negotiate a settlement to \nresolve the debt.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  The account remains delinquent and owing.    \n \n1.g.  A delinquent account was charged off in the approximate amount of $1,890.     \nApplicant states that he has negotiated and settled the account owed to the creditor.  \nHe also states that he began a payment plan on February 25, 2019.

Applicant further states that he is \nworking with the financial assistance company to negotiate a settlement to resolve the \ndebt.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  The account remains delinquent and owing.    \n \nApplicant failed to submit documentation to substantiate a payment history of any \nsort.  There are no receipts, proof of payment, letters from creditors or bank statements \nto show that any payments have been made or what the amounts of the payments \nwere.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \n \nApplicant lived beyond his means for many years. He became delinquently \nindebted and unable to afford to pay his bills.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n\n \n6 \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant became excessively indebted \nbecause he spent money he did not have.  He opened up as many as 23 credit card \naccounts and spent money recklessly. When he became so overwhelmed and could no \nlonger handle his finances, in May 2018, he hired a financial repair service to help him.  \nThere is nothing in the record since then to show evidence of debt settlement or a \npayment history.  In the event that Applicant is making progress toward resolving his \ndebts, he is commended for it.  However, other than his averment, there is no \ndocumentary evidence of a payment history to show that Applicant has made progress \ntoward resolving his debts.  Even giving him the benefit of the doubt regarding the debts \nhe claims he has paid, he still owes a significant amount of debt that is delinquent.  \nApplicant has failed to show a pattern and practice of paying his bills on time.  He \nremains delinquently indebted to a number of creditors.  Accordingly, the financial \nconsiderations security concern has not been mitigated.  Guideline F is found against \nApplicant.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana for medicinal purposes. Marijuana, \nincluding medical marijuana, remains a controlled substance and illegal under federal \nlaw. She stated that she intended to continue using marijuana for medicinal purposes. \nThe above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant did not violate any state law when she used marijuana for medicinal \npurposes. It is possible that she did not fully understand that it is still a federal crime, \nand inconsistent with holding a security clearance. However, any doubt should have \nbeen eliminated when she received the FORM. She did not respond to the FORM, so I \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nhave to assume that nothing has changed. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not mitigated. Additionally, as an unlawful \nuser of a controlled substance, she is precluded from holding a security clearance by \nthe Bond Amendment.1 \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format), the official form used for personnel security investigations, on \nApril 17, 2018. (Exhibit 4) He was interviewed during the course of a 2019 background \ninvestigation.

In a July 2019 interview, in \nresponse to questions to clarify his history of marijuana use, he admitted first using \nmarijuana in autumn 2016, and he last used marijuana in July 2018. He described his \nusage as infrequent and occurring only when he visited states where marijuana had \nbeen decriminalized. He estimated using marijuana about two to three times while \nholding a security clearance. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant described his marijuana use as infrequent, \noccasional, and for recreational use only. Concerning the factual allegations in the SOR, \nhe admitted the following: (1) using marijuana from about April 2018 to July 2018 after \ncompleting his April 2018 security clearance application; (2) purchasing marijuana after \ncompleting his April 2018 security clearance application; (3) using marijuana with \nvarying frequency, occasionally, from about May 2015 to July 2018, while granted \naccess to classified information; (4) purchasing marijuana while granted access to \nclassified information; and (5) having an intention to use marijuana in the future, \nmeaning in the future he may continue his occasional marijuana usage. He further \nadmitted using marijuana once in 2019 and once in 2020. \nIn his reply to the FORM, Applicant did not dispute the facts, but he did dispute \nthat those facts should result in an unfavorable clearance decision. He described his \nmarijuana usage as occasional and responsible, not abusive or habitual, and equated it \nto having a couple of beers. He denied any potential for social stigma or blackmail \nbecause he has been candid about it with his friends and family. He also pointed to his \nhistory of employment in the defense industry without any security infractions or \nviolations as well as his contributions as a senior software engineer. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.6 An \nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.7 In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern as \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 is that: \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are use in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . . .  \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

It includes using marijuana after he initially went through \nthe security clearance process in 2008. It includes using marijuana after he returned to \nemployment in the defense industry in 2014. It further includes using marijuana in 2018, \n2019, and 2020. Some of his marijuana use occurred during his employment with a \nfederal contractor and while he held a security clearance. Any illegal drug use is \nrelevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s security worthiness, but it is particularly \negregious if it occurs during the course of employment while granted access to \nclassified information. Furthermore, I presume his marijuana usage was in violation of \nhis employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy.9 Simply put, a man of Applicant\u2019s age, \neducational background, and work experience should have known better than to use \nmarijuana while employed for a company doing business in the defense industry. \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation is not very strong. The one item that stands out in \nhis favor is his candour and willingness to disclose his marijuana usage in his 2018 \nsecurity clearance application and during his 2019 background investigation. The credit \nis limited, however, because he continued to use marijuana after completing the 2018 \nsecurity clearance application. \n9 ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2017) at 2 (noting the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires \nfederal contractors with a contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nI also considered the two mitigating conditions noted above, and neither applies \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. His marijuana use may be irregular or occasional, but it has \noccurred over a period of years. His usage is recent too, having occurred in 2018, 2019, \nand 2020. In addition, he has not clearly and convincingly persuaded me that he intends \nto discontinue using marijuana. Indeed, after reading his answer to the SOR and his \nreply to the FORM, I was persuaded of just the opposite. His written responses largely \nrelied on state law, which is interesting but not controlling here, and are otherwise filled \nwith rationalizations or minimizations or both.  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant graduated from high school in 1988. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1988. In November 1989, he was administratively discharged for desertion. He received an Other Than Honorable Conditions discharge. He claimed that his discharge was upgraded to a General discharge under Honorable conditions. Since 2016, he has been the owner and operator of a truck transport business. Prior to that, he was a driver for other trucking companies. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. (FORM Item 7 at 2.) SOR Allegations 1. Under Guideline F, the SOR sets forth two allegations of unpaid debts. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegations, claiming that the debts had been taken off his credit reports.

Under Guideline F, the SOR sets forth two allegations of unpaid debts. In his \nAnswer, Applicant denied the allegations, claiming that the debts had been taken off his \ncredit reports. The details regarding both debts and Applicant\u2019s responses to the \nallegations are as follows. \na. Bank Loan delinquent in the amount of $50,910 and in collection. In 2005, \nApplicant borrowed funds in connection with the purchase of a residential property. He \nsubsequently defaulted on the loan. The bank foreclosed on the property. The bank then \nreferred the residual debt to a collection agency. In his SOR answer, Applicant wrote that \nthe bank foreclosed on the defaulted loan in 2011. He commented that he defaulted on \nthe loan due to his inability to find work at that time and the housing crisis of 2008.

He believed that the bank wrote off the debt, and the account \nwas closed and taken off his credit by 2018. In fact, the debt appears on FORM Item 4, \nApplicant\u2019s August 6, 2018 credit report. The debt was reported by two credit bureaus, \nExperian and TransUnion. The debt does not appear on FORM Item 5, an August 13, \n2019 Equifax report obtained by the CAF. In his May 2019 background interview, \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator the existence of this debt in delinquent status. He \nadvised that he has no intention of paying this debt. Since then he has provided no \ndocumentary evidence or written commentary suggesting that he has paid this debt or \nentered into a payment plan to repay the debt. This debt remains unresolved. (FORM \nItem 2 at 3; Item 4 at 3; Item 5; Item 7 at 4.) \nb. Credit Union loan delinquent in the amount of $4,145 and in collection. Applicant \nis a co-obligor on this loan. The other borrower was one of his former wives. Applicant \nclaimed in his SOR answer that his ex-wife was obligated to pay this debt, though he \nprovided no explanation as to why he is not also liable on the loan as a co-maker. He \nwrote further that he has never been contacted about this account and believed the debt \nwas written off in 2018 and removed from his credit report. This debt also appears on \nFORM Item 4, as a collection account reported by Experian and TransUnion. The \nGovernment\u2019s August 13, 2019 Equifax credit report does not list this debt. In his \nbackground interview, Applicant failed to disclose this debt to the investigator. When \nconfronted with this debt, he stated that he has no intention of paying it. Since then \nApplicant has provided no documentary evidence or written commentary suggesting that \nhe has paid this debt or entered into a payment plan to repay the debt. He has also not \nprovided any documentary evidence to support his claim that this debt is solely the \nresponsibility of his ex-wife. This debt remains unresolved. (FORM Item 2 at 3; Item 4 at \n3; Item 5.) \n2. Under Guideline E, the SOR sets forth one allegation. The details of this \nallegation and Applicant\u2019s response are as follows. \na. The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to disclose the above delinquent debts in \nhis response to a question in Section 26 of his 2018 SCA asking whether he had (1) \ndefaulted on any loans in the last seven years; (2) bills turned over to collection agencies \nduring the same period; or (3) been over 120 days delinquent on any debts. Applicant \nanswered this question in the negative, which was factually incorrect. Applicant wrote in \nhis SOR answer that he denied any intent to falsify his response to the SCA question \nabout his debts. He wrote that he believed these debts had been resolved prior to the \nseven-year timeframe provided in this question. Accordingly, he argues that he did not \nintentionally omit the debts in his SCA. (FORM Item 2 at 3; Item 4 at 3; Item 5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n4 \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence establishes the following potentially disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 19: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Three of these mitigating conditions possibly \napply to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. The debts arose several years ago, but they still \nappeared as reported by Experian and TransUnion on the Government\u2019s 2018 credit \nreport in the record as unpaid and in collection. Even if the debts had dropped off the \ncredit bureaus\u2019 current credit reports, the debts remain unsatisfied in the absence of \nevidence of resolutions. In the event that the lenders charged off these debts on their \nfinancials, the debts are still outstanding and remain the legal obligations of the Applicant. \nHis refusal to honor these debts increases the likelihood that he will refuse to pay future \nfinancial obligations. Applicant\u2019s ongoing delinquencies on two loans cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. Applicant asserts that his residual \nmortgage debt arose out of lack of employment and the 2008 housing crisis, which were \ncircumstances beyond his control. He has not provided evidence, however, that he acted \nresponsibly once he recovered financially with new employment. Applicant\u2019s inability to \nnegotiate a settlement with the mortgage lender does not establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He was obligated to repay the entire debt, even if \nit had to be paid over time. As for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s \nfailure to pay the debt does not relieve him of his obligation to pay the debt. He has \nprovided no evidence as to why he did not repay this debt aside from his belief that he \nshould not have to pay the debt even though he co-signed the loan. Overall, Applicant \nsimply walked away from these debts without resolving them. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant wrote in his Answer that he does not \nbelieve he owes either of the debts alleged in the SOR. He has not provided, however, a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of these past-due debts. Moreover, he has not \nprovided any documentary evidence showing that he has disputed these debts with the \ncredit bureaus, the original creditors, or the collection agencies. He has submitted no \ncorrespondence with the mortgage lender evidencing a dispute as to whether he owes \nthis debt or an acknowledgement from the bank that he owes nothing further on the \nmortgage loan following the foreclosure on the property. Similarly, he has not submitted \nhis divorce decree reflecting that his ex-wife is solely responsible for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Both debts appear on his 2018 credit report as being reported by two credit \nbureaus. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 16 contains seven conditions that are potentially \ndisqualifying under circumstances involving personal misconduct. One of the conditions \nhas possible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThis potentially disqualifying condition requires the Government to establish that \nApplicant was aware of each of these debts in June 2018 when he signed the SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s statements in his SOR answer establish that he was aware of the existence \nof the debts during the seven years preceding his June 2018 SCA and that he deliberately \nomitted this derogatory information from his SCA. The fact that he did not believe he was \nultimately responsible for the debts does not support a conclusion that he did not \nintentionally provide false information about the existence of the debts during the \npreceding seven-year period. AG \u00b6 19(a) is established. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Two of these mitigating conditions possibly \napply to the facts of this case: \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is only partially established. In his background interview almost one \nyear after his submission of his SCA, Applicant disclosed the existence of debt 1.a. His \ndisclosure at that time was not timely. Also, Applicant failed to disclose voluntarily debt \n1.b before he was confronted with the existence of the debt. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. The falsifications are not minor.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence \nas described above leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.

Since April 2019, he has worked for \na defense contractor.

He has no interest in or intent to use drugs in the future. Applicant\u2019s \ncareer is more important to him than illegal drug use. (FORM Item 3.) \nLaw and Policies \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528,531 (1988) (\u201cit should be \nobvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of \nDefense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance). Under \nEgan, E.O. 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be \nallowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national \nsecurity.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.

ISCR \nCase No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \ndoubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25 and 26 \n(setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug \nparaphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and, \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;(2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and, \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana and cocaine with varying frequency from \nNovember 2004 to February 2019 at times while holding a security clearance. Facts \nadmitted by an applicant in an answer to a SOR or in an interview require no further proof \nfrom the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany \nadmissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of \nits burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n \napplicant\u2019s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d). \n  \nMarijuana and cocaine are Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of \nthem is regulated by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. The knowing or intentional possession and use of any controlled \nsubstance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment and or a fine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In \nan October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence reaffirmed that \nthe use of marijuana is relevant to national security determinations, regardless of changes \nto state laws concerning marijuana use. James R. Clapper, Director of National \nIntelligence, Memorandum: Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use \n(October 25, 2014). See also http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), \nand (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs with \nvarying frequency from November 2004 to February 2019 at times while holding a security \nclearance. His behavior was neither infrequent, nor did it occur long ago, with his last use \nbeing in February 2019, just over two years ago. I find that AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b). There several elements to AG \u00b6 \n26(b). First, the applicant needs to have acknowledged his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. Second, applicant needs to have signed a written statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement in the future. Here, Applicant acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement and his intent to abstain from drug involvement in the future. Those \nacknowledgements were made in written statements by Applicant in his Answer to the \nSOR, his security clearance application, and during his Personal Subject Interview (PSI), \nall of which were verified. Third, Applicant needs to acknowledge that any future drug \ninvolvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. Applicant has stated \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat his career is more important to him than illegal drug use. I find that those three \nelements of AG \u00b6 26(b) are satisfied. \nThere remains, however, two other elements of AG \u00b6 26(b). Fourth, an applicant \nmust disassociate himself from drug-using associates. During his PSI Applicant admitted \nthat he remains in contact with the two friends who enabled his use of marijuana and \ncocaine. I find that this element is not satisfied. Fifth, an overarching element is that an \napplicant has shown a pattern of abstinence. Applicant has been abstinent for just over \ntwo years, after many years of illegal drug usage. I find that this is not a sufficient pattern \nof abstinence. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. Applicant is on the right track, and if he remains \nabstinent, he could be a worthy candidate for reapplication. \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not \nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \n   Against Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:           \n \n \n Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old and works for a defense contractor as a technician. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps (1985-1989). He has married and divorced twice (1985-2014 and 2014-2019). He separated from his first wife in 2003. He and his first wife have five children. After their separation, he was the custodial parent for two of the children when they were minors. They are now 23 and 35. Applicant earned a high school diploma and has taken some college and technical school courses. He has worked in the aviation industry and specifically for defense contractors for much of his career.

On the same day, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for June 11, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, all of which were admitted without objection.

(Hearing Transcript at 14-17, 33-34.) \nI kept the record open initially until June 25, 2021, to give Applicant the opportunity \nto supplement the record. Applicant requested an extension of time, which I granted, \ngiving him until July 23, 2021. He timely submitted three additional documents, which I \nmarked as AE D through F and admitted into the record without objection.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old and works for a defense contractor as a technician. He \nserved honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps (1985-1989). He has married and divorced \ntwice (1985-2014 and 2014-2019). He separated from his first wife in 2003. He and his \nfirst wife have five children. After their separation, he was the custodial parent for two of \nthe children when they were minors. They are now 23 and 35. Applicant earned a high \nschool diploma and has taken some college and technical school courses. He has worked \nin the aviation industry and specifically for defense contractors for much of his career. \nCounting his four years in the Marine Corps and again more recently as a contractor, he \nhas held a security clearance for about eight years. He has never had a security violation. \n(Tr. at 11, 25-29; GE 2 at 11-12.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to file his federal and state income tax returns for several years and pay his federal \nand state tax liabilities dating back to 2003 and as recently as 2019. Applicant\u2019s combined \nstate and federal past-due tax liabilities total over $90,000. The SOR also alleges a 2013 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and two delinquent consumer debts totaling about $2,600. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe details regarding each SOR allegation are as follows: \nFailure to file federal income tax returns - In his Answer, Applicant admitted that \nhe failed to timely file his federal tax returns for the tax years (TY) 2010 through 2019. \n(SOR 1.k.) He reported in his answers to the Government\u2019s interrogatories that he filed \nthe returns for TY 2011 through TY 2016 on September 11, 2020, and the returns for TY \n2017 through TY 2019 on August 15, 2020. He also wrote that he was working with his \naccountant on the federal return for TY 2010. As of the close of the record, there was no \nevidence that he filed his 2010 federal tax return. The returns for the later years were filed \nbefore Applicant received the SOR in December 2020. (Tr. at 35-40; GE 2 at 2.)  \nFailure to file state income tax returns - In his Answer, Applicant admitted that \nhe failed to timely file his tax returns for State 1 for TY 2010 through TY 2016. (SOR 1.l.) \nHe also admitted that he failed to timely file his tax returns for State 2 for TY 2017 through \n2019. (SOR 1.cc.) He reported in his answers to the Government\u2019s interrogatories that \nhe filed the returns for TY 2011 through TY 2016 in State 1 on September 11, 2020, and \nthe returns for TY 2017 through TY 2019 in State 2 on August 15, 2020. Both filing dates \npredate Applicant\u2019s receipt of the SOR. He provided no evidence that he has filed his tax \nreturn in State 1 for TY 2010. Applicant testified that he should have filed his returns \nbecause he had sufficient withholding to pay his tax liability. He attested that all \nassessments by the state tax authorities were due to the states\u2019 estimating what he owed \nand penalizing him for not filing. (Tr. at 42-43; GE 2 at 4.) \nFailure to pay federal income taxes \u2013 Applicant admitted in his Answer that he \nowed the U.S. Government past-due income taxes in a total amount of about $78,000 for \nTY 2003 and TY 2004 (SOR 1.b), TY 2006 (SOR 1.d), TY 2007 (SOR 1.f), TY 2008 (SOR \n1.g), TY 2009 (SOR 1.h), TY 2011 (SOR 1.o), TY 2012 (SOR 1.q), TY 2013 (SOR 1.u), \nTY 2014 (SOR 1.w), TY 2015 (SOR 1.y), TY 2016 (SOR 1.aa), TY 2017 (SOR 1.dd), TY \n2018 (SOR 1.ff), and TY 2019 (SOR 1.hh). In his interrogatory responses, he wrote that \nhis total federal tax liability for TY 2011 through TY 2019 is $43,425. He disclosed, \nhowever, tax liabilities by each tax year during that period totaling more than $60,000.  \n \nApplicant testified that the IRS has \u201cforgiven\u201d his past-due taxes. After the hearing, \nApplicant provided a letter from the IRS, dated July 22, 2021, referencing TY 2008 and \nTY 2011 \u2013 2020. In that letter, the IRS informed Applicant that it was closing its case for \nthe collection of Applicant\u2019s tax liabilities for the referenced years as \u201cCurrently Not \nCollectible.\u201d The IRS noted further the Applicant \u201cstill owe[d] $94,168.43 to the IRS for the \n[referenced] tax periods.\u201d The letter further noted that this tax liability will continue to \naccrue penalties and interest, and the collection case is subject to reopening if Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cfinancial situation improves in the future.\u201d The IRS also advised Applicant that it will file \na Notice of Federal T\n ax Lien to protect the Government\u2019s interest. (Tr. at 38-41; GE 2 at \n2, 3; AE E.) \nFailure to pay state income and sales taxes \u2013 Applicant admitted in his Answer \nthat he owed past-due income taxes to State 1 for TY 2006 (SOR 1.e), TY 2009 (SOR \n1.i), TY 2011 (SOR 1.p), TY 2012 (SOR 1.r), TY 2013 (SOR 1.v), TY 2014 (SOR 1.x), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nTY 2015 (SOR 1.z), and TY 2016 (SOR 1.bb). He also admitted that he owed State 1 \nsales tax for TY 2009 (SOR 1.j) and that State 1 filed two tax liens against him in 2011 \n(SOR 1.m and 1.n) and a wage garnishment in 2013 (SOR 1.t). In addition, he admitted \nin his Answer that he owed taxes to State 2 for TY 2003 (specifically, a State 2 county \ntax) (SOR 1.a), TY 2017 (State 2 income tax) (SOR 1.ee), and TY 2018 (State 2 income \ntax) (SOR 1.gg). He also admitted that State 2 filed a tax lien against him in 2006 (SOR \n1.c). His state tax delinquencies, as alleged in the SOR and admitted in  his Answer, total \nabout $18,000. In his interrogatory responses, he advised that his  total tax liability to \nStates 1 and 2 was $6,782. Applicant testified that he had entered into an installment \npayment plan with State 1 to pay it $40 per month until his tax liability is paid off.  \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a letter from the tax collection department \nof State 1, dated June 21, 2021, acknowledging receipt of his application for an \u201cOffer in \nCompromise.\u201d The state agency wrote that it would inform Applicant if his settlement offer \nwas accepted \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Applicant testified that State 2 has forgiven his tax \nliabilities based upon his current finances. However, he submitted after the hearing an \ninstallment agreement, dated July 6, 2021, that he entered into with State 2 to pay $40 \nper month, which reflects that State 2 is requiring Applicant to begin to pay his delinquent \ntax liability. (Tr. at 38-41, 43-44, 59; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 4-6; AE A; AE D.) \n2013 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \u2013 Applicant admitted in his Answer that in January \n2013 he filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and that he was granted a \ndischarge of his debts in May 2013. (SOR 1.s.) In his petition, he listed 43 unsecured \nnon-priority debts totaling about $32,000 that were subsequently discharged. He testified \nthat he incurred these debts \u201cto keep my family alive.\u201d He also listed unsecured priority \ntax debts owed to the IRS in the total amount of about $30,000 for TYs 2003, 2004, and \n2006-2009 and debts owed to State 1 for delinquent income taxes in TYs 2006 and 2009 \nand a delinquent sales tax debt in TY 2009 arising from his purchase of a vehicle in \nanother state. The total amount of the debts listed as owed to State 1 was about $12,000. \nLastly, he listed a State 2 county tax debt for TY 2003, which he incurred when he \npreviously lived in State 2. None of the unsecured priority tax debts were discharged in \nthe bankruptcy proceeding. (Tr. at 47-48; GE 3 at 23-32, 60.) \nDelinquent debts in collection \u2013 Applicant admitted in his Answer two debts that \nwere placed for collection. (SOR 1.ii and 1.jj.) He commented further that the debts were \n\u201cincurred by\u201d or \u201cbelongs to\u201d his ex-wife. He also wrote that they were included in his 2013 \nbankruptcy. Neither the creditors nor the debts, however, are listed in his bankruptcy \npetition. Applicant provided no evidence that linked either of the two debts to any of the \ndebts listed in his bankruptcy petition. According to the Government\u2019s evidence, the debt \nalleged in SOR 1.ii for $1,008 is owed to a former landlord in State 1 and arises from a \nlease default in about 2014. Applicant testified that he had a dispute with the landlord \nabout an infestation of roaches in the apartment. The debt alleged in SOR 1.jj for $1,622 \nwas a credit-card account owed to a bank before it was referred to a collection agency. \nApplicant defaulted on the debt in about 2018. He testified that the credit card belonged \nto his ex-wife. Neither debt has been resolved.

He explained that his actions were simply the result of his \ndifficult circumstances. Applicant felt that his obligations as a father of five children had \nto take precedence over certain other obligations. His service with the Marine Corps gave \nhim a sense of duty and honor. His duties to his family and his country have always been \nimportant to him. He believes he has provided \u201cunwavering devotion regardless of \npersonal sacrifice \u201c to both. Beginning in 2003 when his children were young and his first \nwife left him, he has struggled to support himself and the two children for whom he was \nthe custodial parent as well as his three other children who lived with his wife. He worked \nin State 1 in low-wage positions below his skill level. He was required to move frequently \nfor different jobs. (Tr. at 11-12, 30-32, 40-45; AE C.) \nSince his return to State 2 in 2017, he has begun the \u201cprocess of becoming whole \nagain.\u201d He has worked for his current employer, a major defense contractor, since \nJanuary 2019. He has now filed his tax returns, including his 2020 returns, and is \nbeginning to make payment arrangements to pay his delinquent taxes to States 1 and 2. \nHe owes the IRS an additional $2,000 for 2020, but he claims that has been \u201cforgiven\u201d as \nwell. As noted above, the IRS is simply not seeking to collect Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes \nat this time. \nFor TY 2020, Applicant was entitled to a tax refund from State 2, where he \npresently works and resides, but the state is retaining the funds to apply against his \ndelinquent taxes. Applicant intends to continue filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns in a timely manner in the future. Applicant failed to provide any significant reasons \nfor his failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns for many years other than the \nfact that he was overwhelmed with his difficult circumstances. (Tr. at 11-12, 30-32, 40-45; \nAE C.) \nApplicant\u2019s current net pay is about $3,400 per month. His monthly rent is $1,695. \nHe drives a 2017 Jaguar, which he testified he recently bought used for $19,000. His \nmonthly car payment is $480. The Government\u2019s March 23, 2021, credit report in the \nrecord (GE 7) reflects that on July 30, 2020, Applicant opened a car loan account with a \nhigh credit amount of $26,912. His monthly payment on this account is $488. After paying \nhis rent and car note, he is left with about $1,200 to pay his remaining expenses, including \nhis tax installment payments to States 1 and 2. Applicant asserted in a written statement \nthat he received financial counseling online and through his employer, but this is \notherwise undocumented. He notes that with this counseling has become a \u201cresponsible \ncredit card holder in good standing.\u201d GE 7 lists four active credit cards.

(AE B-1 and B-2.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and testimony establish the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Five of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax debts and failures to timely file his \nfederal and state tax returns are numerous, extensive, long-term, and ongoing. In the \nabsence of a recent track record of timely filings of tax returns and payments on his \ndelinquent taxes, his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose in part \nout of his personal circumstances during the period after his separation from his first wife \nin 2003. He began accruing tax debts in the subsequent years and did not act responsibly \nby developing a plan to avoid future tax indebtedness. He also did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances by failing to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nfor many years up until 2019. He did not provide an adequate reason to justify his failure \nto file his tax returns for many years as required. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Applicant claimed that he received credit \ncounseling online, which may have been in connection with his 2013 bankruptcy. He \nprovided no details about that counseling. He also asserts that he received financial \ncounseling through his employer, though he again provided no details or documentation \nto evidence the extent of the counseling.

The second prong of this \nmitigating condition, however, has not been established. Applicant does not have a track \nrecord of making payments on his installment payment plans with States 1 and 2. \nAccordingly, his evidence has not provided clear indications that his state tax problems \nare resolved or are under control. His inability to pay his past-due federal tax debts is also \nevidence that his federal taxes are not resolved. The IRS wrote of its intention to file a tax \nlien against Applicant in an amount in excess of $94,000, which will render this tax liability \nas a problem for Applicant for years to come. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. Applicant has very recently initiated an \neffort to repay his delinquent state taxes. His actions, however, are too late to be properly \ndescribed as made in good faith. Also, he has not provided evidence of payments under \nhis installment payment plans with State 1 and 2. As of the close of the record, the \nevidence does not even establish that his Offer in Compromise made to State 1 has been \naccepted. With respect to his federal tax delinquency of over $94,000, Applicant\u2019s \nevidence that the IRS is not presently seeking payment due to Applicant\u2019s inability to pay \ndoes not mitigate his past actions just as the non-collectability of a consumer debt due to \nthe application of a statute of limitations does not mitigate security concerns arising from \nthe existence of an unpaid debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is only partially established. Applicant has filed his federal and state \ntax returns for TYs 2011 and later, including 2020. He has not, however, filed his 2010 \nfederal tax return. With respect to the taxes, penalties and interest he owes to State 2, he \nhas entered into an installment payment plan to pay the state $40 per month. He has \nmade an Offer in Compromise to State 1 to begin paying his tax debt to that state. As of \nthe close of the record, there was no evidence that State 1 had accepted Applicant\u2019s Offer \nin Compromise. Since both payment plans are recent, there is no evidence in the record \nto show that he has begun to comply with either payment plan, let alone to establish that \nhe is in compliance with those arrangements. The fact that the IRS has determined that \nApplicant is unable to repay his large tax debt to the Federal Government and is not \nseeking payment at this time does not mitigate the security concerns raised by his past \nbehavior. The inability to pay a debt is one of the disqualifying conditions under Guideline \nF. (AG \u00b6 19(a).)   \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \ndetermination and commitment to resolve his tax problems to the best of his ability to do \nso. He is a proud veteran of the Marine Corps and takes great pride in performing his \ncurrent job in support of the U.S. military, which he has trained to do all his adult life. I \nhave given weight to his military service and to the sincere and impressive testimony of \nhis character witness. I have also weighed the difficult circumstances Applicant has faced \nfor many years trying to support and raise his children to the best of his ability to do so. \nHe was always there for his children. \nThe choice Applicant made, however, of putting his tax filing and payment \nobligations to the side for so many years presents security concerns under the \nAdjudicative Guidelines that he has not been able to mitigate. He did file his outstanding \ntax returns before he received the SOR, which evidences his sincerity to begin resolving \nhis tax issues. However, he never had a plan to begin paying his delinquent federal taxes, \nstarting by paying all his 2020 taxes. His $2,000 of unpaid federal taxes in 2020 evidences \nthat he did not withhold enough taxes from his paychecks and that future tax deficiencies \nare likely. At the same time, he prioritized the purchase in mid-2020 of a relatively \nexpensive, luxury vehicle. Repaying the money he borrowed to purchase that car will \nconsume a significant amount of his monthly income for years to come. Also, he initiated \nhis plans to pay his state tax debts too late to begin to establish a track record of \ncompliance with his installment payment plans. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.jj: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on June 8, 2021. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant asked to leave the record open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with the documenting of his \nsatisfaction of his home equity loan (covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a), and whether the loan that \nwas foreclosed is covered by any state anti-deficiency statute. \nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record. \nDepartment Counsel was afforded seven days to respond. Applicant did not supplement \nthe record. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated two delinquent debts: one \nfor an unsatisfied $75,552 equity deficiency on his foreclosed home equity loan and \nanother for a delinquent medical debt of $271. Allegedly, these debts remain unsatisfied \nand outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant disputed the existence of a deficiency \nbalance following the foreclosure of his home equity loan but admitted the allegation \npertaining to a delinquent medical debt with explanations. He claimed this debt \nrepresents a dental debt arising out of his son\u2019s dentistry visit and is the result of a \nmiscommunication between himself and son as to whether the dental bill was paid. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 51 year-old system administrator data for a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as \nrelevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in April 1999, separated in August 2017, and divorced in April \n2021. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 25-26, 29) He has no children from this marriage. He earned an \nAssociate\u2019s degree in October 1991 and reported no military service. (GE 1) \nSince May 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nsystem administrator.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n                                                  \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

Uncertain is the sale \nprice of the underlying property at the scheduled public sale and whether the sale \nproduced enough excess proceeds to cover the second mortgagee\u2019s (SOR 1.a) security \ninterest in Applicant\u2019s home equity loan. Resolved by payment is the $271 debt covered \nby SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant\u2019s incurring of a delinquent home equity loan secured by the creditor\u2019s \nsecond mortgage interest in the property warrants the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nEach of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies. \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

In such circumstances, the creditor\u2019s \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) only enforcement option as a sold-out junior lien holder would be its \nobtaining a personal judgment against Applicant for the deficiency following the first \nmortgagee\u2019s foreclosure of its first mortgage and application of the ensuing sale \nproceeds to satisfy its first mortgage only. \n \nConceivably, the sale of Applicant\u2019s foreclosed residence produced enough \nexcess sale proceeds after satisfying the first mortgagee\u2019s loan interest to cover all or a \npart of the SOR creditor 1.a\u2019s subordinate interest in the property. Without any more \ndefinitive post-hearing information from Applicant on the sale and availability (if any) of \nexcess sale proceeds to cover all or a part of SOR creditor 1.a\u2019s interest in the property, \nthe Government is entitled to rely on information contained in credit reports addressing \nApplicant\u2019s mortgages to assess the current debt status of Applicant\u2019s home equity loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) (GE.s 4-5), Although, the information contained in Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nIs open to challenge for accuracy by evidence of rebuttal, mitigation, or explanation. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08925 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2008). \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to provide more clarifying information on the \ncurrent status of his home equity loan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a, neither MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency \na death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is entitled \nto only partial application attributable to his wife\u2019s health issues covering the years \n2012-2016. \nSimilarly, MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is entitled to no more than \nnominal application to Applicant\u2019s situation. To date, Applicant is able to cite to only \nother non-SOR debts reported to be in good standing in his credit reports and his payoff \nof the $271 medical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b as examples of good-faith payment \ninitiatives. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s produced credit reports are conflicting on the issue of \nApplicant\u2019s liability exposure to SOR creditor \u00b6 1.a. While the earlier 2019-2020 creditor \nreports produced by the Government confirm the existing liability of Applicant to SOR \ncreditor 1.a, the mortgage debt was no longer reported in Applicant\u2019s more recent 2021 \ncredit report. Deletion of the debt could indicate satisfaction of the debt, or it could \nsignify simply that the debt has been removed from coverage because the debt is no \nlonger enforceable. For written contracts (inclusive of mortgage instruments), the \ncontrolling statute of limitations bar in Applicant\u2019s state of residence is three years. See \n\u00a7 5-101 of M stats. Because the foreclosure sale was completed in 2016, application of \nthe state\u2019s three-year statute of limitations bar might well explain the deletion of the \nSOR \u00a7 1.a debt from Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit report.

Debts reduced \ninvoluntarily by the passage of time have never been equated by the Appeal Board with \ngood-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 (App. \nBd. July 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-3030 at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001) \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts (and implicitly the timely filing of tax returns, as \nrequired). See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). In Applicant\u2019s \ncase, his failures to provide more information on the status of his delinquent home \nequity loan and steps he has taken to address and resolve the debt detailed in his credit \nreports, preclude him from taking full advantage of potentially available mitigating \nconditions. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his overall management of his finances are compatible with \nminimum standards for holding a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit \nfor both his civilian contributions and his payment satisfaction of his SOR \u00b6 1.b medical \ndebt, neither his civilian contributions nor his modest efforts in addressing his listed \nSOR debts are enough to mitigate raised financial concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s past and present failures to address and resolve his debt \ndelinquencies reflect adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently \nstable manner to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. At \nthis time, it is too soon to make safe predictions of his stabilizing his finances within the \nforeseeable future. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 13, 2019 (2019 SCA). \nOn October 28, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines M and E. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 28, 2020, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 22, 2020, the Government \nsent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 8.

Items 3 through 8 are admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer included evidentiary documents that I admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. Item 6 was not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection \nto Item 6. The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant \nof his right to object to the admissibility of Item 6 on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise an objection to Item 6 in \nhis response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered \nto have waived any such objection, and that Item 6 could be considered as evidence in \nhis case. Applicant did not object to Item 6 in his FORM response or otherwise. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 34, is married with four minor children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2012. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2019. He was previously granted security clearances in 2012 and 2016. (Item 5) \nThe SOR alleged facts regarding misconduct that resulted in Applicant being \nterminated by Employer 1 in 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a.) and by Employer 2 in 2018 (SOR \n\u00b6 2.b). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each allegation and proffered mitigating \nevidence. Despite his admission and references to being terminated by Employer 1 \nthroughout the security clearance process, I have construed his 2015 termination as a \n\u201cresignation in lieu of termination\u201d to conform to the record evidence, an official business \nrecord stating same. (Item 2; Item 7 at 29) \nApplicant worked for Employer 1, as a government contractor, for three years until \nhe resigned in lieu of being terminated for cause in October 2015 after violating company \npolicies relating to computer misuse and labor mischarging. He misused his company-\nissued computer by accessing sexually explicit materials. He mischarged labor hours to \nthe U.S. government for time that he was actively engaged in excessive personal use on \nhis company-issued computer. These incidents occurred while Applicant was at his \nworkplace during the workday. (AE A; Item 7 at 29; Items 5, 8) \nA coworker, who observed Applicant viewing nude images on two occasions, \nreported both incidents to Applicant\u2019s supervisor. Following the initial incident in June \n2015, the supervisor counseled Applicant about the appropriate use of company assets \nand labor charging. The supervisor assumed Applicant had corrected the behavior until \nhe was notified of the second incident in August 2015, at which time Employer 1 initiated \nan investigation, including active desktop monitoring (ADM) for a period of nine days. \n(Items 5, 8) \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe investigation confirmed the August 2015 incident. The ADM revealed that  \nApplicant: 1) accessed nude and/or sexually explicit images on seven of the nine days; \n2) was actively engaged in an excessive amount of other non-work web activity over nine \ndays; and 3) took deliberate actions to conceal his internet searches and other web \nactivity. Employer 1 concluded that Applicant mischarged roughly 42% of his time, which \nequated to 158 hours between the date the allegations were first reported and his last \nday of employment. His mischarging, which resulted in a loss of approximately $13,874, \nincluded the time he spent on viewing sexually explicit materials and other non-work web \nactivity on his company-issued computer. (AE B; Item 7 at 13-30; Item 8) \nApplicant knew at the time he was accessing sexually explicit materials that it was \nagainst company policy. He initially denied that he mischarged his labor hours believing \nthat the time he spent on non-work activity was acceptable because it occurred during \nwhat he considered downtime. However, he eventually acknowledged that he was \nmistaken in that belief, accepted responsibility for his actions, and recognized the \nseriousness of his misconduct. (FORM Response; Item 8 at 7) \nApplicant attributed his 2015 misconduct to an addiction he had to pornography \nand sexually explicit materials since he was a teenager. He resorted to it as a \u201cmental \nescape\u201d when faced with challenges at home or work. He had been in denial that he had \na problem until he was faced with termination. He has since sought and received \ncounseling on a regular basis, and developed strategies to help him to overcome his \naddiction and prevent relapse. He increased his involvement in serving his community. In \nAugust 2017, Applicant\u2019s counselor expressed his belief that Applicant would make a full \nrecovery. (AE B; Item 2; Item 7 at 7, 29-30; Item 8 at 11-13; FORM Response) \nIn July 2017, the Department of the Navy notified Applicant of his proposed \ndebarment on the basis of his significant mischarging in 2015. In September 2017, \nApplicant successfully appealed the debarment. The SDO (Suspending and Debarring \nOfficial) concluded that Applicant appreciated the gravity of the misconduct that formed \nthe basis of the proposed debarment, and took steps to correct his behavior to ensure \nappropriate future conduct. The SDO believed that Applicant no longer presented a threat \nto the integrity of the government procurement process. (AE B; Item 7 at 13-30) \nApplicant worked for Employer 2 for 23 months until he was terminated for cause \nin February 2018, during his probationary period, after his performance and conduct were \ndeemed unacceptable. The following summarized the incidents upon which his \ntermination was based: 1) continuously demonstrated a lack of teamwork and cooperation \nwith his coworkers; 2) continuously engaged in an argumentative and discourteous \nmanner toward others; 3) routinely made decisions on issues that he was unwilling to \ndiscuss when there were differences in opinion; and 4) unwilling to be collaborative, which \nnegatively impacted productivity and the mission. (Item 7 at 31-49) \nIn February 2018, Applicant received a notice outlining the basis of his termination, \nincluding the specific incidents noted above. He was informed of his right to grieve the \naction, of which he timely availed himself.

(Item 7 at 44-49) \nApplicant attributed his 2018 termination to his inability to effectively communicate. \nHe denied any malicious intent and expressed regret for having never been given the \nopportunity to explain himself before being terminated. He has since received counsel \nfrom his spouse and friends to better understand more effective ways of interacting with \ncoworkers. He has learned to be a better coworker, sought to listen and follow more, and \nshow more trust and patience with his chain of command. He has implemented \ntechniques to help him to be a better employee. He asserted that his current employer \nhas recognized his growth as an employee. (AE C; Item 2 at 3; Item 7 at 9, 30; FORM \nresponse) \nThroughout the security clearance process, Applicant equivocated the derogatory \ndetails surrounding his 2015 misconduct. He omitted the fact that he viewed sexually \nexplicit materials and mischarged labor when reporting the 2015 termination on his \nFebruary 2016 Declaration for Federal Employment, March 2016 SCA, and during his \nMay 2016 security clearance interview. On his May 2019 SCA, he disclosed that he \nviewed \u201cexplicit material,\u201d but not that he mischarged time; only that it was reported as \nsuch. During his July 2019 security clearance interview, he stated that he was terminated \nfor mischarging time and that \u201cpornography was found on his work computer.\u201d After being \nconfronted during his December 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had not gone into \u201cextensive detail\u201d about the actual reasons for \nhis 2015 termination \u201cdue to the embarrassing nature of situation.\u201d He also claimed that \nhe did not recall the specific details involved. (Items 3-6; Item 7 at 5, 9) \nApplicant understated the reasons for his 2018 termination on his May 2019 SCA \nand during his July 2019 interview. When explaining the reason for his termination on the \nSCA, he stated: \u201cSupervisor suggested that I [was] not a good fit for position . . . it was \nreported that I did not fit the temporary assignment and tasks at hand.\u201d During the \ninterview, he asserted that he was unsure why he was terminated beyond being told by \nhis supervisor that that he was simply not a good fit. While he claimed that he did not \nrecall the official reason given to him for his termination, he asserted that it was not due \nto any fault of his own. After being confronted during his December 2019 security \nclearance interview, Applicant claimed that he listed what he believed to be the official \nreason for the termination. He asserted that he did not list \u201call the specific details due to \nnot knowing an official reason.\u201d (Item 5 at 18; Item 7 at 4-5, 7) \nIn his FORM response, Applicant expressed remorse for what he described as \nmiscommunicating the severity of the circumstances surrounding his 2015 misconduct. \nHe stated that he was \u201cnot proud of this choice/issue,\u201d and admitted: \nI was afraid. Each time I discussed this incident I felt I could never grow \nbeyond it.

In support of mitigation, Applicant stated: \nMy spouse, current management, and religious leaders are aware of these \nsituations and have helped me be a better person. They stand as a help to \nme against exploitation, manipulation, and duress anyone would attempt to \ndo to get me to act contrary to complete loyalty to the United States \nGovernment and her mission. As each day goes by, I remember my lack of \ncandor and lack of obedience[.] I work each day to be better. I do not dismiss \nthe actions I did. Each day I try to be better.  \nBetween 2016 and 2020 Applicant satisfactorily completed approximately 15 \ntrainings, which included the topics of ethics, security, and integrity. (AE C). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 40(e): unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \nAG \u00b6 40(g): negligence or lax security practices in handling information \ntechnology that persists despite counseling by management. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOf the conditions that could mitigate the concern under this guideline, the following \nis potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 41(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant knew he was violating company policy when he accessed sexually \nexplicit materials on his company-issued computer while at his workplace during the \nworkday. He accessed those materials on a regular basis, including after being counseled \nby his supervisor. He was actively engaged in excessive personal use on his company-\nissued computer, which he deliberately acted to conceal. While these were serious \noffenses, they occurred over five years ago and are not likely to recur. However, AG \u00b6 41 \n(a) is not established because his repeated and recent efforts to obscure the derogatory \ndetails of his 2015 misconduct out of fear and embarrassment continues to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. To the extent that his \ncounseling has helped him overcome his admitted addiction to pornography, his lack of \ncandor about his misconduct undermines mitigation of his misuse of information \ntechnology. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline, as set out in AG \u00b6 15, includes: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the general \nconcerns involving questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations and the following specific disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes : (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; . . . . \nOf the conditions that could mitigate the concern under this guideline, the following \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 misconduct was serious and is also disqualifying under this \nguideline. While the specific behaviors underlying Applicant\u2019s 2018 termination were less \nserious by comparison, they denote an ongoing pattern of questionable judgment and \ninappropriate behavior that further exacerbates the concern. Applicant damaged his \ncredibility, during his December 2019 interview, when he claimed not to know the \u201cspecific \ndetails\u201d of his 2015 misconduct or the \u201cofficial reason\u201d for his 2018 termination. He would \nhave been well aware of the details during his 2017 debarment appeal. Similarly, in 2018, \nhe not only was provided with an official notice detailing the reasons but also participated \nin the grievance process. His professed remorse for his actions and rehabilitation appear \nsincere. However, his repeated and recent efforts to minimize and obscure the derogatory \ndetails of the facts and circumstances underlying his 2015 resignation and 2018 \ntermination during the security clearance process diminished the weight of the evidence \nof reform. Applicant failed to demonstrate a sufficient pattern of responsible behavior. In \nlight of these circumstances, I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s questionable \njudgment and rules violations are unlikely to recur. I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 fully apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines M and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines M and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns \ninvolving his use of information technology and his personal conduct. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Under section 23 entitled \u201cIllegal \nUse of Drugs or Drug Activity\u201d she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking whether she had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances within the last seven years.

(Tr. 31-33; GE 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October 2019 background interview, she was asked by an \ninvestigator if she had used any illegal drugs, and she replied that she had not. Then the \ninvestigator stated; \u201cIncluding marijuana?\u201d At that moment, she realized that the SCA \nquestion encompassed all drugs, including marijuana. In her state of residence, marijuana \nuse is legal only if an individual is prescribed marijuana to treat a medical condition. \nApplicant acknowledged that recreational use of marijuana in her state is not legal and \nthat all of her possessions of marijuana before using it were considered illegal. She \nanswered the investigator\u2019s follow-up question by disclosing her use of marijuana on two \noccasions. When asked about her future intentions of using illegal marijuana, Applicant \nstated that if her employer does not conduct random drug tests, she might smoke \nmarijuana in the future. However, if her employer does conduct random drug tests, then \nshe would not use marijuana in the future. During the hearing she also admitted that she \nused marijuana once or twice in late 2019 after the background interview was conducted. \nShe now has no intention of using marijuana in the future. (Tr. 25-26, 31, 37-40; GE 2) \nDuring the hearing Applicant admitted that her fianc\u00e9 currently uses marijuana \napproximately four times a year. He lives with Applicant and occasionally uses marijuana \nin front of her. She also testified that some of her family members currently use marijuana. \nShe stated that she made it clear to everyone that she has no interest in smoking or \ningesting marijuana ever again, and they respect her wishes in this matter. (Tr. 41-43) \nApplicant\u2019s current manager provided a character reference letter. He has \nobserved her work for just over a year and finds Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, and \na talented employee. Another co-worker and Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 also provided character \nreference letters. Both of these individuals described Applicant as honest, accountable \nand morally conscientious. They believe she should be granted a DOD security \nclearance. The last document submitted by Applicant is an undated employee award \npresented to her for her outstanding work contributions. (Tr. AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and AG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about 2018 to late 2019. \nShe stated during her October 2019 background interview that she would continue to use \nmarijuana in the future as long as her employer does not conduct random drug testing. \nShe continued to use marijuana on one or two occasions after her background interview \nwas conducted. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 2018 to at least late 2019. \nShe admitted that her possession of marijuana before using it was illegal in her state. She \ndid not provide any information about her illegal drug use on her August 2019 SCA \nbecause she thought it pertained to illegal \u201chard\u201d drugs. She claimed that she only realized \nthat her illegal use of marijuana was supposed to be included on the SCA during her \nbackground interview in October 2019. It was also at this time she comprehended that \nusing any illegal substance, to include marijuana, was a security concern to the federal \ngovernment. Despite this awareness, she reported to the investigator that she would \ncontinue to use marijuana in the future if her employer did not conduct random drug \ntesting. Applicant also continued to use marijuana on one or two occasions after her \ninterview was conducted, and during the course of her on-going security clearance \ninvestigation. This conduct shows poor judgment and casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that her live-in fianc\u00e9 is a current user of marijuana, and the \npossession of marijuana for recreational use is illegal in their state. She also admitted \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthat on occasion he uses marijuana in her presence. She also has other family members \nwho currently use marijuana. Applicant stated that she has abstained from using \nmarijuana since late 2019. I find that under the circumstances, it is too soon to determine \nwhether Applicant is committed to a lifestyle without the recreational use of marijuana. \nHer last use of marijuana was less than two years ago, and she has not disassociated \nwith close individuals who continue to use marijuana. More time is needed to establish \nher newfound commitment and rehabilitation. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b) does not \napply. None of the mitigating conditions apply and security concerns pertaining to drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .\u201d \nThe SCA in evidence supports the security concern addressed above. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts: and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant omitted information about her illegal use of marijuana on her August \n2019 SCA. She denied that her failure to disclose her recent marijuana use was made \nwith an intent to conceal or deceive. She stated she misread the question as pertaining \nto disclosure of \u201chard\u201d drugs only. Her explanation is not credible. During the hearing \nApplicant admitted she was aware that her possession of marijuana for recreational use \nwas illegal in her state. She is college educated, and the SCA question is clear and \nunambiguous - within the last seven years had she illegally used any drug or controlled \nsubstances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, snorting, inhaling, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \nswallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled \nsubstance. (Emphasis added) Applicant answered this question \u201cNo.\u201d \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October 2019 background interview, she reported to the \ninvestigator that she had used marijuana on two occasions. Although this may be \nconstrued as a prompt, good-faith effort by Applicant to correct her previous omission, \nthe mitigating condition is undermined by her inconsistent accounts of her history of \nmarijuana involvement. During the hearing, she admitted consuming marijuana edibles \non two occasions and smoking marijuana on five or six occasions up to the time she was \ninterviewed by the DOD authorized investigator. This significant inconsistency is \ntroubling. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and Guideline E and the AG \u00b6 2(d) \nfactors in this whole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his or her off-duty conduct or \ncircumstances can have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the \napplicant's national security eligibility. \nTo her credit, Applicant made positive changes in her life, which are supported by \nher character reference letters. She is considered a talented employee. I find that she is \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyoung and her marijuana involvement may be attributed to, at least in part, to immaturity, \nand more time is needed to establish her commitment to remaining drug-free. She lives \nwith her fianc\u00e9 who continues to use marijuana, and at times, in her presence. This \ndifficult situation makes her future use of marijuana more likely to recur. Most concerning, \nhowever, was Applicant\u2019s awareness and understanding of the government\u2019s concern \nabout her illegal use of marijuana and then using marijuana on one or two more occasions \nwhile her security clearance investigation was on-going. After evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old configuration management specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant has never married or entered into a legally recognized domestic partnership and has no children. (GEs 1-2 and 4) She earned a high school diploma in May 2001 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2005. (GEs 1-2 and AE K) She reported no military service. 2 Since May 2019, Applicant has been employed by her current defense contractor. (Item 3) Previously, she worked for other defense contractors in various jobs. (GEs 1-2 and 4 and AE K) She reported unemployment between March 2019 and May 2019 following her termination for a cited positive drug test in March 2019. (GES 1 and 5) Other reported periods of unemployment by Applicant occurred between February 2005 and May 2005 and between August 2001 and October 2001.

The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2021. A hearing was scheduled \nfor April 5, 2021, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s \ncase consisted of five exhibits. Applicant relied on three witnesses (including herself) \nand 13 exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 30, 2021. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used cocaine in at least March 2019, \nwhile holding a security clearance. The allegations are incorporated under Guideline E. \nAdditional allegations are made under Guideline E. Allegedly, Applicant was \ncharged with two driving under the influence DUI) offenses between 2007 and 2012: \none in July 2007, for which he received probation before judgment and (b) another in \nMarch 2012, in which she was convicted and sentenced to 15 days detention and two \nyears probation. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations under each \nof the cited SOR guidelines with explanations and clarifications. She claimed her cited \nuse of cocaine in March 2019 was an isolated one-time incident that she never \npreviously engaged in (not being a drug user) and will not repeat in the future (citing the \nnegative results of a recent drug test). She claimed she has cut ties with the \nacquaintance who gave her the cocaine and maintains no contact with this person. \nApplicant claimed her DUI offenses occurred in 2007 and 2012 under unusual \ncircumstances. Addressing her 2007 DUI incident, she claimed it followed the passing \nof her grandmother. Covering her 2012 DUI incident, she claimed it was the result of a \npoor decision to drive after celebrating a St. Patrick\u2019s Day gathering. Applicant further \nclaimed that she learned lessons from her DUI offenses and has taken her professional \ntraining very seriously. To support her claims, she cited her successful completion of 29 \ncourses, classes, and training sessions which she claimed to represent positive steps \ntaken to ensure that she remains a trustworthy and reliable contributor to the success of \nher assigned U.S. Army mission. She identified mitigating conditions relevant to her \nsituation a valuable contributor to her defense contractor employer and the U.S. Army. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old configuration management specialist for a defense \ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated \nand adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never married or entered into a legally recognized domestic \npartnership and has no children. (GEs 1-2 and 4) She earned a high school diploma in \nMay 2001 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2005.

(Item 3) Previously, she worked for other defense contractors in various \njobs. (GEs 1-2 and 4 and AE K) She reported unemployment between March 2019 and \nMay 2019 following her termination for a cited positive drug test in March 2019. (GES 1 \nand 5) Other reported periods of unemployment by Applicant occurred between \nFebruary 2005 and May 2005 and between August 2001 and October 2001. She held a \nsecurity clearance between November 2012 and March 2019. (GEs 1 and 5; Tr. 69-70) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nOn a Sunday afternoon In March 2019, Applicant spent the afternoon at her \nhome with a male friend venting about events that were causing her emotional grief and \ndistress: a recent breakup with her boyfriend and a large water break at her new \ntownhouse residence that caused major damage and substantial repair costs. (GE 4; Tr. \n31-32, 72-74, 76-77) This friend was not a coworker but a contractor at her work site \nwho would infrequently interact with her contractor friend over a three-month period. (Tr. \n72) \nFeeling drained and without much energy, she turned to her contractor friend for \nemotional support and assistance in painting her damaged townhouse. (Tr. 33-34, 73) \nThis friend offered her cocaine to relieve her stress. (GE 4; Tr., at 72-73) At the time, \nApplicant was aware that her contractor friend was a cocaine user. (Tr. 34, 74) Shocked \nto see this friend produce two lines of cocaine in her presence, she accepted the lines \noffered her by her friend and felt immediate remorse. (GE 4; Tr. 34, 74-75) Both \nApplicant and her friend were sober in their moment of shared cocaine use. (Tr. 73-76) \nWith a security clearance she possessed since 2012, Applicant was intimately \nfamiliar with the anti-drug policies in place with her employer and the DoD and the likely \nloss of both her job and security clearance in the event of a positive drug test. (GE 4; Tr. \n69-71) Before accepting cocaine from her friend in March 2019, Applicant had never \nused any illegal drugs while holding a security clearance that was first issued in 2012. \n(Tr. 36, 75) \nWaking up the next morning (a Monday in March 2019), and feeling the effects of \nher cocaine use the previous day, Applicant went to work. (Tr. 34-35, 72) With an \nopportunity to self-report her cocaine use incident to her facility clearance officer (FSO) \nwhen she arrived at work that day, she declined to do so, citing concerns about her \nsecurity clearance and employer\u2019s termination policy covering illegal drug use. (GE 4; \nTr. 35-36, 70-71, 77-78) Applicant acknowledged her employer\u2019s self-reporting \nrequirement and expressed regret for not self-reporting the incident to her FSO before \nbeing referred to drug testing. (Tr. 70-71) \nFearing the moment of accountability with her employer, Applicant waivered over \nself-reporting her cocaine use to her supervisor or (FSO) and ultimately demurred. By \nfailing to promptly self-report her cocaine use with the first opportunity available to her \nwhen she reported for work on the Monday following her acceptance of cocaine, she \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmissed a sizable opportunity to openly account for her judgment lapse and reinforce her \nunderstanding and appreciation of her employer\u2019s anti-drug policy. Failing to promptly \nself-report her cocaine use incident, she opened herself to candor and credibility \nchallenges about her access to and use of illegal drugs in general. \nWhile offloading a flatbed at work the following Tuesday (in March 2021), \nApplicant chose the wrong forklift for unloading, and her load fell off the forklift. (GE 4; \nTr. 35, 77) Applicant promptly reported her forklift accident to her supervisor knowing \nshe would be referred for drug testing in accordance with her employer\u2019s accident \nprotocols. (GE 4; Tr. 35-36, 70-71) \nOnce Applicant reported her forklift accident, her supervisor referred her to the \nexpected drug testing Applicant anticipated. Once faced with an involuntary drug test, \nApplicant volunteered to the testing official prior to submitting to a drug test that she \ncould be at risk to a positive test result due to the cocaine she ingested the previous \nSunday (less than 48 hours earlier). (Tr. 70-71) \nReturned test results were positive for cocaine ingestion. Applicant, while \nembarrassed and ashamed, did not challenge the test results and was terminated from \nher employment the following Tuesday of March 2019. (GE 4; GE 4; Tr. 36-37, 78-79) \nAlthough she did not lose her security clearance with her job termination, she is not \neligible for rehire. (Tr. 78) And, as a result, she was able to obtain new employment with \nher current employer. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 79) \nIn the security clearance application Applicant completed in October 2019, she \nacknowledged her not being compliant with her employer\u2019s drug policy as the basis for \nher separation from the company without admitting her March 2019 cocaine use. When \nasked about her prior drug use in a separate section of the application covering drug \nuse within the previous seven years, she acknowledged her cocaine use in 2019. (GE \n1) \nBefore her positive drug test in March 2019, Applicant had never been subjected \nto random drug testing; although her employer at the time did have a random testing \nprogram. (Tr. 68-70, 74-75) Since her positive drug test in March 2019, Applicant has \ntwice been tested for illegal drugs, once in November 2020 to satisfy state medical \nrequirements for prescribed Adderall and again in January 2021 on the suggestion of \nher attorney. (AEs F and L; Tr. 37-39) Non-randomized test results were negative for \nillegal substances in her system. (AEs F and L) \nIn November 2020, Applicant assured under oath that she would abstain from all \nfuture drug involvement and substance misuse and specifically avoid any use of \ncocaine or any other illegal drug in the future, and immediately report any future use of \nan illegal drug to her security officer. She acknowledged her understanding that should \nshe violate her statement of intent, her security clearance and accesses will be denied \nor revoked.

(Tr. 48-52) Her assurances are accepted. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents \nBesides Applicant\u2019s reported 2019 cocaine use incident, she was involved in two \nseparate alcohol-related incidents. The first such incident occurred in July 2007 when \nshe was arrested and charged with DUI. (GEs 2 and 4) Stressed by the passing of her \nmaternal grandmother, Applicant consumed too much alcohol while at a friend\u2019s home \nfor a barbeque. (GE 4; Tr. 39-40) While driving home from the barbeque, she was \nstopped by a police officer and arrested and charged with DUI. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 40) \nEmbarrassed by the incident, she pre-enrolled in an alcohol and substance abuse \nprogram. (GE 4; Tr. 40) \nAppearing in court to answer the pending DUI charges stemming from her 2007 \nDUI incident, Applicant pled guilty and was sentenced to probation before judgment. \nProbation conditions included community service completion of her already-enrolled \nsubstance abuse program. Applicant is credited with successfully completing all of the \nrequirements of her substance abuse program and satisfying the court\u2019s imposed \nprobation conditions. (GEs 2 and 4 and AE G; Tr. 40) \nWhile her 2008 security clearance application was still pending, Applicant was \ninvolved in a second alcohol-related incident. Returning home in March 2012 from a St. \nPatrick\u2019s Day celebration with friends, where she consumed multiple drinks before \ndeparting the tavern in the early morning hours, Applicant was stopped by a state police \nofficer and arrested and charged with DUI. (GEs 1 and 3-4; Tr. 41-42, 60-61) At the time \nshe was stopped and arrested in March 2012, Applicant held a security clearance. (GEs \n1 and 4-5; Tr. 42-43) Breathalyzer test results administered to Applicant by the arresting \nofficer confirmed a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .16%. (GE 4; Tr. 61) Applicant self-\nreported this incident to her FSO. (Tr. 42) \nBefore making her court appearance to address her 2012 DUI charges, Applicant \nenrolled in an outpatient alcoholic substance abuse program that did not include a \ndiagnosis or abstinence recommendation. (GE 4; Tr. 42, 61-62) When she did appear \nfor her scheduled August 2012 court hearing, she pled guilty to the charges in court and \nwas sentenced to 15 days in jail followed by two years of supervised probation that \nincluded an ordered interlock installed on her vehicle. Her imposed sentence included a \nfine of $2,889 (inclusive of court costs). (GEs 3-4; Tr. 43-44) \nApplicant served 13 days of her imposed 2012 sentence before her early release \nfor good behavior and made monthly payments of $112 to repay her court-ordered \nfines. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 44-45) She completed her alcoholic substance abuse program after \nattending regular classes between April 2012 and October 2012.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          The Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to \ninclude the misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the \nuse of other substances that cause physical or mental impairment or \nare used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled\u201d substance defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to \ndescribe any of the behaviors listed above.

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of alcohol-related offenses (two in all) in 2007 and 2012, respectively, which \ntaken together with her 2019 cocaine use incident, reflect pattern behavior incompatible \nwith the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining access to \nclassified information. \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s admission to using cocaine on a single occasion in March 2019 while \nholding a security clearance she was granted in 2012 raises security concerns over \nrisks of recurrence as well as judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence \npresented, three disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for drug \ninvolvement apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \n\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and \n25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position.\u201d \nApplicant justified her isolated use of cocaine provided by a friend on a single \noccasion in March 2019 on the stated grounds that she was emotionally stressed by her \nrecent break-up with her boyfriend and water damage to her home and succumbed to \nthe offer of a warehouse friend who was helping her paint her home. While her \nstatements are not challenged by any conflicting accounts in the record, they do raise \nserious questions about her judgment and appreciation of the importance of the anti-\ndrug policies administered by her employer and the DoD. Whether Applicant has \nlearned enough as a longstanding clearance holder from her use of an illegal substance \n(cocaine) in 2019 to be trusted to avert any future recurrence and maintain compliance \nwith the drug-free requirements for holding a security clearance under the DoD\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance guidelines, is a core issue for deciding based on a consideration of all of the \nfacts and surrounding circumstances in the case. \nUnder the terms and conditions of the Controlled Substance Act (CSA)(21 U.S.C. \n\u00b6 801 et seq.), Congress generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and \npossession of marijuana. (Item 10) It established significant penalties for these crimes. \n(21 U.S.C. \u00b6 841 et seq.) These statutes reflect Congress\u2019s determination that cocaine, \nalong with other covered controlled substances, is a dangerous drug and that cocaine \nactivity (inclusive of use) is a serious crime. DoD guidelines implementing the federal \nlegal ban covering cocaine and other illegal substances require federal prosecutors to \nweigh all relevant considerations when making prosecution decisions. \nWhen the CSA has been challenged on federalism grounds, the courts have not \nattempted to validate any enabling provisions of a state\u2019s statute covering banned \nsubstances under the CSA. See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers \nCooperative, 532 U.S. 483, 495-499 (2001), reaffirming the federal preemption of the \nstate\u2019s competing law legalizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes. In doing so, the \nOakland Cannabis Buyers Court extended its oversight role in ensuring that federal \npreemption jurisdiction over illegal drug violators without regard to the state\u2019s marijuana \nexception. Accord, Raich v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 1, 8-14 (2005) \nIn this case, heightened judgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s one-time use \nof cocaine in March 2019 while holding a security clearance that she has held since \n2012. Not only did her cocaine use violate her own state\u2019s laws banning the use of \ncocaine and other illegal substances, but her cocaine use (isolated as it was) violated \nboth federal law and DoD\u2019s mandated drug-free workplace and drug-free federal \nworkplace policies in place for both DoD employees and DoD contractors. By her own \nacknowledgements, Applicant was at all times aware of these laws and DoD policies in \nplace, in addition to her employer\u2019s anti-drug policies in force. \nFor Applicant, her 2019 cocaine use, while holding a security clearance, violated \nfederal law and both DoD and her employer\u2019s drug-free guidelines. Because of the \ncredited isolated nature of Applicant\u2019s one-time cocaine use in 2019, and the passage \nof time (over two years), she may claim some benefit of two of the mitigating conditions \ncovered by the drug involvement guideline. MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment\u201d; and 26(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement \nand substance misuse, provides evidence of factions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance abuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility,\u201d are \npartially applicable. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s cocaine use was limited and isolated during a stressful time \nin her life, it occurred while she held a security clearance and was thoroughly familiar \nwith the anti-drug policies of both her employer and the DoD. She anticipated the \nlikelihood of losing both her job and her clearance were she to test positive for illegal \ndrugs in 2019. And. while she did not lose her clearance at this point in time as the \nresult of her confirming positive drug test for cocaine, she lost her job under her \nemployer\u2019s drug-free standards that appear to bear even more stringent enforcement \ncriteria in practice than those imposed by the DoD. Because the DoD and its contractors \nwho sponsor employees for security clearances are responsible for administering \ncommon anti-drug policies for employees holding security clearances, security \nclearance decisions generally should not be expected to sanction drug use criteria less \ndemanding than those applied by employers in their administering of their anti-drug \npolicies. \nTo mitigate Applicant\u2019s cocaine use under the facts presented requires an overall \nassessment that takes account of not only her work and personal history but her track \nrecord of observance of rules and regulations in other civil contexts. While Applicant\u2019s \none-time use of cocaine under cited stressful circumstances in March 2019 might be \nisolated and capable of mitigation if considered alone and free of other compounding \nincidents reflecting poor judgment, different findings may be warranted when considered \ncontextually as a part of an unbroken pattern of substance abuse incidents reflecting \nreckless behavior and poor judgment. \nWhile each of the incidents covered by the SOR might conceivably be resolved \nfavorably to Applicant if assessed individually, resolution of the security significance of \nthese incidents cannot be considered piecemeal and still satisfy overall clearly \nconsistent with the national interest eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance. So, while Applicant can be credited with no known history of prior drug abuse \nbeyond her experimenting with marijuana as a teenager and no known recurrence of \nillegal drug use since her March 2019 cocaine incident, her 2019 cocaine incident \ncannot be considered separately and apart from her earlier DUI incidents in making an \noverall assessment of the security significance of her 2019 cocaine incident and its \nimpact on her continued security clearance eligibility. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s one-time use of cocaine in March 2019 are \ncross-alleged and incorporated anew under Guideline E, along with two prior DUIs to \nestablish a pattern of Applicant\u2019s disregard of DoD rules, regulations, and guidelines \nrelated to drugs and alcohol abuse. The three combined drug and alcohol-related \nincidents, while spaced and covered by different guideline concerns, share a common \nthread of security concerns over questionable exercises in judgment. These collective \nerrors in judgment, when considered together contextually, reflect an overall pattern of \npoor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness under the personal conduct \nguideline. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo be sure, neither of Applicant\u2019s DUIs would likely meet appellate \nrequirements for denying clearances under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), if cross-\nalleged separately under that guideline.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0731 at 3 (Sept. \n1996); ISCR Case No. 94-1081 at 5 (August 1995). \nBased on the evidence produced at hearing, one of the DCs covered by the \npersonal conduct guideline is applicable to the developed facts in evidence.

This includes, but is not \nlimited to, consideration of . . .

When considered together in this context, the three SOR-covered \nincidents support a cross-alleged pattern of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nand unreliability properly alleged and proven under Guideline E. \nMitigating conditions are for the most part have only partial applicability to the \nacts of this case.

On October 23, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F.

He attended college for three \nmonths in 2009, but did not earn a degree. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2019. This is his first application for a security clearance. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 11 delinquent debts totaling $33,362, including two federal \nstudent-loan accounts totaling $15,383, which were confirmed by the credit reports. In \nhis SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts. (Items 2, 4-10) \nIn November 2019, Applicant promised to start paying the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g in December 2019; and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d via monthly \npayments of at least $100 for an unspecified period until fully resolved. The record did \nnot reflect that any of these payments had been made. (Item 3 at 46-48) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that the alleged SOR debts remained \nunresolved. He also asserted the following: 1) that he was \u201cworking toward making the \nmoney needed to take care of all these debts;\u201d and 2) that he wants \u201cnothing more than \nto correct [his] past shortcomings and move forward with [his] life and career within the \nworld of government contracting. He contended that he planned on having \u201cmost, if not \nall, of these unpaid debts taken care of by years end.\u201d \nWhile Applicant did not explain why he incurred the SOR debts or why they have \npersisted, some relevant facts were revealed by the record. The SOR debts were \nreported delinquent between 2011 and 2019. Since 2011, Applicant has been \nunemployed three times: 1) from August 2011 through March 2012 (following a layoff); \n2) from April 2014 through July 2014 (following a voluntary resignation); and 3) from \nDecember 2015 through February 2016 (following a layoff). In 2016, Applicant \ndiscovered that he owed $7,774 for a child-support arrearage due to what he described \nas an accounting error on the part of his employer. In his November 2019 SCA, he \nreported that the arrearage was being paid via a wage garnishment. Between March \n2018 and June 2020, Applicant opened five credit-card accounts (with limits between \n$300 and $1,500) and one automobile-loan account (with a high credit of $21,173). As \nof January 2021, he was current on the automobile-loan account and four of the five \ncredit-card accounts. He was at least two payments past due on one of the credit-card \naccounts. The unalleged child-support arrearage and late credit-card account will be \nconsidered only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant did not provide evidence to support any of the following potentially \napplicable mitigating factors: AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nNot only did Applicant fail to resolve any of the alleged debts, but he owes \nsubstantial sums to the federal government for delinquent student-loan accounts. He \nhas continued to rely on credit to pay expenses. I have doubts about whether Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nwill be willing and able to fulfill his promise of resolving the accounts by years end, as \nhe promised, or to otherwise gain control of his finances in a responsible manner. \nTherefore, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis failure to pay delinquent debts. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nReferral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of the COVID pandemic. \nOn February 17, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to \nproceed to a hearing. On April 12, 2021, the case was assigned to me to conduct a \nhearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of \nthe United States to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 20, \n2021, I received the case assignment and file and informed Applicant of the possibility of \nan online video hearing, which he accepted. Following a successful test of the Defense \nCollaboration Services (DCS) system on April 29, 2021, I issued a notice scheduling \nApplicant\u2019s DCS video teleconference hearing for May 20, 2021. \nAt the hearing, six Government exhibits (GEs 1-6) and five Applicant exhibits (AEs \nA-E) were admitted. Applicant objected to the report of his February 2020 psychological \nevaluation (GE 2) in that he met with the psychologist only one time, and to a May 2018 \ncredit report (GE 4) based on the outdated nature of the information. I admitted both \ndocuments in evidence, as his objections went to the weight to be afforded the information \nafter consideration of the record evidence. GEs 1, 3, and 5-6 and AEs A-E were admitted \nin evidence without any objections. The Government withdrew allegation SOR \u00b6 4.f \npertaining to Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) received on June 1, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline I (SOR \u00b6 1.a) that Applicant received mental-\nhealth treatment from approximately May 2017 to December 2018 for diagnosed major \ndepressive disorder-single episode, other specified anxiety disorders, cannabis abuse, \nand alcohol dependence in remission; under Guideline G that Applicant consumed \nalcohol at times to excess and intoxication, from age 20 to at least February 2020 (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a) and that a licensed psychologist determined in February 2020 that Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent and continued level of alcohol use could impact his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness (SOR \u00b6 2.b); under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from age \n18 to at least February 2020 (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and that he abused non-prescribed Ativan in \nJanuary 2017 and was fired from his job after testing positive for the drug (SOR \u00b6 3.b); \nand under Guideline F that, as of the issuance of the SOR on October 27, 2020, Applicant \nowed charged-off debt totaling $24,444 on four accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.d); a $406 \ncollection debt (SOR \u00b6 4.e); a mortgage debt of $152,484 in foreclosure and $25,239 past \ndue (SOR \u00b6 4.f); and a $25 medical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 4.g). \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations except \nfor the mortgage delinquency (SOR \u00b6 4.f) and possibly the medical collection debt, which \nhe had been unable to confirm.

Regarding the Guideline I \nconcern, he explained that he was currently in mental-health treatment. As for the \nGuideline G concerns, Applicant stated that he tries to drink responsibly when he \nconsumes alcohol, and that if he had continued drinking at the same level as February \n2020, it \u201ccould have an impact on [his] judgment and reliability, but not concerning \nclassified information.\u201d He acknowledged that he has used cannabis from about age 18 \nto the present, at a level and frequency that has fluctuated over the years, but he \nexplained that he is now a medical marijuana patient. Applicant admitted that he had \ntaken the Ativan to relax while being unaware of the possible consequences for his non-\nprescribed use. About his financial issues, Applicant explained that he and his spouse \nneeded to settle their mortgage foreclosure situation before resolving other debts and that \nthey are seeking legal advice as to the best course of action to settle their debts. He cited \nseveral factors (loss of employment, an unplanned pregnancy, a knee injury, his \nunderemployment, his spouse\u2019s car accident and her drug rehabilitation) as causes of his \nfinancial difficulties. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old, married, and the father of two sons, ages six and eight. \nA high school graduate, he completed Class A commercial driver training in December \n2014 and took a five-week design/drafting course in 2018. He was employed full time by \na defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman learner for about 11 days from April 2018 \nto May 2018, when he was laid off for lack of a security clearance while his application \nfor security clearance eligibility was pending. He indicates that he is subject to rehire if \nhis clearance eligibility is adjudicated favorably. (GE 1; Tr. 25.) \nSubstance Use and Psychological Issues \nApplicant started drinking alcohol in high school and using cannabis shortly after \ngraduating from high school at age 18. (Tr. 37.) He has used marijuana with varying \nfrequency since then, including four times a week from ages 18 to 38. (GE 3.) However, \nthere were also times of abstention from marijuana for as long as three or four years. (Tr. \n39.) Applicant purchased marijuana for his own consumption, at times on a weekly basis. \n(Tr. 39.) He has continued to use marijuana, albeit now with a medical marijuana card, \nand to use alcohol. He engaged in heavy drinking from ages 20 to 25, although there \nhave been times when he has abstained, and also times of responsible consumption. (GE \n3; Tr. 47.) \nIn June 1993, after Applicant consumed 12 beers to intoxication while socializing \nwith friends, he and his friends stole some items from unlocked vehicles and garages. \nFelony burglary and larceny charges were filed against Applicant but eventually not \nprosecuted. After Applicant consumed ten beers at a bar in October 1997, he was \ninvolved in an altercation with two men. He paid a fine for misdemeanor assault. In July \n1999, Applicant was arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin). \nThe drug had been left in his vehicle by a friend in May 1999.

(GEs 1-2, 6.) Applicant refrained from any \nmarijuana use while he was on probation because he was subject to random urinalysis. \nA year or two later, he resumed using marijuana with a new roommate, whom Applicant \nindicates was \u201ca regular smoker.\u201d (Tr. 38.) \n \nApplicant was employed as a dealer and table games supervisor at a casino from \nOctober 1996 to March 2001 and again from September 2001 to March 2014 when he \nwas terminated following a few incidents involving co-workers or patrons. In September \n2015, Applicant began working as a commercial truck driver. Applicant refrained from \nusing any marijuana for close to three years while in training for, and then working as a \ntruck driver. (Tr. 41-42.) He was terminated from that job in January 2017 after he failed \na random urinalysis. He tested positive for taking Ativan that his spouse gave him from \nher prescription. He had been experiencing considerable anxiety related to some \naccidents on the job, and neither he nor his spouse realized it was a banned substance. \n(GEs 1, 6.) He had used the Ativan as a sleep aid approximately three times in December \n2016. (Tr. 46.) \nDepressed and experiencing anxiety to the point where his spouse was concerned \nabout his mental health, Applicant voluntarily received outpatient mental-health treatment \nfrom late May 2017 to mid-December 2018 for diagnosed major depressive disorder-\nsingle episode, other specified anxiety disorders, cannabis abuse-uncomplicated, and \nalcohol dependence, in remission. He reported on intake that he drank about six beers \nper week and was \u201cself-medicating\u201d with marijuana four times a week. (Tr. 40.) He was \nprescribed Zoloft and advised to cease using marijuana and to continue sobriety with \nrespect to his alcohol use. The clinical records do not expressly indicate that he was told \nto cease using alcohol. However, Applicant testified that the psychiatrist told him to stop \ndrinking. (Tr. 60.) During a session on June 7, 2017, Applicant complained of anger \nmanagement issues and worry about finances. He reported medical marijuana use to \ntreat a physical condition and occasional alcohol use. At each session, the psychiatrist \nadvised him to decrease and stop using marijuana, and discussed \u201cthe risks of marijuana \nwith mood worsening [in the] long run.\u201d With adjustments to his Zoloft and the additions \nof Trazodone and Buspar to his medication regimen, Applicant\u2019s mental health improved. \nDuring a session on September 18, 2017, Applicant reported that he had decreased his \nmarijuana use in that he had smoked the drug only once in the last month. He declined \ntherapy beyond an initial session because of his finances. (GEs 2-3, 6.) Applicant asserts \nthat he reduced his consumption of alcohol \u201cquite a bit\u201d while in treatment with the \npsychiatrist because he was taking psychiatric medications. (Tr. 35.) \nApplicant refrained from marijuana use while looking for work and then in training \nto work for a defense contractor because he did not want it to be held against him by a \nfuture employer. He passed a hair follicle test administered for employment with the \ndefense contractor. (Tr. 43-44.) On March 29, 2018, Applicant completed a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for a defense contractor. He disclosed that \nhe had been in treatment since approximately June 2017 for \u201cborderline personality \ndisorder\u201d and that he had been arrested in 1993, 1997, and 1999.

He denied any other illegal use of a drug in the \nprevious seven years. (GE 1.) \nOn June 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he had received medication \nmanagement for \u201cborderline personality disorder\u201d with symptoms of depression and \nanxiety for the past year, and that he had attended one session of therapy at the \nrecommendation of his psychiatrist. (GE 6.) The session occurred on June 8, 2017. (GE \n2.) There is no indication that Applicant told the OPM investigator about his marijuana \nuse or that he was asked about any use of cannabis. Applicant explained to the \ninvestigator that he elected not to pursue therapy because he felt better on his \nmedications, and it was expensive. Applicant discussed his use of his spouse\u2019s Ativan in \nDecember 2016, and his positive drug screen that led to the loss of his commercial \ndriver\u2019s license and employment as a truck driver. (GE 6.) \nApplicant stopped seeing the psychiatrist after December 2018. He elected instead \nto have his psychiatric medications prescribed and monitored by his primary care \nphysician. His primary care physician suggested that he apply for the state\u2019s medical \nmarijuana program to address some physical ailments. Applicant obtained his medical \nmarijuana card in August 2019, which allows him to purchase up to 2\u00bd ounces of \nmarijuana per month from state-authorized dispensaries. (Tr. 35, 40, 66-67.) His \nphysician has to annually recertify his need for marijuana. (Tr. 40.) Applicant is in his \nsecond year of the program. (Tr. 66.) \nDuring the course of its background investigation, the OPM obtained the records \nof Applicant\u2019s treatment with his former psychiatrist. In early 2020, the DCSA CAF \nreferred Applicant for a psychological evaluation to a licensed psychologist because of \nhis history of alcohol and cannabis use and his mental-health treatment reflected in the \npsychiatrist\u2019s records. During the February 29, 2020 psychological evaluation, Applicant \nreported using both tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD for medical issues under his \nstate\u2019s medical marijuana program, about three times a day, as prescribed by his primary \ncare physician \u201cas needed for any symptoms that may arise.\u201d (Tr. 43.) Applicant\u2019s \njudgment and insight were assessed as adequate, and he appeared relaxed for his \ninterview. He reported no current issues with symptoms of depression, euphoria, mood \ndisturbance, or anxiety, but he indicated that he had stress because of some life \ncircumstances, including involving his spouse, who, after totaling his car in an accident in \nAugust 2019, checked herself into a rehabilitation program. He reported that he was \nworking for his uncle at the time, but had to quit to care for his sons. (GE 2.) \nDuring the evaluation, Applicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol on a daily \nbasis before his spouse went into rehabilitation. His uncle kept beer at work, and he would \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsometimes drink with his uncle at the end of the work day. Applicant would then drink at \nhome with his wife, a half to a full pint of liquor per night. Following his spouse\u2019s return \nfrom her rehabilitation program in mid-November 2019, Applicant limited his alcohol \nconsumption to once every two weeks, and generally beer rather than hard liquor. He \nrefrained from drinking in his spouse\u2019s presence, but a friend would share a six-pack with \nhim when his spouse was out of the house. Applicant reported having consumed three \nbeers and two nips of liquor with his brother the night before his February 2020 evaluation, \nbut no drinking for 1\u00bd weeks before that. He stated that had abstained for two or three \nweeks before his use 1\u00bd weeks prior to his evaluation. He explained that he did not find \nit difficult to maintain that level of consumption. As for his use of medical marijuana, \nApplicant indicated he generally smoked or vaped three times a day: first thing in the \nmorning, after work, and before going to sleep at night. The psychologist opined that \nApplicant did not currently meet the diagnostic criteria for a diagnosable mental-health \ncondition and that the symptoms that led him to seek psychiatric treatment in 2017 were \nsufficiently managed with medication. The alcohol dependence diagnosis of 2017 \nappeared to be based on Applicant\u2019s previous heavy drinking when he was in his 20s. \nThe psychologist nonetheless expressed some concern about Applicant\u2019s recent daily \ndrinking. Although noting the absence of any alcohol-related consequences and the \nreduction in Applicant\u2019s drinking since November 2019, the psychologist opined that \u201chis \ncontinued use of alcohol does not reflect good judgment in light of his history of alcohol \ndependence, and this could be detrimental to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness \nconcerning classified information.\u201d As for Applicant\u2019s use of medical marijuana, \u201cwhile \npermitted under the laws of his state, [it] is exclusionary for granting a security clearance \nunder federal guidelines.\u201d (GE 2.) \nIn May 2020, Applicant\u2019s brother passed away. Applicant \u201cgot into a bad habit of \ndrinking.\u201d (Tr. 61-62.) After drinking heavily that summer, including up to 12 to 15 drinks \nof beer and a few nips over the course of a day while on vacation, he realized that he had \nto get his drinking under control. (Tr. 62-63.) Applicant began weekly treatment with a \nlicensed professional mental-health counselor in November 2020. (AE D; tr. 37.) In May \n2021, the counselor opined that Applicant had not previously truly addressed his trauma \nand mood-related history before now, and that his reported \u201cco-existing issues such as \nalcohol use, excessive spending of money, etc. are all symptoms of this.\u201d She \nacknowledged the DOD\u2019s concerns \u201cregarding the issues outlined that could impact \n[Applicant\u2019s] judgment, impulses, reliability, and truthfulness regarding classified \ninformation,\u201d and indicated that he has started the process, \u201cwith a genuine intent,\u201d to \nwork on improving his situation. She noted that some of the DOD\u2019s concerns had \nimproved, although she did not elaborate in that regard about which issues. She did not \nprovide a diagnosis but addressed his current need for time in therapy and medication \nmanagement to address his issues, including his substance-use issues. (AE D.) \nAs of his May 2021 hearing, Applicant\u2019s psychiatric medications were being \nmonitored by a nurse practitioner. (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant testified that he has worked on \nhis drinking, and that he does not consume as much alcohol as he had in the past. (Tr. \n31.) About his current consumption, Applicant testified: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \nI might have about five drinks a week. My wife doesn\u2019t allow me to have \ndrinks at the house here very much. But every once in awhile, I\u2019ll meet a \nfriend out and we\u2019ll have a beer or two. Maybe a beer and a nip \u2013 fishing or \nsomething. (Tr. 48.) \n \nAs to why he continues to consume alcohol despite his previous diagnosis of \nalcohol dependence \u2013 in remission and being advised to stop drinking by a psychiatrist, \nApplicant responded, \u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always drank just casually. I\u2019ve never seen it as \nbeing a problem if I only have two or three drinks. It\u2019s when I get carried away.\u201d (Tr. 60-\n61.) Sometime in April 2021, Applicant consumed nine or ten beers while socializing with \nfriends in his own home. He admits that he \u201cdefinitely was over the legal limit at some \npoint during the day.\u201d (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant believes that he can control his drinking.

However, he also testified that he knows that there are people working \nfor the defense contractor with their medical marijuana certifications. (Tr. 44-45.) He \nbelieves that \u201cthere\u2019s a strong possibility\u201d that he can work for the defense contractor and \nstill use marijuana as long as he has a medical marijuana card. (Tr. 44.) However, he also \ntestified that if it is not possible to use marijuana and work for a defense contractor, he \ncould stop using and attempt to find alternative treatment for his medical conditions. (Tr. \n44.) He would like to continue his medical marijuana use. (Tr. 45.) \nFinances \nApplicant opened some credit card accounts early on in his marriage to establish \ncredit so that he and his spouse could buy a house. (Tr. 49.) He and his spouse did not \nalways spend wisely, and she did not return to work immediately after the birth of their \nfirst child in March 2013 due to postpartum depression. (Tr. 49.) After losing his job at the \ncasino in March 2014, Applicant was unemployed until September 2015. He spent the \ntime caring for his then infant son, and he collected unemployment compensation during \nthat time. (GE 6.) From October 2014 until December 2014, Applicant attended and \ncompleted a commercial driver training course. (GEs 1-2, 6.) For about 12 to 18 months, \nhe and his spouse were \u201ctreading water,\u201d but it got to the point where they relied on credit \nto pay their utility bills and purchase groceries. (Tr. 49.) His spouse spent irresponsibly, \nand their financial situation \u201cgot out of control.\u201d (Tr. 50.) \n7 \n \nAfter testing positive for Ativan in December 2016, Applicant lost his commercial \ndriver\u2019s license. He struggled to find suitable employment, and was unemployed from \nJanuary 2017 to May 2017. During that time, he attended school for bartending. His \nspouse took $20,000 from her retirement funds to support their family. (GE 6.) Applicant \nworked as a traffic controller for a security company from May 2017 to July 2017, when \nhe was laid off for lack of work. In August 2017, Applicant began working at a pizza \nrestaurant.

He held temporary \nemployment for a short time in January 2018, but he was terminated when he was \nobserved wearing a knee brace to work. Through his state, he enrolled in a manufacturing \npipeline design program at a community college in March 2018. Two weeks into his \ntraining, he received a conditional offer of employment from a defense contractor, pending \nhis successful completion of the training, which ended on March 28, 2018. (GEs 1, 6.) \nAt the end of his training, Applicant completed his March 29, 2018 SF 86. He \nreported some financial difficulties involving routine accounts: $1,500 in hospital bills in \ncollection; unresolved credit-card delinquencies of $9,946 (SOR \u00b6 4.a). $2,731 (not \nalleged), $3,526 (SOR \u00b6 4.d), $4,690 (SOR \u00b6 4.c), and $5,815 (SOR \u00b6 4.b); his mortgage \nthat was past due for $4,016 (allegation withdrawn); and an $876 energy bill (not alleged). \nApplicant explained that he fell behind on the accounts because he was injured at work \nin August 2017, lost his job, and was unable to get new work. He was appealing denial of \na worker\u2019s compensation claim. He added that he was working with his mortgage lender \nto remodify his loan and arrange a payment plan to bring his loan current, and that he \nwas in a program with the energy company to spread out his debt so that he could bring \nhis account up to date. He explained that he was presently unable to make any payments \non the credit-card delinquencies. (GE 1.) \nApplicant started working for the defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman \nlearner in April 2018. He was laid off only weeks later because of a lack of security \nclearance. He understands he would return to work for the employer if his clearance is \nadjudicated favorably. (GE 6.) Applicant went to work for a family member. (Tr. 50.) \nAs of May 2018, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed that he owed credit-card charged \noff balance of $9,945, $4,689, $6,284, and $3,536, and a medical collection debt of $25. \n(GE 4.) When asked about his finances during his June 12, 2018 interview with the OPM \ninvestigator, Applicant stated that he had used credit cards to support himself and his \nfamily, and he stopped making even the monthly minimum payments on some of the \naccounts (a $1,500 hospital debt and those accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.e). He explained \nthat he tried to establish repayment plans with the creditors in November 2017 but none \nwould agree on a payment that he could afford. He volunteered that the creditor in SOR \n\u00b6 4.a had filed for judgment in February 2018, and that he had yet to receive a court date. \nAdditionally, he and his spouse had consulted with a bankruptcy attorney in January 2018 \nto resolve their debt. They had not filed a bankruptcy petition because he did not want a \nbankruptcy to negatively impact his chance of being rehired by the defense contractor. \nHe expressed an intention is to file after he is rehired. He added that he had rectified his \nmortgage issues and was making timely payments following a loan modification. \nApplicant did not recognize the $25 medical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 4.g) on his credit \nrecord. He stated that he had taken an online credit-counseling course and attended a \nmortgage crisis job training program to improve his financial situation.

Applicant was unemployed until late \nJanuary 2020, when he began working for a manufacturing machine company. (Tr. 50, \n56.) He left that job in May 2020, when his brother died. Applicant was emotionally \ndistraught and unable to work without compromising his and others\u2019 safety. (Tr. 57.) As \nof May 2020, the credit bureaus were reporting no progress on Applicant resolving the \ncredit-card delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.d. Additionally, a $406 satellite television debt \nwas in collection (SOR \u00b6 4.e), and his mortgage loan was in foreclosure. (GE 5.) Applicant \nand his spouse were approved for a mortgage loan modification in October 2020, which \nlowered their monthly payment from $985 to $886. (GE 4.) They have made timely \nmortgage payments since then. (AEs A-C, E.) However, as of May 2021, the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.c-4.e were still on his credit record as unpaid. (AEs A-C.) The creditor \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 4.a had offered to settle Applicant\u2019s balance for $2,000. Applicant \nhas not been able to reach the creditor about the proposed settlement. (Tr. 26.) There is \nno evidence of record showing that the debt in SOR \u00b6 4.b has been resolved, although it \nis no longer listed on his credit report. \nApplicant has been unemployed for a year as of his May 2021 hearing. (Tr. 26, \n51.) He has been collecting unemployment compensation for the last year. It is currently \nthe minimum of $200 per week plus the $300 stimulus. (Tr. 57-58.) His spouse has been \nemployed as a dealer at a casino since 2006, with the exception of a brief furlough and \ntime off after the birth of their children. (Tr. 57.) She works four days a week and her \nearnings fluctuate depending on tips. She averages about $25 to $35 per hour in tips, \nand brings home about $850 per week. (Tr. 51, 59.) He and his spouse have \u201cjust under \n$10,000 in [their] savings account.\u201d (Tr. 26, 52.) Applicant has had some credit counseling \nbecause he and his spouse are contemplating filing for bankruptcy.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nApplicant experienced depression and anxiety that was exacerbated after he \nwitnessed a suicide on the highway and was involved in an accident while driving a dump \ntruck. His symptoms led him to seek treatment, consisting of medication management, \nfrom a psychiatrist in May 2017. The psychiatrist diagnosed him, in part, with major \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndepression disorder-single episode, and other specified anxiety disorders, and prescribed \nZoloft (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Over the course of the clinical relationship, medications were added \nand adjustments made to improve his symptoms. In February 2020, a licensed clinical \npsychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD, opined that Applicant did not currently \nmeet the clinical criteria for a mental-health condition that could negatively impact his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness as his mental health was being successfully \nmanaged by his psychotropic medications. However, there is evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nmental health was negatively impacted by his brother\u2019s untimely death in May 2020. \nAccording to her May 2021 letter, Applicant\u2019s current therapist does not feel that \nApplicant\u2019s trauma and mood-related history had been truly addressed previously. She \ndid not provide a diagnosis, but acknowledged that he needs \u201cthe time and opportunity to \nput in the work needed through therapy [and] medication compliance\u201d to improve his \nsituation. \nPsychological issues unrelated to gambling can be disqualifying under one or more \nof the following adjudicative criteria: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThere is no indication that Applicant has engaged in any specific behavior that in \nand of itself is symptomatic of his diagnosed depression or anxiety. Before seeking \nmedication management from a psychiatrist in May 2017, his condition was debilitating \nenough that he was unable to work. Even so, the evidence falls short of establishing AG \n\u00b6 28(a). While depression and anxiety are conditions that could impair his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, AG \u00b6 28(b) is also not clearly established. The licensed \npsychologist who evaluated Applicant in February 2020 did not have concerns for his \nmental health at that time. Applicant\u2019s current therapist indicates that Applicant exercised \nquestionable judgment and decision making in the past, and that he needs more time to \nwork on his issues. That said, her comment that \u201cthere are various issues that he needs \ncontinued work on,\u201d is too ambiguous to satisfy AG \u00b6 28(b). AG \u00b6 28(c) has not been \nshown to apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 28(d), there is no evidence that Applicant has failed to \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntake prescribed medications or missed any counseling sessions. His co-existing \nsubstance abuse of marijuana and alcohol was contrary to medical advice; however those \nissues are best addressed under Guidelines H and G, respectively. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides for possible mitigation under the following conditions: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant is credited with voluntarily seeking and pursuing treatment for his mental \nhealth from May 2017 to December 2018 with the psychiatrist, continuing his medication \nmanagement under the care of his primary physician since then, and pursuing therapy \nsince November 2020. AG \u00b6 29(a) has some applicability in that his mental health issues \nare controllable with treatment. By all accounts, he appears to be in compliance with his \ncurrent therapy, although in that regard, some issues persist. He did not follow the advice \nof his psychiatrist to remain sober from alcohol and marijuana while under that clinician\u2019s \ncare. \nWith respect to AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(b) and 29(c), it can reasonably be concluded that as far \nas the psychological issues are concerned, the psychologist who evaluated Applicant for \nthe DOD in February 2020 gave him a good prognosis. To the extent that mood issues \nresurfaced on the death of his brother, Applicant is currently in counseling to address his \nongoing mood and substance abuse issues. The salient issue is whether his therapist \nhas given him a favorable prognosis. She indicated that Applicant is working towards \nimproving his situation with a genuine intent. It is unclear to what extent his current mental \nhealth poses a problem for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. What can be \nsaid is that Applicant knows he has an issue and is taking positive steps to address his \nbehavioral health. He has a favorable track record of taking his prescribed medications. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo the extent that psychological conditions persist, they are currently of less concern than \nhis substance abuse for the reasons that follow. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant began drinking alcohol in high school. His drinking led to his arrest after \nhe stole some items from garages when he was age 17. When he was 21, he was \ninvolved in an altercation while intoxicated, and paid a fine for the assault. These incidents \nwere not alleged, but they show the negative impact alcohol had on Applicant from an \nearly age. He admits that he drank heavily from ages 20 to 25. \nAvailable counseling records indicate that, when he sought psychiatric treatment \nin May 2017, he reported that he was drinking alcohol only occasionally, about six beers \nper week. His then treating psychiatrist diagnosed him with alcohol dependence in \nremission. Applicant asserts that he reduced his consumption of alcohol while in \ntreatment with the psychiatrist, and there is no evidence of any alcohol-related impairment \nduring that time. However, he also acknowledges that he did not follow his psychiatrist\u2019s \nadvice to cease drinking. After he lost his job as a truck driver following a positive test for \nAtivan in December 2016, Applicant struggled to find stable employment. He worked for \na defense contractor for about 11 days in April 2018 when he was laid off because of a \nlack of security clearance. He then worked for his uncle from about the summer of 2018 \nuntil October 2019. His uncle kept beer at work, and Applicant would sometimes drink \nwith his uncle at the end of the work day. Applicant also drank at home with his wife, a \nhalf to a full pint of liquor per night, until his spouse went into rehabilitation in October \n2019. Applicant had to quit his work to care for his children, and he reduced his \nconsumption to beer once every two weeks. On occasion, he shared a six-pack of beer \nwith a friend. While noting the substantial reduction in Applicant\u2019s drinking over the \nprevious three months, the psychologist who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in February \n2020 had some concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption because of his recent \npattern of consuming liquor nightly before his spouse entered her rehabilitation program. \nAfter the untimely death of his brother in May 2020, Applicant resorted to alcohol to deal \nwith the trauma. He drank heavily that summer, including up to 12 to 15 drinks of beer \none day while on vacation. \nAG \u00b6 22 lists seven potentially disqualifying conditions in cases of excessive \nalcohol consumption, as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests in June 1993 and October 1997 are the type of \nincidents contemplated within AG \u00b6 22(a), but they were not alleged and so cannot be \nconsidered in disqualification. AG \u00b6 22(a) does not apply. There is no evidence of any \nalcohol-related impairment at work that could possibly trigger AG \u00b6 22(b). AG \u00b6 22(c) is \nestablished. Applicant engaged in binge if not habitual consumption of alcohol when he \nwas ages 20 to 25; again in 2019 when he drank up to a pint of liquor per night with his \nspouse before she entered rehabilitation; and during the summer of 2020 following the \ndeath of his brother (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Binge consumption of alcohol is not defined in the AGs \nor the Directive. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge \ndrinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration to 0.08 \ngrams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume five or more drinks \nin about two hours. For further information see https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-\nsheets/binge-drinking.htm. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 22(d), the Government did not seek to disqualify Applicant under \nGuideline G on the basis of the psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol dependence-in \nremission, presumably because the duly-qualified psychologist, who evaluated Applicant \nin February 2020, felt that Applicant had moderated his consumption to where he no \nlonger met the criteria for a dependency diagnosis. Even so, the psychologist had \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of his heavy drinking during the summer \nof 2010 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). When evaluating the risk presented by his ongoing consumption of \nalcohol, I cannot ignore that Applicant had previously been diagnosed with alcohol \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndependency in remission or that his continued drinking, at times to excess, was contrary \nto medical advice to remain sober. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 23 provides for \nmitigation under the following conditions: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrate a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant asserts that he currently consumes about five drinks of alcohol a week, \nusually beer. Applicant may be drinking less now than he did during the summer of 2020 \nwhen he \u201cgot into a bad habit of drinking\u201d following the death of his brother, but he \nadmitted consuming nine or ten beers while socializing with friends within weeks of his \nMay 2021 hearing. Whether or not that qualifies as binge consumption, it is problematic \nin light of his alcohol abuse history and alcohol dependency diagnosis. While his alcohol \nuse disorder was in remission as of May 2017, and a licensed clinical psychologist felt \nthat Applicant had moderated his consumption as of February 2020 to no longer warrant \na dependency diagnosis, the psychologist had some concerns about his recent daily \ndrinking such that she felt his alcohol consumption could negatively impact his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. The evidence bears out her concerns about his drinking in \nthat Applicant relapsed into heavy drinking in the summer of 2020. AG \u00b6 23(a) cannot \nreasonably apply. \nApplicant is credited under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(c) with pursuing counseling since \nNovember 2020 to address his alcohol consumption. However, it is too soon to conclude \nthat his maladaptive alcohol use is safely in the past. He does not believe that his present \nconsumption of alcohol is a problem. His current counselor indicates that, while some of \nthe issues of security concern have improved, he \u201cneeds the time and opportunity to put \nin the work needed through therapy, medication compliance, taking care of his physical \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth, addressing substance issues . . . to foster further improvement.\u201d To the extent that \nher assessment is positive about his voluntary decision to enter therapy to address the \nconcerns, it is not clear that Applicant has demonstrated a \u201cclear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d \nor that he is making \u201csatisfactory progress.\u201d None of the mitigating conditions fully applies. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use, even use that \nis for medical reasons under state law, do not alter the national security adjudicative \nguidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law concerning the use, sale, or \nmanufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making eligibility decisions for sensitive \nnational security positions. Federal agencies are statutorily prohibited from granting or \nrenewing national security eligibility for any covered individual who is an unlawful user of \na controlled substance or is an addict. \nApplicant has used marijuana for most of the last 26 or 27 years (SOR \u00b6 3.a). He \nstarted using marijuana at age 18 and used it about four times a week for the next 20 \nyears. He abstained from marijuana while in training and then working as a commercial \ntruck driver, but after he lost his job for testing positive for Ativan, which he took from his \nspouse\u2019s prescription on about three occasions in December 2016 (SOR \u00b6 3.b), he turned \nto marijuana to self-medicate and used the drug four times per week. On his intake for \npsychiatric care in May 2017, he was diagnosed with cannabis use-uncomplicated. He \ncontinued to use marijuana despite being advised to stop by his then treating psychiatrist. \nApplicant reported a decrease in the frequency of his marijuana use in September 2017, \nbut since acquiring his marijuana card in about August 2019, he has used marijuana with \nsome regularity. As of February 2020, he was using marijuana three times a day. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFive potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply. They are: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia; \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana since 1994 and his use of non-prescribed Ativan in \nDecember 2016 amply establish the security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nApplicant admits that he purchased marijuana illegally before he received his medical \nmarijuana card. Although his illegal purchases were not alleged, AG \u00b6 25(c) applies \nbecause of his illegal possession. AG \u00b6 25(b) applies because he tested positive for \nAtivan after illegally using the drug in December 2016. Regarding AG \u00b6 25(g), Applicant \nintends to continue to use marijuana to alleviate his physical ailments. He believes that \nhe can use marijuana for medical purposes and work for a defense contractor because \nhe knows some individuals with medical marijuana cards currently employed by the \ndefense contractor. An individual licensed to use marijuana for medical purposes may be \nable to work for a defense contractor. They may hold a job that does not require a security \nclearance. However, they cannot access classified material or hold a DOD security \nclearance and use marijuana, even if their use is legal under state law. Appendix B of the \nAGs provides that an individual who is an unlawful user of a controlled substance is \nstatutorily prohibited from being granted security clearance eligibility. Applicant was using \nmarijuana three times a day as of May 2021. \nApplicant testified that he is willing to try alternative therapies to marijuana if he \ncannot use marijuana for medical purposes and work for the defense contractor. While I \nhave no reason to doubt his sincerity in that regard, he has established no period of \nabstinence from which I could conclude that he can be counted on to abstain from \nmarijuana use. He cannot reasonably satisfy the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26, \nwhich are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal \ndrug \ninvolvement \nand \nsubstance \nmisuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility;  \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nMarijuana has been a part of Applicant\u2019s lifestyle for the past two decades. He \nmanaged to abstain while working as a trucker, but relies heavily on the drug to mitigate \nphysical ailments. He has not educated himself about the DOD policy and is seemingly \nwilling to disregard federal law. At this juncture, little confidence can be placed in a \npromise to try alternative treatments if he is granted a clearance. His involvement with \nAtivan is not likely to reoccur because his psychiatric medications appear to be \nadequately managing his mental health issues. The same cannot be said for his \nmarijuana use based on the record evidence. The drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAs of the October 2020 SOR, Applicant owed $24,444 in delinquent credit-card \nbalances on four accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.d), a $406 past-due debt for satellite television \nservice (SOR \u00b6 4.e), and a $25 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 4.g). Applicant did not \nrecognize the $25 medical collection debt when asked about it during his interview with \nthe OPM investigator. The debt may have been overlooked, although it does not appear \non his most recent credit report. Whether or not it is owed, it is of little current security \nconcern because of the balance. Applicant can afford to pay it if it is owed. The undisputed \ncredit-card debts were charged off (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.d), and the $406 debt was in collection. \nThese delinquent accounts establish two disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant has the burden of establishing sufficient mitigation to overcome the \nfinancial concerns raised by his failure to meet his financial obligations according to their \nrepayment terms. One or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in \nwhole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply because the delinquencies are ongoing. The \nAppeal Board has repeatedly held that unresolved debts constitute a continuing course \nof conduct. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). Applicant admits that, as of May 2021, \nthat he has made no progress toward resolving the debts. \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). He fell behind on some \nfinancial accounts after he was injured at work and lost his job in August 2017. With the \nexceptions of some temporary work in January 2018 and 11 days of employment with the \ndefense contractor in April 2018, he was unemployed from August 2017 to the summer \nof 2018, when he began working for his uncle. He had to quit working in October 2019 \nwhen his spouse went into rehabilitation, and was unemployed until late January 2020, \nwhen he began working for a manufacturing machine company. He left that job in May \n2020 because of mental health and substance abuse issues triggered by the trauma of \nhis brother\u2019s unforeseen death. However, Applicant has not been without some income \nover the past year in that he has collected an unemployment benefit of $200 per week \nplus the $300 stimulus. \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether he has since acted in a \nreasonable manner to address his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at \n4, n. 9 (App. Bd. Jan. 23, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, \n2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component of sound financial judgment is whether \nApplicant maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current or settle his debts. Applicant\u2019s evidence falls short in that \nregard. He and his spouse have about $10,000 in savings, and yet, they have not \naddressed any of his delinquent debts. He and his spouse consulted with a bankruptcy \nattorney in January 2018 but have yet to file a petition because Applicant believes would \nnegatively impact his chance of being rehired by the defense contractor. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot mitigate his continued disregard of the debts of concern to the DOD. \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been fully established. While the allegation \npertaining to his delinquent mortgage loan has been withdrawn as a concern, Applicant \nis credited with obtaining a loan modification of his home loan to remove it from \nforeclosure status. He has had some financial counseling because of the contemplated \nbankruptcy filing, but it would be premature to find the financial considerations mitigated \nwithout some proof of progress on resolving the delinquencies.

Dec. 19, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018). Applicant\u2019s plan to file for bankruptcy is not enough \nto trigger AG \u00b6 20(d) in mitigation. The Appeal Board has previously explained what \nconstitutes a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts, as follows: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u2018good-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good faith \u2018requires a \nhosing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant \nmust do more than merely show that he or she related on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d] \nmitigating condition. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nA bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 or a track record of timely bankruptcy \npayments under a Chapter 13 plan could trigger AG \u00b6 20(c), in that an applicant would \nno longer have legal liability for repayment of those debts subject to a Chapter 7 \ndischarge, and a track record of Chapter 13 payments could well indicate that the debts \nare being resolved. However, it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) without proof of \na discharge or compliance with a Chapter 13 plan. Moreover, a discharge in bankruptcy \nmay give a person a financial fresh start, but it does not substitute for evidence of a \ndemonstrated track record of financial reform, a track record that is necessary to satisfy \nApplicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue access to classified information for him. AG \u00b6 20(e) is relevant only to \nthe extent that he may not owe the $25 medical collection debt in SOR \u00b6 4.g. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not adequately mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof Applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines I, G, H, and F are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). With respect to Guideline I, no negative \ninference is drawn because of his mental-health counseling, which is clearly a positive \nstep in addressing the issues of security concern. At the same time, neither the traumatic \nevents he has experienced nor his physical ailments excuse his ongoing violations of \nfederal drug laws. Applicant has been forthright about his mental health struggles and \nsubstance abuse, but his trustworthiness in that regard is not enough to overcome the \nsignificant security concerns in several adjudicative issue areas. It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.f:  \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 4.g: \nFor Applicant \n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nElizabeth M.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been employed with the defense contractor since February of 2020. She currently does not hold a security clearance. Since November of 2018, she has been pending divorce from her spendthrift husband. She has one child. (TR at page 20 line 15 to page 29 line 3.)

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR soon thereafter, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January \n27, 2021, scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2021. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, which were admitted \ninto evidence, without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. Applicant offered \nseven documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through G, and were \nadmitted into evidence. The record was left open until April 23, 2021, for receipt of \n\n \n2 \n \nadditional documentation. On April 23, 2021, Applicant offered nine documents, which I \nmarked as AppXs H through P, and were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on March 5, 2021. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, except for SOR allegation \u00b6 1.j. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since February of 2020. She currently does not \nhold a security clearance. Since November of 2018, she has been pending divorce from \nher spendthrift husband. She has one child. (TR at page 20 line 15 to page 29 line 3.) \nShe attributes her current financial situation her husband\u2019s deleterious spending ways. \nIn addition, he also lost his job in 2017. (Id and TR at page 30 lines 10~13.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a.  Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $13,741 to Creditor \nA, as the result of the repossession of one of her husband\u2019s many motor vehicles. (TR \nat page 29 line 11 to page 32 line 25.) This debt has been cancelled by Creditor A, as \nevidenced by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-C. (AppX F.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b.  Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $12,510 to Creditor \nB, as the result of the repossession of another one of her husband\u2019s many motor \nvehicles. (TR at page 33 line 1 to page 35 line 4.) This debt has been cancelled by \nCreditor B, as evidenced by an IRS Form 1099-C. (AppX G.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $7,961 to Creditor \nC, as the result of the repossession of another one of her husband\u2019s many motor \nvehicles. (TR at page 35 line 18 to page 39 line 8.) This debt was settled for $800, of \nwhich Applicant has already paid $600, as evidenced by documentation from a \nsuccessor creditor to this debt. (AppX D.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.d.  Applicant admits that she has a past-due debt for about $5,900 to Creditor \nD, as the result of the repossession of another one of her husband\u2019s many motor \nvehicles. (TR at page 37 line 5 to page 39 line 8.) This vehicle was acquired by her \nestranged husband just prior to the divorce filing, and Applicant is making a good-faith \neffort to address this past-due debt. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $3,261 to Creditor \nE. (TR at page 39 line 10 to page 40 line 7.) This debt \u201cis paid in full,\u201d as evidenced by \ndocumentation from a successor creditor to this debt. (AppX M.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $3,023 to Creditor F. \n(TR at page 40 lines 9~20.) She is making monthly payments of $302, with a reduced \nbalance due of $1,209, as evidenced by documentation from Creditor F. (AppX C.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admits that she has a past-due debt for about $2,633 to Creditor \nG, as the result of cosigning for one of her estranged husband\u2019s credit cards. (TR at \npage 40 line 21 to page 41 line 15.) I find that Applicant is making a good-faith effort to \naddress this past-due debt. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $2,164 to Creditor \nH. (TR at page 41 line 16 to page 42 line 10.) This debt has a \u201c$0.00\u201d balance, as \nevidenced by documentation from a successor creditor to this debt. (AppX H.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.i.  Applicant admits that she had a past-due medical debt for about $850 to \nCreditor I. (TR at page 40 lines 9~20.) She has paid of $595 towards this debt, with \nreduced balance due of $397, as evidenced by Applicant\u2019s banking records. (AppX I.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.j. Applicant denies that she had a past-due medical debt for about $735 to \nCreditor J. (TR at page 44 line 4 to page 45 line 14.) She avers, credibly, that this \nmedical debt has been paid by her health insurance, and it does not appear on the \nGovernment\u2019s most recent January 2021 credit report. (GX 4.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n1.k. Applicant admits that she had a past-due medical debt for about $698 to \nCreditor K. (TR at page 45 lines 15~23.) She has paid $116 towards this debt, as \nevidenced by documentation from Creditor K. (AppX I.) I find that Applicant is making a \ngood-faith effort to address this past-due debt. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.l. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $580 to Creditor L. \n(TR at page 45 line 24 to page 46 line 23.) This debt has a \u201c$0.00\u201d balance, as \nevidenced by documentation from Creditor L. (AppX J.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.m. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $346 to Creditor M. \n(TR at page 46 line 24 to page 47 line 12.) She has made two payments of $173 \ntowards this debt, with reduced balance due of zero, as evidenced by Applicant\u2019s \nbanking records. (AppX K.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.n. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $329 to Creditor N. \n(TR at page 47 lines 13~21.) She is making monthly payments of $60 towards this debt, \nas evidenced by documentation from Creditor N. (AppX A.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.o. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $242 to Creditor O. \n(TR at page 47 line 23 to page 48 line 25.) She has made a payment of $242 towards \nthis debt in November of 2020, with reduced balance due of zero, as evidenced by \nApplicant\u2019s banking records. (AppX L.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.p.. 1.r. and 1.s. Applicant admits that she had past-due medical debts totaling \nabout $387 to Creditor P. (TR at page 49 lines 1~19.) This account is no longer past \ndue, as evidenced by Applicant\u2019s banking records. (AppX E.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.q. Applicant admits that she had a past-due debt for about $124 to Creditor Q. \n(TR at page 49 line 20 to page 50 line 5.) She has made a payment of $124 towards \nthis debt in November of 2020, with reduced balance due of zero, as evidenced by \nApplicant\u2019s banking records. (AppX L.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s financial problems can be attributed to her estranged \nhusband. He has a long history of delinquencies. She is now addressing or has \naddressed all of the alleged past-due debts. Financial Considerations is found for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace. She performs well at her job. (AppXs O and P.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.s.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            Personal Conduct \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                                 Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special \ninterest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative processes . . . AG \n\u00b6 15. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

This conclusion is \nreached after examination of both the plain text of DC \u00b616(g) and case precedents. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-20084 (Aug. 16, 2007)(knowingly employing an illegal \nimmigrant); ISCR Case No. 07-07645 (Jan. 7, 2009)(married to an illegal immigrant); \nISCR Case No. 07-05407 (March 31, 2008)(engaged to an illegal immigrant); ISCR \nCase No. 08-03647(Feb. 19, 2009)(married to an illegal immigrant); and ISCR Case No. \n18-00753( Oct. 31, 2018)(married to an illegal immigrant).  \n \n \nWhile these cited decisions lack precedential authority, they draw support from \nthe Appeal Board (ISCR Case No. 07-07645 at 5 (App. Bd. March 25, 2009) and \nprovide persuasive authority for finding Applicant\u2019s residing with an undocumented \nMexican national to be incompatible with the trust requirements for holding a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s documented DoHS petition approval (with verification caveats) \ndoes not in and of itself grant any legal immigration status to Applicant\u2019s husband and \ndoes not guarantee that the \u201calien beneficiary will subsequently be found to be eligible \nfor a visa.\u201d (Item 3)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s residing with a Mexican national \n(her husband) whose undocumented entry into the United States and continued \nresidency in the country is in violation of the federal immigration laws in force. \nApplicant\u2019s continued residing with an undocumented Mexican national in violation of \nU.S. immigration laws warrants the application of disqualifying condition (DC), \u00b6 16(g), \n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity\u201d of the personal conduct guideline. \nFinal visa and legal residency status of Applicant\u2019s husband rests with DoS\u2019s \nNVC\u2019s processing center that remains pending. Based on the limited information \nprovided by Applicant, she may not take advantage of any of the mitigating guidelines at \nthis time. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n        \n        \n \n \n                         \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nWhole-person Assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her history of association with an undocumented Mexican \nnational without any demonstrated compliance with federal immigration laws is \notherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a security clearance. While \nApplicant is entitled to credit for her civilian contributions to the defense industry, her \nefforts to date are not enough to overcome her marriage and co-habitation with an \nundocumented Mexican national who has been and continues to be in violation of \nfederal immigration laws. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. He is married and has two children, ages 8 and 11. He \nhas worked as a software developer for his own independent-contractor business for \napproximately 24 years. He holds a bachelor degree in computer science and \nmathematics. He is seeking a security clearance for the first time.

The allegation is established by his security application admissions, his \nadmissions to a defense investigator during his background investigation, and his \nadmissions in his SOR answer. (GE 1, 2; SOR answer) \nApplicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 1977. He \nhas continued his use of marijuana as recently as two days before his hearing. He uses \nmarijuana casually and recreationally to relax. He does not use it during work hours or \nto excess. He purchases his marijuana from a legal dispensary in his state. Marijuana \nuse does not violate state law where he resides. He compares his marijuana use to \nsomeone\u2019s recreational use of alcohol. His wife is aware of his marijuana use, and she \nalso occasionally uses marijuana. He intends to use marijuana in the future. He clarified \nthat he would stop using marijuana if he received a security clearance and his employer \nor client required such abstinence. Applicant pointed out the national trend on the state \nlevel toward legalization of marijuana. He also provided an article that compared alcohol \nuse versus marijuana use in terms of short-term effects, and long-term effects, and \npotential for misuse.

(Tr. 23-24, 29-30, 35; AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant started using marijuana in approximately 1977 and continues to use it \nthrough the present time. During his testimony, he stated his intent was to continue \nusing marijuana. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent and as recent as July 2021, two days \nbefore his security clearance hearing. He did not provide a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all future illegal drug use. Additionally, at his hearing, he indicated his \nintent was to continue his use of marijuana, which he qualified by saying that if he was \ngranted a clearance and was required to stop using marijuana by his employer, he \nwould do so. Given his recent pattern of use, and his stated intent to continue his \nmarijuana use, his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are called into \nquestion. While I understand his position that marijuana and alcohol use might be \nsimilar in a number of ways, they are dissimilar in terms of federal law on the legality of \nuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s community \nactivities, including his volunteering. I also considered his reputation for truthfulness, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. However, I also considered that his regular use of \nmarijuana began in 1977, he continued to use it as recently as two days before his \nhearing, and his expressed intent to continue using marijuana. Despite his positive \nfamily, work, and community qualities, his intentional disregard for obeying federal law \nby continuing his use of marijuana does not put him in a position to hold a security \nclearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph     1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.

Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has \nnot mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanations. \n(Item 2) \nShe is 58 years-old and unmarried with no children. Applicant attended \ncollege, and she obtained her undergraduate degree in 1984. She received a graduate \ndegree in March 2010. She has also attended college classes from 2010 to 2015. \nApplicant completed her most recent security clearance application on August 5, 2019. \nShe retired from employment in 2010 after working 20 years and has worked for her \ncurrent employer as a scheduler since July 2019. (Item 4) Applicant does not currently \nhold a security clearance. (Item 3) \nFinancial \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on \nfive occasions from 1989 to 2017, and has a delinquent credit card account placed in \ncollection. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations. She stated in her Answer that \nunemployment was the reason for two bankruptcies in 2010 and 2011. However, she \nfiled for bankruptcy protection twice while she was employed full time. Her November \n2010, Chapter 13 bankruptcy claimed $64,377 in unsecured non-priority debts, which \nconsisted of primarily student loans and other unsecured loans. (1.c) SOR (1.b) was \ndismissed in 2011 due to unemployment and subsequent inability to make the payment \nplans. (Item 2, 10) She elaborated that her decision to seek bankruptcy protection was \nmade at the advice of her attorney. She elaborated that in 2010 she had medical \nproblems and was granted a medical release from her job of almost 20 years. Her \nincome changed significantly and has never been the same. She acknowledged that \nshe takes the responsibility for not downsizing and changing her living habits as she \nshould. \n2 \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, an active Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in June 2017, she \nclaimed $168,802 in student loans and $9,927 in other non-priority debts. Her plan was \nconfirmed in 2017, amended in February 2018, and modified twice in November 2018 \nbased on the trustee\u2019s assertion that Applicant is party to a lawsuit or other course of \naction that might result in additional disposable income. In January 2020, the trustee \nmoved to dismiss the bankruptcy following Applicant\u2019s failure to make plan payments; \nand an income withholding order was issued to withhold plan payments from Applicant\u2019s \nwages. Applicant submitted a copy of the Trustee\u2019s report of receipts and disbursement \nfor this case. It does not appear that there is a delinquency of $5,203.10. (Item 9) She \nhas shown that payments were made until December 9, 2020. (Response to FORM) \nThe motion to dismiss was withdrawn on May 4, 2020.

(Item 11) The bankruptcy was dismissed in \n2011. The 2011 Chapter 13 bankruptcy reported essentially the same debts associated \nwith the 2010 filing. This was dismissed as discussed above for failure to make plan \npayments. \nAs to SOR 1.d, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in September \n2005, claiming $20,928 in unsecured non-priority debts such as cash advances, credit \ncard debt, consumer service accounts and unsecured loans. This bankruptcy was \ndischarged in October 2008. (Item 12) \nApplicant first filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, SOR 1.e, in 1989. It was \nconverted to Chapter 7 and discharged in August 1995. (Item 13) \nAs to SOR 1.f, a collection account that was her mother\u2019s, Applicant has \nconsistently made payments on the account and submitted documentation to support \nher $50 monthly payments since 2015, with a current balance of $2,363, reduced from \nthe original balance of $3,013. (Attachment to Answer) \nIn Applicant\u2019s subject interviews of 2019 and 2012, Applicant stated that she \nreally did not understand the bankruptcy process when she first filed and dismissed the \nearly ones. As to the last 2017 filing, she stated that she became unemployed in 2017 \nand decided to file for bankruptcy. She pays $379 a month to the bankruptcy trustee. \nApplicant has student loans that are not included in the bankruptcy plans, but she has \nno documentation that she has paid them. She claims they are in deferment, but \nprovided no information concerning the issue. The student loans occurred between \n2008 and 2015. (Items 5, 8) \nApplicant also blamed gambling habits and overextending on spending for her \n2005 filing. She admits over extension in debt, spending above her means, and using \ntoo many credit cards. (Item 7) She admitted the debts were not tied to circumstances \nbeyond her control. Also, she was 90 to 180 days delinquent on accounts before filing \nfor bankruptcy. She has never sought financial counseling. \nIn 2012, Applicant reported that her gambling habits led to some of her financial \ndifficulties and that she would gamble an average of twice every three months. She \nused gambling as a hobby and entertainment. (Item 7) She did not believe that it \nimpacted many of her accounts. It is not clear from the record whether she still gambles. \nApplicant is now gainfully employed. There is no information in the record \nconcerning her salary, use of a financial counselor, (except the requisite counseling \nwhen filing a bankruptcy), or budget. There are no character references. When \nApplicant was gainfully employed before her retirement in 2010, she received two \nbankruptcy discharges: a Chapter 7 discharge (converted from Chapter 13) in August \n1995, and a Chapter 13 discharge in 2008. (Items 3, 12, 13) Two months after \nretirement, she filed a third bankruptcy, which was dismissed for failure to make plan \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \npayments. (Item 11) This bankruptcy included student loans that appear to be \nassociated with her 2010 graduate degree. Additional student loans are also claimed in \nthe active bankruptcy. (Item 9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her bankruptcy schedules and her credit \nreports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and \n19 (g) failure. \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and her credit reports confirm, that she gambled and did not \nmaintain her finances. Granted she had some unemployment, but she chose to gamble \nand file for bankruptcy instead of making payments on her accounts. She has not \nreceived financial counseling and there is a pattern of filing for bankruptcy over a period \nof many years. She is now in an active Chapter 13, 2017 filing. She has not provided \nevidence of payments on her student loans which are not included in her bankruptcy. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable because she does not have her finances under control. \nApplicant provided no credible nexus as to the short periods of unemployment \nand her inability to pay her debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but she did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. In fact, she admitted none of the financial issues \nwere beyond her control. She utilized the bankruptcy process, which is a legitimate way \nof resolving debt, but she has shown a pattern of misuse of this legal process over \nmany years. \nApplicant\u2019s inaction regarding the debts precludes a conclusion that her finances \nare mitigated. She did not receive credit counseling. AG\u00b6 20 (c) does not apply. She \nmade some payment plan for one collection account. AG\u00b6 20(d) partially applies. Due to \nthe pattern of bankruptcy filings there is no record of whether the underlying problem \nhas been resolved. Based on the evidence produced by Applicant, it is impossible to \nconclude she made a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve her debts or that her financial \nsituation is under control. The Government has cause to question whether Applicant will \nsuccessfully complete the terms of her active Chapter 13 bankruptcy and repay her \noverdue creditors. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that Applicant has \nmade any payments on her student loans from 2008 until 2015. She has shown a \npattern of financial irresponsibility. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the \nGovernment. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant obtained her undergraduate and graduate degrees. She worked for \nabout 20 years for one institution. She has had various jobs. She has been employed \nwith her current employer since July 2019. On balance, Applicant did not produce \ninformation sufficient to mitigate the security concerns about her finances. She has \nshown a pattern of misuse of the bankruptcy process for many years. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with some questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Based upon a review of the pleadings, the documentary evidence, \nand the testimony, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 3, 2019, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking a clearance. On October 27, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). The CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative decisions within DoD on or after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 22, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer). He requested \na hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On March 4, 2021, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 29, 2021, scheduling the hearing on April 9, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented three \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. GE 1 and 3 were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant objected to that admission of GE 2, a report of \nsummarizing his background interview on November 25, 2019. Since the exhibit was not \nauthenticated by a Government witness as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, I sustained \nApplicant\u2019s objection. During Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Applicant, \nApplicant testified that the details of his interview in the report were accurate on all but \nthree specific points. I have given Applicant\u2019s testimony on the accuracy of the facts \nrecited in GE 2 and his corrections and updates appropriate weight in my findings of fact, \nbelow. I did not change my earlier ruling regarding the inadmissibility of GE 2. (Tr. at 9-\n11, 36-37.) \nApplicant attached 12 exhibits to his Answer. I marked the documents as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through L. In addition, Applicant offered two exhibits at the hearing, which \nI marked as AE M and N.

This company sponsored Applicant for his first security \nclearance, and shortly after beginning this job, he submitted his SCA. (Tr. at 13-14, 30, \n39-40.) \nDrug Involvement \nApplicant testified that he never used any illegal drugs or misused any prescription \nmedications of third parties during his high school or college years. In his SCA, he \ndisclosed multiple instances of illegal drug use commencing in December 2012 when he \nwas 27 years old and ending in July 2019 when he was 34. He began working at his \nsecond post-college job in August 2011. All of his illegal drug use occurred during the \nperiod he was employed by this company.

(Tr. at 15, 20-21, 32-37, 39-40; GE 1 at 14, \n54-57; GE 3 at 1-4.) \nNotwithstanding his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy, Applicant began using \ncocaine in December 2012. He used cocaine on about 15 occasions in social settings \nand at home with his girlfriend, who is now his wife. At the hearing, he described the \nfrequency of his cocaine use as two times or less per year for eight years. His last use \nwas July 2019, about one month before he began working for his security clearance \nsponsor. That use occurred at his bachelor\u2019s party prior to his wedding in 2019. Before \nthat, he used cocaine once in September 2018 at a music festival. Most of his cocaine \nuse was during the period 2012 to 2016 in social settings. He testified that cocaine use \nwas common in his local social scene. (Tr. at 15, 20-21, 32-37, 39-40.) \nIn addition to cocaine, Applicant disclosed in his SCA and testified at the hearing \nthat he had used marijuana on three occasions during the period April 2014 to April or \nJune 2017. He also disclosed and testified that he used ecstasy on four occasions during \nthe period April 2014 to September 2018. He explained in his SCA and at the hearing that \nhis drug use was largely associated with attending music festivals and with three \nindividuals. He no longer associates with those individuals. One was a former roommate \nwho has died. The second was a friend who moved to a different state far from Applicant\u2019s \nhome. The third was a friend with whom Applicant no longer associates due to changes \nApplicant has made in his lifestyle, particularly with respect to drug use. He also testified \nthat he is no longer involved in his local, drug-using social scene. (Tr. at 20-22; GE 1 at \n55-56. \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use, he has also misused prescription \nAdderall belonging to a third party. He wrote in his SCA and testified at the hearing that \nthis illegal drug use occurred on two occasions, in April 2014 and April 2017. He has no \nintention of ever misusing this prescription drug again. (Tr. at 20-21; GE 1 at 57.) \nApplicant testified that he was aware that his illegal drug use was inconsistent with \nthe policies of his second employer where he worked from 2011 to 2019. He knew that \nhe was taking a risk that he might fail a random drug test required by the employer or if \nhe was arrested for possession of an illegal drug. (Tr. at 35-37.) \nSince Applicant began his new job with his DoD contractor in August 2019, he has \ncommitted to making changes and living a drug-free lifestyle. His employer drug-tested \nhim before he began his job. He has not used any illegal drugs since August 2019. He \noffered into evidence three negative drug-test reports that were taken over the last four \nmonths. In December 2020, Applicant also voluntarily attended an eight-hour drug and \nalcohol awareness class. In his Answer, he provided a signed statement in which he wrote \nthat he had no intention to ever use illegal drugs again and acknowledged that any future \ndrug use would be grounds for the automatic revocation of his security clearance \neligibility.

(Answer at 8; Tr. at \n23, 39-40; AE K - N.) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf as a character witness and about his past \ndrug use. She said that she was aware of her husband\u2019s drug use. She learned about this \nbehavior from Applicant after he spent time with his friends. She does not believe that her \nhusband\u2019s past drug use ever affected his professional or personal life in any way. She \nadmitted that the two of them have also used cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana together \non rare occasions. The last time they used any illegal drugs was in 2017. She testified \nthat since Applicant began his current job, he has taken his career more seriously. Around \nthe same time, they also became engaged. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he works from \nhome and she sees first-hand how hard he works to perform well in his job. She views \nApplicant as honest and trustworthy. She noted that she is presently a student and is not \nemployed. As a result, she is relying solely on her husband to support her financially. She \nbelieves he is sincere about his decision to live a drug-free lifestyle and is firmly committed \nto this change in his life. (Tr. at 13-19.) \nApplicant also offered ten character reference letters. Six of the letters are personal \nreferences from friends, including his wife, who are aware of Applicant\u2019s past drug use. \nThe other four letters are professional references. These individuals are unaware of \nApplicant\u2019s history of using illegal drugs. His friends describe him as honest, trustworthy, \nreliable, loyal, and dependable. In his youth, he was an Eagle Boy Scout, evidencing his \ncharacter and dedication to hard work. They do not view his past drug use as a habit or \nan abuse. His professional references praise Applicant\u2019s technical skills, dedication, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Significantly, Applicant made a full disclosure of his past \ndrug use in his SCA and during his background interview. (Tr. at 24; AE A-J.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG & 25 contains seven potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. One condition applies to the facts found in this case: \n(a): any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant has used cocaine, ecstasy, \nmarijuana, and a third-party\u2019s prescription Adderall on a number of occasions. His first \nuse of an illegal drug, cocaine, occurred in December 2012. His last use of an illegal drug \nwas also cocaine and that occurred in July 2019, less than two years ago. Accordingly, \nfurther review is required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. Three of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility; and \n(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s last use of cocaine was less than two \nyears ago and was only two or three months before he submitted his October 2019 SCA \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin which he sought eligibility for access to classified information. Insufficient time has \npassed to permit a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s abstinence from using illegal drugs is \nunlikely to recur. Although his drug use could be viewed as somewhat infrequent, his \nrecent behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his past drug use \nand has provided evidence taken to overcome his many years of drug abuse. He no \nlonger associates with friends who use drugs. He also avoids situations where drugs \nmight be used. He has provided a signed statement pursuant to AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). He has \nnot, however, established a pattern of abstinence of sufficient duration to permit a \nconclusion that his drug use will not be repeated. I found his testimony that he no longer \nintends to use illegal drugs to be sincere and credible, but words alone are insufficient \nunder these circumstances. A longer period of abstinence is required to establish full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b). \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s completion of an eight-hour drug and \nalcohol awareness class evidences Applicant\u2019s sincerity in refraining from future illegal \ndrug use. The class, however, does not meet any of the requirements of this mitigating \ncondition. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. I have considered Applicant\u2019s age and the variety of illegal drugs he has used \nsince he was 27 years old. While I have considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s drug use was \nnot a regular part of his lifestyle, I have weighed the fact that he is not someone who \nrecently graduated from college and needed a little time to adjust to adult life where \ncompliance with rules, particularly criminal drug laws, is an important responsibility. This \nfactor imposes a significant burden on Applicant to establish mitigation of the security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns raised by his conduct from age 27 until age 34. Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance at this time. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to satisfy his burden to mitigate security \nconcerns arising from his past drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1. Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the entire record, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/14/2021 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant used marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oil from June 2018 to \nDecember 2018, each drug about ten times a month, in contravention of Federal drug laws \nand his security clearance eligibility. He is currently on two years of deferred adjudication \nwith community supervision for a December 2018 drug possession charge and the \ndisposition of a December 2018 drunk-driving charge is unclear. Reform was not \nsufficiently established of either the drug involvement and substance misuse or the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 2, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Guideline G, alcohol consumption. The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why \nit was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n\n2 \n \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all \nadjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR in which he admitted the \nallegations without comment. He requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On \nDecember 31, 2020, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) \nconsisting of seven exhibits (Ex.), which included the SOR as Ex. 1 and his SOR response \nas Ex. 2. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on January 6, 2021, and \ninstructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the \nFORM on January 28, 2021. No response was received by the February 27, 2021 \ndeadline.  \n \nOn March 25, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on April 2, 2021. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used THC extract oil (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand cannabis (SOR \u00b6 1.b) approximately ten times a month each from June 2018 to about \nDecember 2018 while  granted access to classified information, and that he was arrested in \nDecember 2018 and charged with felony possession of a controlled substance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in December 2018 and \ncharged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) (SOR \u00b6 2.a). When he responded to the SOR, \nhe admitted all of the allegations without comment. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted \nand incorporated as factual findings. After considering Exhibits 1 through 7 in the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, married, and has a 20-year-old son and three daughters, \nages 23, 21, and 17. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering and has \nworked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since September 1999. Applicant \nreports that he was granted a DOD secret clearance in February 2005. (Ex. 3.) \nGovernment records show he was granted a DOD secret clearance most recently in \nOctober 2009. (Ex. 6.) \n \n \n Applicant consumed five to six glasses of wine at a concert on December 20, 2018. \nIn route home, he was stopped for weaving. He failed a field sobriety test and also a \nbreathalyzer test, which showed a blood-alcohol level of .12%. Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with DWI and with possession of a controlled substance after an electronic \ncigarette containing THC extract was found in his vehicle. (Ex. 4.)  \n \n \nOn July 15, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed in response to police \nrecord inquires his arrest in December 2018 on pending charges of misdemeanor DWI and \n\n3 \n \nfelony possession of a controlled substance (cannabis or THC extract). In response to an \ninquiry into whether he had illegally used any drug in the last seven years, Applicant \nreported that he used \u201ccannabis or THC extract\u201d by smoking vapor 20 times per month \nbetween June 2018 and December 2018. He responded affirmatively to whether his use \noccurred while possessing a security clearance but also indicated that he did not intend to \nuse cannabis or THC extract in the future \u201cfor family, health and legal reasons.\u201d Applicant \ndisclosed in a separate entry that he used \u201cTHC oil\u201d ten times from June 2017 to \nDecember 2018, while possessing a security clearance. (Ex. 3.) On August 8, 2019, a \ngrand jury indicted Applicant for felony possession of THC in amount of less than one gram \nfor the THC found in his vehicle on December 20, 2018. (Ex. 4)  \n \n \n On October 22, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he had not yet appeared in \ncourt for his December 2018 DWI. He described his then current consumption of alcohol \nas two or three glasses of wine two or three times a week to relax or for social reasons. He \nadmitted that he had consumed more alcohol than he should have at the concert, but at \nthe time, he did not believe that his alcohol consumption was a problem. Applicant stated \nthat a friend, who lives in a state where recreational marijuana use is legal, had given him \nthe electronic cigarette containing THC extract which was found during the search of his \nvehicle incident to his December 2018 DWI arrest. Applicant related that he used THC to \nrelax in his home, five to ten times a month from June 2018 to December 2018, while he \nheld a security clearance. He denied any use of THC since then and any intent to use the \ndrug in the future. (Ex. 4.) \n \n \nApplicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator on January 8, 2020, to \nprovide an update about the status of his pending misdemeanor DWI and felony drug \npossession offenses. He stated that he had rejected the first plea bargain of the \nprosecution on the drug charge but did not elaborate as to its terms. He had yet to appear \nin court on the DWI charge because the county wanted to close the felony drug case first. \nRegarding his drinking, Applicant volunteered for the first time that his alcohol consumption \nhad a negative impact on him from January 2014 to December 2018. He did not give a \nreason for his increased alcohol consumption during that time but admitted that it caused \nhim marital difficulties. He denied any consumption of alcohol since December 2018. (Ex. \n4.) \n \n \nOn March 3, 2020, Applicant pled guilty to a negotiated charge of misdemeanor \npossession of a controlled substance \u2014 THC less than one gram. He was placed on \ndeferred adjudication for 24 months with community supervision for two years, fined $1,500 \nplus costs for a total of $3,295, and ordered to submit to random hair follicle drug testing, \ncomplete 40 hours of community service, and attend a drug offender education program. \n(Ex. 4; Ex. 5.) As of May 20, 2020, Applicant had yet to pay $3,173 of the financial \nassessment for the drug offense. (Ex. 5.) The state where Applicant was arrested allows \nfor community supervision by a court under a continuum of programs and sanctions with \nconditions imposed for a specific period during which criminal proceedings are deferred \nwithout an adjudication of guilt, or where a sentence of imprisonment or confinement, \n\n4 \n \nimprisonment and fine, or confinement and fine, is probated and the imposition of sentence \nis suspended in whole or in part. See Chapter 42A Tex. Code Crim. Proc. \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated on August 19, 2020, that he \nwas currently on \u201cprobation with [a] community supervision officer\u201d for the deferred Class A \nmisdemeanor drug possession charge, and was scheduled to plead in court for the DUI on \nSeptember 10, 2020. Relevant court records confirm that court date. In response to a \nDOHA interrogatory into whether he had ever used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, \nhallucinogen, or cannabis or misused any prescription medication, Applicant reported that \nuse used marijuana and THC oil, each ten times per month, between June 2018 and \nDecember 2018. He denied any intent to use either drug in the future, stating \u201cNo intention \nto use illegal drugs. Avoid people or places where that takes place.\u201d He responded \nnegatively to a question concerning any participation in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation \nsupport group but affirmatively to a question concerning current participation in a drug \ntesting program. Applicant explained that, as required by his community supervision officer, \nhe was subjected to quarterly hair follicle testing at the probation office. He responded \nnegatively to an inquiry concerning any current consumption of alcohol, stating that he last \nused alcohol on the day of his December 2018 arrest for DWI, and he denied any intent to \nconsume alcohol in the future. As to the next step in the judicial process for his DWI, \nApplicant responded, \u201cPlead Guilty in Court on Sept. 10, 2020.\u201d He denied any other \nalcohol-related incidents (Ex.4), and there is no evidence to the contrary shown on \navailable criminal records, including from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). (Ex. 7.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \n\n5 \n \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nDespite some states\u2019 legalization or decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana \nfor recreational use, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance, and its use is \nillegal under Federal law and contrary to the obligations of security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant indicated on his SF 86 that he used marijuana or THC extract by smoking vapor \n(vaping) \u201cmonthly, 20 times\u201d between June 2018 and December 2018. He separately listed \nuse of THC oil ten times between June 2017 and December 2018. While it is unclear \nwhether the June 2017 date for first use of THC oil is a typographical error, the DCSA CAF \nalleged use of THC extract oil ten times per month from June 2018 to December 2018 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). During his October 2019 OPM interview, Applicant minimized his THC use in \nthat he stated that he used THC five to ten times a month over the six months. In his \nAugust 2020 response to DOHA interrogatories, he reported that he used marijuana and \n\n6 \n \nTHC oil at a frequency of 10 times per month for each substance. The record evidence \nestablishes that he illegally used THC in some form 20 times a month from June 2018 to \nDecember 2018 while he held a secret clearance. When he was arrested for DWI on \nDecember 20, 2018, he had an electronic cigarette containing THC in his possession. He \ntold the OPM investigator that a friend gave him the \u201cE cigarette with THC extract.\u201d The \nrecord does not otherwise reflect how he obtained the THC, including marijuana, which he \nused on a frequent basis over the course of six months in 2018. Nonetheless, his illegal \ndrug involvement establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance \nmisuse;\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia;\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \n \nApplicant knew or can reasonably be held to have known that his marijuana use was \nagainst Federal law, if not also his state\u2019s drug laws, and contrary to the requirements of \nhis security clearance eligibility. While his friend may have acquired the vaping pen with \nTHC legally in the friend\u2019s state, as evidenced by the illegal possession charge against \nApplicant, it was not legal of be in possession of THC in Applicant\u2019s state. Applicant had \nbeen working for his defense-contractor employer since 1999 and held a secret clearance \nsince at least 2009 if not earlier.  He did not present any evidence of his employer\u2019s policy \nregarding the use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s decision to forego future marijuana use, which \nhe expressed on his SF 86, during his October 2019 OPM interview, and in response to \nDOHA interrogatories, is viewed favorably, but it does not necessarily dispel the security \nconcerns raised by his drug involvement in contravention of Federal and his state\u2019s laws \nand the requirements of his security clearance. \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n\n7 \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation. Applicant\u2019s THC involvement from \nJune 2018 to December 2018 is considered recent as of his July 2019 SF 86. At 20 times a \nmonth, it was frequent during the time frame that he used it. Neither AG \u00b6 26(c) nor AG \u00b6 \n26(d) was shown to apply. AG \u00b6 26(b) (3) is not fully established, despite his repeated \ndenials of any intent to use THC in the future. It is not enough in reform that he is currently \navoiding persons who may use illegal drugs. He admitted during his October 2019 OPM \ninterview that he used THC to relax while he was at home. He was in his mid-50s when he \nused THC, and he held a DOD clearance. The circumstances of his illegal drug \ninvolvement raise serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nMoreover, it would be premature to find that he is fully reformed of his illegal drug \ninvolvement at this juncture. He is still on community supervision for his illegal drug \npossession offense committed in December 2018 and subject to drug testing. He presently \nhas every motivation to avoid use of any THC because he would jeopardize his deferred \nadjudication status if found to have used or possessed an illegal drug. Moreover, he has \nyet to pay all the fines and costs assessed for his illegal drug possession. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s December 2018 DWI offense with a blood-alcohol level of .12% is \nevidence of abusive drinking under AG \u00b6 22(a), which provides: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nOn that occasion, Applicant consumed five to six glasses of wine at a concert. \nApplicant told the OPM investigator in October 2019 that he did not think his drinking was a \nproblem at that time, but given the quantity consumed and his blood-alcohol level, it could \nbe considered an episode of binge drinking under AG \u00b6 22(c), which states: \n\n8 \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \n \n \nThe term \u201cbinge\u201d drinking is not defined in the Directive. The generally accepted \ndefinition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks in about two \nhours. This definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on Alcohol \nAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, NIAAA Newsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), \nhttp://www.pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/winter2004/NewsletterNumber3.pdf. \nEven so, the evidence of excessive consumption that would trigger AG \u00b6 22(c) is otherwise \nlimited. During his October 2019 OPM interview, Applicant gave the impression that his \nexcessive drinking at the concert was situational and not reflective of his drinking pattern at \nthe time. He said that he drank two or three glasses of wine two to three times a week. \nWhen re-interviewed in January 2020, Applicant indicated that alcohol had a negative \nimpact on him from January 2014 to December 2018. He did not give a reason for his \nincreased alcohol consumption during that time but admitted that it caused him marital \ndifficulties. However, without more detail about his drinking habits during that time, I cannot \nfind that he engaged in habitual or binge drinking beyond the DWI incident. \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 have some applicability. They are: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI was an isolated incident and therefore \u201cso infrequent\u201d under AG \u00b6 \n23(a). That being said, it was recent enough to cause some concerns about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and especially his judgment. As of Applicant\u2019s August 2020 \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, he had yet to appear in court. He apparently planned to \nplead guilty on September 10, 2020, but he presented no evidence of such a plea or of a \nfinal disposition for the charge even though he had an opportunity to update the record \ninformation in rebuttal to the FORM. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is partially established in that Applicant has been abstinent from alcohol \nsince his arrest for DWI on December 20, 2018. He has not had any counseling, although it \nis not required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b) provided he takes other actions, such as \nmoderating or eliminated consumption of alcohol, to avoid a recurrence of abusive drinking. \nHowever, it is difficult to conclude that Applicant is fully rehabilitated without knowing the \n\n9 \n \nterms of his sentence, if any, for the DWI and whether he is in compliance with any \nsentence imposed. Based on the record before me, the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns are only partially mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use raises serious concerns about his ability and willingness \nto abide by his security clearance obligations. It occurred when he was in his mid-50s, so \nimmaturity is no excuse. He clearly enjoyed the relaxing effects of THC, and it is not clear \nthat he would have ceased his drug involvement in December 2018 had he not been \ncaught with a THC-infused E-cigarette and charged with felony possession. It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The Government must be able to rely on \nthose persons granted security clearance eligibility to fulfill their responsibilities consistent \nwith laws, regulations, and policies. For the reasons previously discussed, doubts persist \nas to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He has been serving \nas an operations teleworker with his current sponsor since sometime after he submitted \nhis SF 86 in April 2018. He is also serving as an enlisted member of the U.S. Army \nReserve. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010.

Upon his discharge from active duty, he continued his service \nin the inactive reserve. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, for in his \nSF 86 he indicated that he had undergone an investigation for a secret clearance, but did \nnot state that one had been awarded to him.

It is unclear what factors led to his \nfinancial difficulties as he did not specify any factors except that when he left active duty, \nhe was living on a fixed income from the reserves and his U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) disability. He stopped paying on his loans, and other than attempting to have \nhis student loans placed on hold, he had not made any attempts to pay them. In June \n2018, when he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), he characterized his finances as not currently in a good state. (Item \n3, at 7) He claimed to be embarrassed by having delinquent accounts, and the degree of \nembarrassment was such that he had not told his wife of their financial situation. He \nplanned to tell her \u201csoon\u201d and intended to seek financial counseling. (Item 3, at 8) \nApplicant did not subsequently indicate if he had finally told his wife of his financial \nsituation. He also did not state that he had obtained financial counseling. \nAs of June 2020, when he submitted his answers to the interrogatories, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had not paid, did not have any payment arrangements, and that \nhe was not making payments on two student loans that were in collection. A third account \nwas charged off. (Item 4, at 4). He added that since he had no contact information for the \ncreditor holding two of the accounts, he was unable to contact them, so he turned to \ndisputing the accounts with Credit Karma. (Item 4, at 6) It should be noted that the mailing \naddress and telephone number of the creditor are listed in his two 2019 credit reports. \nApplicant failed to submit any documentation to support his contention that he had \ndisputed the accounts, and he failed to furnish a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the two delinquent accounts. \nOn March 6, 2020, along with his responses to the interrogatories, Applicant \ncompleted a Personal Financial Statement in which he reported $3,470 in current net \nmonthly income, including his $1,000 VA disability compensation; $1,750 in monthly \nexpenses; student-loan debts (claimed to be on an income-based repayment plan) \ntotaling $87,992 with a scheduled monthly payment of $1,000, but an actual payment of \nzero; leaving a monthly remainder of $1,720 available for discretionary spending or \nsavings. He claimed to have $17,460 in bank savings. (Item 4). He failed to submit any \ndocumentation to support his contention that the student-loan debts were on an income-\nbased repayment plan. \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $52,406, as set \nforth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a student-loan account from a bank with an unpaid balance of \n$11,753 that was charged off. (Item 5, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthat the account had been charged off, but denied that as of the date the SOR was issued, \nit was still delinquent.

(Item 5, at 5; Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 7). In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the account had been delinquent, but \ndenied that as of the date the SOR was issued, it was still delinquent. He submitted some \ndocuments reflecting that he had been sued on July 21, 2020, for approximately $20,852, \nincluding accrued interest; Applicant paid $18,700 on August 28, 2020; and that the suit \nwas dismissed with prejudice on September 3, 2020. (Documents attached to Answer to \nthe SOR). The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a federal student-loan account with an unpaid balance of $22,852 \nthat was placed for collection and transferred. (Item 5, at 5; Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 7). In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the account had been delinquent, but \ndenied that as of the date the SOR was issued, it was still delinquent. He submitted some \ndocuments reflecting that he had been sued on July 21, 2020, for approximately $26,332, \nincluding accrued interest; Applicant paid the $18,700 noted above; and that the suit was \ndismissed with prejudice on September 10, 2020. (Documents attached to Answer to the \nSOR). The account has been resolved. \nIt is noted that despite Applicant\u2019s claimed inability to maintain the accounts \nalleged in the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, or a choice \nnot to do so, his March 2020 Personal Financial Statement reported a monthly remainder \nof $1,720 available for discretionary spending or savings. And, he claimed to have \n$17,460 in bank savings. He offered no explanation regarding the source of the funds \nused to resolve the three SOR-alleged delinquent debts. \nFurthermore, there is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or a current \nPersonal Financial Statement. Accordingly, it is difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.

In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$52,406. When Applicant left active duty in July 2017, he was living on a fixed income \nfrom the reserves and his VA disability. He stopped paying on his loans, and until \nSeptember 2020, he did not make any attempts to pay them. In June 2018, he \ncharacterized his finances as not currently in a good state. It appears that he was unwilling \nto satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, especially when he had a monthly \nremainder of $1,750 in March 2020. Furthermore, as noted above, it remains unclear if \nthe source of the funds he used to eventually resolve his delinquent accounts was \nsavings, another commercial loan, or a private loan. If it was another loan, that simply \nchanges the identity of the creditors. The uncertainty leads to a conclusion that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) partially or minimally apply, but none of the other conditions \napply. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant claimed to be so embarrassed by having \ndelinquent accounts that he had not told his wife of their financial situation. He planned \nto tell her \u201csoon\u201d and intended to seek financial counseling. It remains unclear if he did \neither. Based on the evidence, it appears that Applicant ignored his delinquent accounts \nfor approximately two and one-half years after he was questioned by the OPM \ninvestigator. He waited approximately seven months after he was issued a set of \ninterrogatories regarding his delinquent student-loan accounts. Only then, three months \nbefore the SOR was issued, did he take action to resolve the delinquent accounts, \nbasically at a substantial discount. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial \nproblems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy \nmay be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over \ntime or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. \nBd.

They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant finally resolved all \nthree of the accounts alleged in the SOR. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until substantial investigatory \naction was taken, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. \nThe timeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay in commencing \nto do so, is another negative factor. The subsequent positive and successful efforts are \ngood. However, the source of the funds he used to resolve his delinquent accounts is still \nshrouded in mystery. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s delayed actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \noperations teleworker with his current sponsor since sometime after he submitted his SF \n86 in April 2018. He is also serving as an enlisted member of the U.S. Army Reserve. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. He previously served on active duty with the U.S. \nArmy from March 2011 until July 2017, when he was honorably discharged as a sergeant \n(E-5). During his period of active duty, he was deployed on two occasions: to Afghanistan \nfrom April 2013 until December 2013; and to South Korea from March 2016 until October \n2016. Upon his discharge from active duty, he continued his service in the inactive \nreserve. Applicant finally, after a multi-year delay, resolved his three delinquent student-\nloan accounts three months before the SOR was issued. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant had three delinquent student-loan accounts totaling \napproximately $52,406. When he left active duty, he was living on a fixed income from \nthe reserves and his VA disability. He stopped paying on his loans, and until September \n2020, he did not make any attempts to pay them. In June 2018, he characterized his \nfinances as not currently in a good state. He claimed to be so embarrassed by having \ndelinquent accounts that he had not told his wife of their financial situation \u2013 a potential \ntrigger to blackmail. He planned to tell her \u201csoon\u201d and intended to seek financial \ncounseling. It remains unclear if he did either. Three months before the SOR was issued, \nbut approximately two and one-half years after he was questioned by the OPM \ninvestigator, and approximately seven months after he was issued a set of interrogatories \nregarding his delinquent student-loan accounts, Applicant finally addressed those \ndelinquent accounts. Because he failed to offer sufficient information and commentary \nregarding his current finances; the reason why he failed to contact his creditors for such \na lengthy period; the reason why he failed to make even minimum payments, especially \nwhen he had a monthly remainder of $1,750 as far back as March 2020, and possibly \neven before that time; as well as the source of the funds he used to resolve the three \ndelinquent debts, there are lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfinancially than he had been, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nWhile the eventual result with respect to the three alleged delinquent student-loan \naccounts is good, Applicant\u2019s track record of zero efforts to resolve the debts, the lengthy \nperiod of non-contact with his creditors, and complete non-payment until September \n2020, is negative and disappointing. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She indicated that she did not understand the full \nramifications of her marijuana use. She thought the most important thing was to be \nhonest about her marijuana use, which she was.

(AE A, C, G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nApplicant lived in a world where marijuana was so common and accepted that \nOprah Winfrey\u2019s magazine questioned whether it was the \u201cnew merlot.\u201d She used it \nsporadically over the years, but experienced little effect from it. She did not think much \nof it, even after she submitted a security clearance application and was interviewed for \nher background investigation. She thought the most important thing in pursuing a \nsecurity clearance was to be honest about her marijuana use, which she was. \nApplicant now completely realizes that marijuana use is against federal law, not \nresponsible conduct, and inconsistent with holding a security clearance. She credibly \ntestified that she will not use illegal drugs in the future. She fully disclosed her drug use \non her SF 86 and throughout the security clearance proceedings, which bolsters her \ncredibility. Applicant\u2019s conduct no longer casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an \nappropriate period, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

(Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) \nApplicant joined the U.S. Army right after graduating from high school in 2008. In \nthe Army, she worked as a Unit Supply Specialist, and held a security clearance without \nincident. She separated and received an honorable discharge in April 2013. In May \n2013, she joined the Army reserves and to finish her contract she served in that \ncapacity until February 2017.

She does not spend irresponsibly or extravagantly. She seems to be fairly \nfrugal with her money, but finds that being a single parent is expensive. She stated that \nat times she has had to choose between paying a bill or feeding her son. Being \nresponsible for paying all of her living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, her car \npayment, gas, and insurance, as well as providing for her son\u2019s needs by herself, has \nnot been easy. Applicant also added that she is living in a state with a high cost of \nliving, and many jobs do not compensate their workers accordingly. She explained that \nshe was previously on childcare assistance and when she got an increase in pay, she \nwas told that she made too much money and had to repay $1,100. At that time, she did \nnot qualify for food stamps or medicaid because of her pay raises. With the pay raises, \nshe still did not have enough money to pay all of her bills and provide for the things her \nson needed. She states that she does not receive much in child support, and her son\u2019s \nfather is not a figure in his life. \nTo subsidize her income, Applicant works as a \nhousekeeper for a friend. Applicant has been focusing on bringing her car payment \ncurrent, and paying her rent. (Tr. pp. 21-28.) \nApplicant began working for her employer in her current position in July 2017. \nWith this job, she had planned on resolving her delinquent debt. Since Covid, however, \nin addition to her young son, her siblings have moved in with her, as they no longer \nhave jobs, and are dependent on her. Applicant now pays the rent, utilities, her car \npayment, food, and other bills so that they all have a roof over their heads. Applicant \nstates that she does not gamble, drink, or use illicit drugs. She further states that she is \nof sound mind and very responsible. She will never under any circumstances be \ntempted to commit any crime. She states that she is simply trying to be the best mother \nthat she can be. Applicant also alluded to a health problem that she is either currently \nsuffering from or has been dealing with in some respect. She did not go into detail. (Tr. \np. 25 and 35.) \nThe following debts set forth in the SOR became delinquent and owing: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a bank for a vehicle she purchased.  The loan account was \npast due in the amount of $302, with an outstanding balance of $9,465.  Applicant \ntestified that it was behind at that time, but she has since brought the loan current.  (Tr. \np. 24.)  There is no documentary evidence in the record to show that she has brought \nthis debt current.  Applicant states that the bank is sending her something to update the \nstatus of the debt, but she has yet to receive it.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nThe debt remains owing.                     \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $2,436.  She plans to contact the creditor next month to start \nworking to resolve the debt.

Applicant has not spoken to the \ncreditor for several years.  (Tr. p. 29.)  The debt remains owing.       \n1.f.  Applicant is indebted to a bank for a personal loan she obtained to purchase tires \nfor her car and make necessary car repairs.  The account was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $2,779.   Applicant stated that she planned to start paying \nthis off after she got her car payment caught up.  (Tr. p\n . 30.)  She recently contacted the \nbank to obtain information about her options.  She has yet to receive this \ndocumentation.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)  The debt remains owing. \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for cell phone service she had while on active \nduty.  Applicant also had a few of her family members on this account.  The account \nwas placed for collection in the approximate amount of $3,019.   (Tr. pp. 30-31.)  The \ndebt remains owing.             \n1.h.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a credit card account that was placed for\ncollection in the approximate amount of $625.    Applicant closed the credit card and\nowed about $300 or $400, which was the credit limit.  She did not realize that it was still\nacquiring interest on the card even after she closed the card.  She spoke to the creditor\nearlier this year, and they were sending her a payment arrangement or settlement\npackage to complete.  She did not receive the package and has not followed up.

Applicant is indebted to a military credit card for an account that was placed for\ncollection in the approximate amount of $692.

She contacted customer service about this\nand they told her to go to the military store to make a payment because she was unable\nto make a payment over the phone.  She sent an e-mail about this to customer service\nbut she has not heard back.  (Tr. p. 33.)  The debt remains owing.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.j.

(Tr. p. 35 - 40.) \nA letter of recommendation from a Coding Compliance Specialist, dated August \n25, 2021, who works with the Applicant, states that she has found Applicant to be \nextremely helpful and knowledgeable in her area of expertise. Applicant is said to \nconsistently provide valuable instruction and insight to others. In the writer\u2019s opinion, \nApplicant is very hardworking and has shown aptitude in critical thinking and the ability \nto analyze a situation and properly resolve the issue. The writer considers the Applicant \nto be one of the best sustainment trainers they have on the job. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit A.) \nAn email letter of appreciation from a contractor, generated on January 8, 2021, \nexpresses how valuable Applicant has been to their mission. Applicant has excellent \ncustomer service skills and she is considered an absolute standout among the others.  \nShe is said to be logical and smart in her approach to problem solving, and she has \nbeen able to identify solutions quickly and confidently. Others depend on her to solve \ntheir problems and she does so when others are unable to. Applicant is considered to \nbe a real asset to the team.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nAn email letter of appreciation from a contractor dated July 7, 2021, indicates that \nApplicant was asked to train someone with a disability, and her approach was very \npatient, thorough and kind. She displayed excellent customer service skills. She went \nabove and beyond in providing her training service and is greatly appreciated for her \nservice. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nApplicant stated that she recently contacted the Veteran\u2019s Administration and \nmade an appointment with a social worker to help her find a financial advisor to assist in \ngetting her delinquent debts resolved. Because Applicant was recently exposed to \nCovid, her supervisor told her to quarantine and get tested.  This caused her to miss her \nappointment with the social worker, but Applicant plans to reschedule her meeting soon. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial distress. She is excessively indebted to a \nnumber of creditors totaling approximately $30,000. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIt is acknowledged that Applicant has had a tough time with living in a high-cost \nof living area, limited income, and the expenses of raising a son on her own. She also \nincurred more expense when her siblings, who are now unemployed, moved in with her.  \nThese circumstances were admittedly beyond her control and have obviously caused \nadditional financial strain, hindering her ability to pay her delinquent debt. However, \nsince July 2017, Applicant has been working full time for her current employer. She has \nbeen an outstanding employee on the job but has done little in the way of showing that \nshe can resolve her delinquent debts. In fact, she has not shown that she has even set \nup payment plans with the creditors, nor has she shown any real effort to contact her \ncreditors to resolve her debt. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKnowing that the Government was concerned about her excessive financial \nindebtedness, she has not demonstrated a good-faith effort to take control of her \nfinancial affairs. \nAll of the delinquent debt set forth in the SOR remains owing. \nApplicant has not demonstrated sufficient responsibility toward her delinquent debt. In \nthis case, none of the mitigating conditions are applicable. The record fails to establish \nsufficient mitigation of financial trustworthiness concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) through 20(g). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, \nwho has failed to demonstrate that she can live within her means, budget her income \naccordingly, and pay her bills in a timely fashion. At this point, her financial problems \ncontinue as there is no evidence that they have been resolved. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a public trust position. She has not met her \nburden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under the guideline for Financial \nConsiderations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue national security \neligibility for a public trust position for the Applicant. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Although the investigative report notes that Applicant is beginning \npayment arrangements, or made payments for the tax liens, he provided no \ndocumentation. He also noted that some accounts had been paid in full. (GE 11) At the \nhearing, he admitted that he had not made any payments. (Tr. 68) He notes that his \ncurrent bills are paid on time. \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement on May 26, 2020. (GE 7) His \ngross salary per year is $43,000. His monthly net is approximately $2,400. His domestic \npartner earns around $3,500 a month. Child support is taken from his paycheck. His family \nmembers sometimes help with bills. (Tr. 88) \nPersonal Conduct. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.a, on February 23, 2018, Applicant had a domestic order entered \nagainst him for a one-year period. He admitted this allegation. He attended the court \nhearing on that date. He stated that the Judge started discussing child custody issues \nand would not let him speak.

He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 concerning \nbills or debts turned over for collection accounts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n4 \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19 (f) (failure to file or \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are long-standing and he acknowledged that he had has not \nprovided evidence of payment or payment plans for any of the delinquent debts. He relied \non the fact that some accounts were not on the credit report, but he also stated that he \nhad never paid them and that they were old. He did have a back injury in 2013, but he \nreceived unemployment benefits. He had worked as a private security guard and switched \nfields recently to a lower paying job. He did not seek financial counseling, nor did he \nadhere to a consolidation plan that he had started a few years ago. He provided no proof \nthat he disputed some accounts. He has not acted responsibly. The other issue is one of \nnot filing federal or state tax returns for many years. He does not know how much he may \nowe in taxes. He chose to change fields of work and is employed. AG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nare not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved and he provided no \nplan or proof of payment. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling nor are there clear indications that his financial situation is under control. As \nto the failure to pay federal and state income taxes from 2011 to 2018, Applicant provided \nno credible explanation. He has not yet established a payment plan with the IRS. His \nfinancial problems are not under control. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the \nGovernment. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t against Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged admitted deliberate falsification of his 2018 SF85P, 2019, \nSCA, and 2019 non-disclosure of failure to file or pay federal or state taxes for the above-\nmentioned years, the following condition applies. \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted that he had a domestic violence order entered against him on \nFebruary 23, 2018, but did not disclose it on his SF85P. He volunteered that he did not \nfile \ntaxes, \nfederal \nor \nstate \nfor \nmany \nyears \nwithout \nexplanation. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove a falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission.1 An applicant\u2019s level of education and business experience are \nrelevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on an SCA was \n2 \ndeliberate. \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments at the hearing that he knew \nthat he did not file or pay his federal or state income taxes for some years. He also knew \nthat he had a domestic protective order and provided no credible explanation as to why \nhe thought it was dismissed. I find that Applicant intentionally falsified material information \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n2 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including his lack of credibility and openness at the \nhearing, I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified the various forms alleged in the \nSOR. He also has unresolved delinquent debts that he admits he has never paid. \nApplicant also has not filed federal or state taxes for many years. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2:d: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on July 20, 2021. \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through Q, which were \nadmitted without objection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. Without objection, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the requests. The pertinent facts are \nsummarized in the written requests and fact sheets and will not be repeated verbatim \nhere. Of note is that China is an authoritarian state dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party, with a poor record with respect to human rights. Taiwan is a \ndemocracy. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. \nHowever, the United States does not support Taiwan independence from China. \nThe United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese \nintelligence operations. China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected \ninformation and Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic \nespionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that \nhave sensitive military applications. Numerous cases have arisen involving the illegal \nexport or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 24-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor since \n2019. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, which he earned in 2019. He is single without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16-\n18; GE 1, 2; AE E, N) \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth. He was born in Taiwan to an American father \nand a Taiwanese mother. His parents are professionals; they both had jobs in Taiwan; \nand Applicant was educated through high school in Taiwan. Applicant moved to the \nUnited States in 2015 to attend college. His father moved back to the United States at \nabout the same time. (Tr. at 16-19, 42-43, 52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s mother remained in Taiwan as a citizen and resident. She worked for \na period for a banking and financial company that was incorporated in China. Her duties \nrequired her to travel periodically to China, and she would stay there for extended \nperiods. She left that employment and returned to Taiwan, where she works for a \ndifferent financial company that was founded in the United States, but now operates \ninternationally. Applicant\u2019s father is sponsoring her to immigrate to the United States. \nThe immigration petition is pending. (Tr. at 21-25, 50-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 2; AE C, P) \nApplicant has an older half-brother on his father\u2019s side who was born in Taiwan, \nbut is a citizen and resident of the United States. Applicant\u2019s maternal grandfather is a \ncitizen and resident of Taiwan. His maternal grandmother is a dual citizen of the United \nStates and Taiwan and a resident of Taiwan. His uncle is a dual citizen of the United \nStates and Taiwan and a resident of Taiwan. His uncle completed mandatory service in \nthe Taiwan military when he was younger. None of the above family in Taiwan have any \ndirect ties to the Taiwanese government.

He worked \nwith Applicant\u2019s mother, and Applicant became friendly with his son. The family friend \nworks for a banking and financial company. He completed mandatory service in the \nTaiwan military when he was younger. He does not have any direct ties to the \nTaiwanese government. (Tr. at 28-30, 46, 58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nWhen Applicant was in college, his family friend helped Applicant receive an \nunpaid internship at the financial company where he worked over the winter break in \nDecember 2016 to 2017. He helped Applicant receive another internship at an airline in \nTaiwan during part of the summer of 2018. Applicant had another internship at an \naviation company in Taiwan in the summer of 2018. (Tr. at 34-37, 47; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s parents gave him monetary gifts over the years. The money was \nmaintained in a bank in Taiwan. The accounts grew to the equivalent of about $100,000 \nin U.S. currency. Applicant, with his mother\u2019s assistance, has been moving the funds to \na U.S. account. The Taiwanese accounts now have the equivalent of about $3,000. \nApplicant intends to close the accounts the next time he is in Taiwan. He does not own \nany other foreign assets. (Tr. at 26-28, 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; \nAE A, B, J) \nApplicant has about $463,000 in his U.S. bank account. Applicant\u2019s father bought \na condominium in the city where Applicant went to college, and placed it in both of their \nnames. They recently sold the condominium. Applicant received $350,000 from the \nsale, which went to his U.S. bank account and was the largest contribution to the \n$463,000 total in that account. (Tr. at 39-40, 44-45; AE I, O) \nApplicant could have become a dual citizen of Taiwan, but he declined to do so. \nHe has been associated with the Boy Scouts of America for much of his life and \nattended summer camps in the United States. He expressed his undivided allegiance to \nthe United States, which he considers his home. He stated: \u201cI\u2019ve grown up American \nand I will remain American until the day I die.\u201d He credibly testified that his family, \nfriends, and assets in Taiwan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information. (Tr. at 19-20, 31, 40-41; AE F) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his reliability, judgment, \ndependability, loyalty, work ethic, dedication, and \u201cintense love of the United States.\u201d \n(AE F, L) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, maternal grandfather, and a close family friend are citizens \nand residents of Taiwan. His maternal grandmother and uncle are dual citizens of the \nUnited States and Taiwan and residents of Taiwan. The United States and Taiwan \nenjoy a robust unofficial relationship. However, the United States does not support \nTaiwan independence from China. Taiwan has been an active collector of U.S. \neconomic technologies that have sensitive military applications. Numerous cases have \narisen involving the illegal export or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology \nto Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s family and friend in Taiwan create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s bank accounts in Taiwan would have established AG \u00b6 7(f) when he \nhad about $100,000 in them. The accounts have been reduced to about $3,000, which \nis not a significant financial interest that could subject him to a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest. AG \u00b6 7(f) is not applicable.

SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who turned down every opportunity to become a \ndual citizen of Taiwan. He has been associated with the Boy Scouts of America for \nmuch of his life and attended summer camps in the United States. He moved to the \nUnited States in 2015 to attend college and remained. He expressed his undivided \nallegiance to the United States, which he considers his home. His father is in the United \nStates and is petitioning for his mother to immigrate to the United States. Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstated: \u201cI\u2019ve grown up American and I will remain American until the day I die.\u201d He \ncredibly testified that his family, friend, and assets in Taiwan could not be used to \ncoerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.  \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan are outweighed by his deep and long\u00ad\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely Applicant will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of Taiwan. There is no conflict of interest, because Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and \n8(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

After reviewing the information \ngathered during the background investigation, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on October 30, 2020, alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct).

Applicant received the FORM on March 3, 2021. She was granted a \nperiod of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the FORM and \nto provide material to refute, extenuate, and mitigate the concerns. Applicant responded \nto the FORM by email dated, March 23, 2021. The case was assigned to me on May \n17, 2021. \nProcedural Issue \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included an \nunauthenticated summary of her interview with a government background investigator \non December 20, 2019. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant was informed she could object to the \nsummary of her interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or that she could \nmake corrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make it accurate. \nApplicant was informed that her failure to respond to the FORM or to raise any \nobjections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence would be \nconsidered. \nApplicant responded to the FORM, but submitted no documentary evidence, and \nraised no objections to the FORM or to me considering the unauthenticated summary of \nher December 2019 interview. Without objections, I admitted and considered all of the \nFORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. The admitted \nfinancial allegations include a delinquent consumer account in collection for $446 (\u00b6 \n1.a); 12 delinquent medical accounts in collection totaling about $3,732 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through \n1.m); and five student loans in collection totaling about $15,499 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.n through 1.r), all \nof which are also established by the credit reports (FORM Items 6\u20138). Applicant also \nadmitted to falsifying her 2019 SCA in failing to disclose any of her delinquencies. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has never been \nmarried and has no children. She graduated from high school in 2011, and attended two \ndifferent colleges between September 2011 and March 2015; however, she did not earn \na degree. \nApplicant started working for her current employer and clearance sponsor in \nOctober 2019.

(Form, \nItem 5) \nApplicant was employed between March and June 2018; unemployed between \nFebruary and March 2018; and employed between November 2015 and February 2018. \nShe was employed part time between June 2015 and January 2016; and fully employed \nbetween November 13, 2013 and June 2015. She was unemployed while in college \nbetween September 2011 and November 2013. \nSection 26 (Financial Record) of Applicant\u2019s 2019 SCA asked whether in the past \nseven years she had: (1) bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; (2) any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, of cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; \n(3) defaulted on any type of loan; and (4) been over 120 days delinquent on any debt; or \nwas currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to all the \nabove questions and deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent accounts and student \nloans in collection alleged in the SOR. \nDuring her December 2019 interview, Applicant claimed that her failure to list her \nstudent loans was an oversight. She stated she fell behind on her student loans in \n2013-2014, and claimed her mother told her that either she (her mother) or the state \nwould take care of the loans. Applicant averred she discovered her student loans were \ndelinquent and in collection when her income tax refunds were confiscated by the IRS \nto apply the refunds to her student loan debt starting in 2017. \nConcerning the 12 delinquent medical and consumer debt accounts, Applicant \ntold the investigator that her failure to disclose them in the 2019 SCA was an oversight. \nShe stated that she went through a financial hardship and her debts became delinquent. \nApplicant claimed that between 2014 and 2016, she made sporadic payments of $200 \nper month to resolve her medical bills, and she mistakenly believed the medical debts \nhad been satisfied. Applicant presented no documentary evidence of payments made \non any of the accounts alleged in the SOR since the day she acquired the obligations to \nthe day she answered the FORM. \nApplicant stated in her interview and in her answer to the FORM that her financial \nhardship was caused by periods of unemployment. She stated that she was immature \nregarding her finances in 2011-2012, but believed she had become more mature \nfinancially after 2015. Applicant told the investigator that she intended to establish \npayment plans to pay off her debts sometime in the future - when she has funds \navailable to do so. Applicant believes that she lives within her financial means; that she \ncan pay her debts through payment plans; and that her financial situation is stable. \nIn her answer to the FORM, Applicant stated that she did not intend to falsify her \n2019 SCA. She noted that she had been struggling financially and mentally. (She did \nnot explain what her mental struggles are.) Applicant averred she did not know her \nmedical bills were accumulating because she believed her father was paying them or \nher insurance was doing so.

She claimed she was paying $200 a month to a creditor, \nbut failed to submit any documentary evidence of any contact with creditors, of any \npayment plans established, or of any payments made on any of the debts alleged in the \nSOR. \nApplicant did not present evidence of her current financial situation (gross \nmonthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). She did \nnot present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is no evidence to \nshow Applicant has had recent financial counseling. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue her or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by her admissions and the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nI considered the seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20; however, only one is potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nThe AG \u00b6 20(b) financial considerations mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished by the facts in this case and does not mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in about 2012. All of the delinquent accounts \nalleged in the SOR are still ongoing and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s evidence is somewhat \nsufficient to establish that circumstances beyond her control contributed to her financial \nproblems, i.e., her periods of unemployment and her mental struggles. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that she has \nbeen financially responsible under the circumstances. There is no evidence to show that \nshe is following a budget or received recent financial counseling. Applicant submitted no \ndocumented evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve her debts before she submitted \nher 2019 SCA; after she was interviewed by a Government investigator about her \ndelinquencies in 2019; after she received the 2020 SOR; or after she received the \nFORM. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \nApplicant failed to submit documentary evidence of her current financial situation \n(gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder) to \nshow her ability to be financially responsible. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to demonstrate her financial responsibility, that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved, and that she has the financial ability to pay her \ndebts. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nWhen Applicant submitted her 2019 SCA, she knew her student loans were \ndelinquent because the IRS had been confiscating her income tax refunds since 2017. \nConcerning her delinquent medical debts, most of those are for medical services she \nreceived on or after 2017. She failed to present documentary evidence to corroborate \nher claims that she was under her father\u2019s health insurance after she turned 21 year old, \nor that her mother told her she would pay her student loans. Applicant deliberately \nfalsified her 2019 SCA to cover her financial problems. Her lack of candor and \ndishonesty demonstrate questionable judgment, unreliability, and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, establishing the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. Only two of those mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to \nthe facts in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nAfter thorough consideration of the facts, the above mitigating conditions are not \nsupported by the facts in this case and they are not applicable. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to fully establish any mitigating factors under AG \u00b6 17. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment: \nApplicant, 28, has been fully employed with a federal contractor since 2019. Her \nevidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. Moreover, \nshe falsified her 2019 SCA in failing to disclose her financial problems, as required. It is \nwell settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nUnmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead me to conclude that \ngranting a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on April 23, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree (2003), a master\u2019s degree \n(2005), and a Ph.D (2011). He married in 2014. He has two children from the marriage, \nages six and four. He also has twin stepsons who are 14 years old. Applicant testified \nthat he has always treated his stepsons like they were his biological children. He has \nassumed whatever expenses and responsibilities that were necessary for their well-being \nwith little or no financial help from their biological father. One son has special needs. \nApplicant has willingly paid all of the necessary expenses associated with his stepsons\u2019 \nneeds. Although entitled to child support, his wife receives sporadic child support from \nthe biological father. Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor since January \n2020. (Tr. 17-20; GE 1) \nWhen Applicant married in 2014, he had a solid financial track record. He was \nworking in academia, and his wife had been with the same employer for more than 10 \nyears. Applicant paid his bills on time, including his student loans, and lived within his \nmeans. In 2014, Applicant was offered an academia job in a different state, and they \nmoved. In August 2014, they obtained a mortgage and were able to purchase a house \ntogether. Applicant\u2019s wife was pregnant when they moved. They decided that she would \nnot look for a job in their new location until after the baby was born. They had their first \nchild in December 2014. (Tr. 20-26; GE 1) \nDuring and after the pregnancy, Applicant\u2019s wife began to experience persistent \nand severe health problems. She was diagnosed with the following issues: fibromyalgia; \nbipolar disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; an anxiety disorder, arising from events \nfrom her past and an abusive first marriage; and a chronic heart condition, which was \nexacerbated by her pregnancy. These health conditions made her ability to function \noutside the home difficult. When Applicant and his wife moved, they had every intention \nof maintaining a two-income household. They kept hoping that his wife\u2019s condition would \nimprove and would not keep her out of work long term. Applicant testified that their second \nchild was born in September 2016 and that this pregnancy was unplanned. They used \ntheir savings, loans, and credit cards to supplement the loss of her income, believing that \nthey would pay the credit cards, loans, and replenish their savings when his wife returned \nto work. Under doctor\u2019s orders she was prohibited from returning to work after a normal \nperiod of maternity leave. As a result, their household income was severely reduced.

His wife applied for Social Security disability \nin 2015. She was initially denied. She appealed, and the investigative process, interviews, \nand hearings took several years. Her claim was finally adjudicated in the fall of 2019, and \nshe was approved for social security disability payments, which began in December 2019. \nThe resolution of her claim came too late to help their financial problems. (Answer to \nSOR; AE B, J) \nThe reduction in Applicant\u2019s household income put a strain on their finances. His \nwife remained ill and required frequent and more complex treatments. Their medical bills \nincreased in both number and amounts. Paying those bills on one income meant others \ndid not get paid. Applicant\u2019s medical insurance was provided through the state where he \nworked, but was inadequate. Most of his wife\u2019s medical bills were only partially covered \nby insurance. In addition, some of his stepson\u2019s medical and special education expenses \nwere not covered. He estimated in 2016 and 2017, his out-of-pocket expenses totaled \nbetween $10,000 and $15,000. Applicant described this as an inescapable cycle, where \nhis wife could not get well without the medical treatments, but they would not be able to \nafford the treatments without more income. Their savings were depleted and their credit \nwas exhausted as their debts grew. (Tr. 60-61; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant got a new job with the federal government in June 2016. His salary \nincreased by approximately 20%. Despite this increase it was not enough to meet daily \nliving expenses and pay down his debts. The amount he spent on gas increased because \nhis new job required him to drive 216 miles each day. He fell behind in his mortgage and \ncar payments. In 2017, both his vehicles were repossessed. Applicant\u2019s wife attempted \nto return to work in mid-2018. Due to her medical conditions, she missed multiple days of \nwork per week. She was forced to leave her job in September 2018. While she worked \nthey were able to catch up on some of their bills, but after she left her job, they were again \nin a dire financial crisis. (Tr. 24-29, 61-62; Answer to SOR) \nOn December 21, 2018, Applicant\u2019s employer notified him they were terminating \nhis program and position, and his last official day would be January 5, 2019. Applicant \nsaid the termination was abrupt and unexpected. Applicant believed he was wrongfully \nterminated. He applied for unemployment insurance, and it was initially denied because \nhis supervisor claimed his termination was due to poor performance. He and his \nsupervisor had clashed in the past over how to run the research program. Despite the \nsuccess of the program, Applicant believed his supervisor was attempting to get rid of \nhim. His supervisor failed to follow procedural requirements for terminating Applicant. He \nappealed the decision and requested a hearing. Six months later in June 2019, the \npresiding administrative judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor. While employed, Applicant \nreceived two commendations and awards for his performance and service. During the six \nmonths that he waited for his hearing, Applicant had no income. He then received \nunemployment insurance payments for 12 weeks. He requested distribution of his \nretirement contributions from his federal government pension, but because he was \nemployed less than three years, he only received his contributions and not what normally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwould be matched by the employer.

He sought a loan \nmodification and a loan deferment which were denied. He sought help through the state\u2019s \nforeclosure prevention fund. His application was denied. He attempted to sell the house, \nbut the buyer wanted $13,000 of repairs to be made first, which he could not afford. He \nattempted to get the mortgage company to approve a short sale, but it was unwilling. (Tr. \n30-34; Answer to SOR; AE G) \nIn August 2019, Applicant and his family vacated their home and moved back to \ntheir home state and in with his wife\u2019s parents. He had no income and no means of \npurchasing necessities, such as food, for his family. Applicant found a part-time adjunct \nteaching position while he looked for permanent employment. He tried one more time to \nget a loan modification for the mortgage or a short sale approval from the mortgage \ncompany, which was again denied. The home was foreclosed in November 2019. (Tr. 33-\n34, 52; Answer to SOR; AE G) \n \nApplicant interviewed for several jobs throughout the summer and fall of 2019 and \nwas hired by his current employer in January 2020. He stated that he was adamant about \ntrying to settle his debts, regardless of how long it took. However, with the foreclosure of \nhis home and two vehicle repossessions, along with other debts he incurred to meet basic \nnecessities for his family of six, it was not feasible for him to pay his delinquent debts in \na reasonable timeframe. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s new job pays wells, but it is offset by the high cost of living in the area. \nHe explained that his wife\u2019s social security disability benefit is helpful, but it is a small \namount. His monthly medical bills for his wife and four children are significant. He noted \nthat his stepson with special needs has celiac disease and requires a special diet that is \nmore expensive. He also requires regular therapy and counseling, as part of his special \neducation plan. Many of his stepson\u2019s education and medical needs are not covered by \ninsurance. (Tr. 35-40; Answer to SOR; AE L, M) \nApplicant has calculated that after paying for his family\u2019s necessities, including \npayments on his student loans, the small amount he could put towards a monthly payment \nschedule for his delinquent debts would mean a payoff period of 50 years. Based on his \nfinances and advice from his attorneys, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, instead of Chapter \n13. He has participated in financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy. He maintains a \ndetailed budget. (Tr. 40-45; Answer to SOR; AE L, M) \nUntil Applicant started his job, they were only receiving his wife\u2019s Social Security \ndisability benefits while he was unemployed. Hence, they did not have the retainer fee to \nfile bankruptcy. He was advised by the attorneys to not pay his delinquent debts in \nanticipation of filing bankruptcy. Applicant was able to retain the services of a law firm \nthat pairs people with financial difficulties with local bankruptcy attorneys where a \nreasonable payment plan for their retainer is worked out.

He expects his debts to be discharged by the end of the year. (Tr. 4\n 0-45, 48-\n52, 64-65; Answer to SOR; AE H, N) \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. With his wife\u2019s Social Security \ndisability benefits and his salary-, they are able to meet their obligations. He has started a \nsavings account for unexpected expenses and has approximately $1,000 in it. He is \nparticipating in his employer\u2019s pension plan, making regular contributions that are \nmatched. They rent their home.

He did it a few times over \napproximately three months. Each time, he paid the credit card bill when it was due. He \nwas aware he was not authorized to use the card for his personal benefit. He \nacknowledged that what he did was wrong. He testified he does not have a defense for \nhis actions, other than he was feeding his family. His command confronted him with his \nactions and he readily admitted his wrongdoing. He was required to complete a \ngovernment credit card counseling program, which he did. His credit card was \ndeactivated. No further action was taken. This was his only instance of misuse. (Tr. 45-\n48, 63-64; GE 4) \nApplicant stated that his financial problems were caused by circumstances that \nwere out of his control and he took reasonable action to try to resolve them. He and his \nfamily live within their means. He provided numerous letters from colleagues and family \nattesting to his outstanding character, integrity, and loyalty. He is described as \ntrustworthy, honest, intelligent, hardworking, responsible, ethical, dedicated, and a \nperson who exercises sound judgment. They further attest to how he handled his financial \nstruggles and note that they were brought on by circumstances beyond his control. (Tr. \n76-77; Answer to SOR; AE I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that have been delinquent for several \nyears. He misused his government credit card several times. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2015 and can best be described as a \n\u201cperfect storm.\u201d He moved his family to a new state for a new job. His wife was pregnant \nand they planned for her to return to work after she had the baby. They purchased a \nhouse. When his wife had serious medical issues during and after her pregnancy and \nwas unable to work, their finances began to deteriorate. She applied for Social Security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbenefits in 2015 and was denied. Her appeal took several years and by the time she was \ngranted benefits it was too late to ameliorate their financial delinquencies. Applicant lost \nhis job and was wrongfully denied unemployment benefits for six months. Again, when \nhe finally received them it was too late to help. He withdrew his pension contributions to \nhelp his finances. He used savings, credit cards and loans to pay for necessities believing \nhis wife would resume work. He attempted to prevent his house from foreclosure, seeking \nloan modifications, a deferment, and eventually attempted to sell the home. The offer to \npurchase the house came with a condition for making repairs, which Applicant could not \nafford. He attempted to do a short sale and was denied by the mortgage company. \nApplicant moved his family and lived with his in-laws. He worked as an adjunct professor \nuntil he found permanent employment. \nApplicant eventually found a good job and moved his family again. He has been \nslowly recovering from financial distress. After reviewing all of his finances and indicating \nhis willingness to repay his past debts, his calculations show that it would take 50 years \nfor him to resolve them through a payment plan. He consulted with attorneys about filing \nbankruptcy. He hired an attorney who permitted him to pay his retainer fee through a \npayment plan. He recently completed the plan and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by conditions beyond his control as \nnoted above. He lost his job; his wife had medical problems and was unable to work; \nthere was a lengthy delay in receiving unemployment benefits and Social Security \ndisability benefits; and his stepson has special expenses that are not covered by \ninsurance. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, attempting to pay his \nbills from his savings and pension contributions. He also used credit cards and loans that \nhe intended pay, but when his wife could not resume work, he was unable. Applicant \nrecently filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in accordance with his lawyer\u2019s advice. I believe under \nthese circumstances filing bankruptcy is prudent. I have considered all of the evidence \nand do not believe Applicant was living beyond his means or acting irresponsibly. Life \nevents seriously impacted his finances and he struggled to provide for his family. I \nconsidered his misuse of a government credit card to be an aberration in his behavior. \nHe has a budget and participated in financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems occurred under unique circumstances and are unlikely to \nrecur. I find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.w: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He also claimed that he has no intention to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future for reasons to be explained at hearing. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old carpenter for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant \nand material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never married or entered into a legally recognized domestic \npartnership and has no children. (GE 1) He is currently engaged to a woman who has \nan adolescent son who has grown close to Applicant, but currently he has no wedding \ndate planned. (Tr. 21, 66-70) Applicant earned a high school diploma in June 1993 and \nattended three semesters of community college without earning a diploma. (GE 1 and \nAEs A-B; Tr. 18) He reported no military service. (GE 1) \nSince January 2000, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor as a carpenter, who has sponsored him for a security clearance.

He \nhas held a security clearance since July 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 20) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nBetween June 1994 and April 2019, Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency, mostly in social situations. (GEs1-2 and AE B; Tr. 23-24) Between July 2015 \nand April 2019, he used marijuana while holding a security clearance. From 2015 to \nApril 2019, he purchased marijuana from friends for his personal use. (GE 1-2 and AE \nA; Tr. 27-28) Applicant explained that he used marijuana mainly to relax and sleep at \nnight. (Tr. 26-27) He estimated to have used marijuana roughly twice a week and more \non weekends between 2004 and 2011, and less between 2011 and April 2019. \nMotivated by a desire to be a better role model for his girlfriend and her young \nson (11 years of age at the time), he made a personal decision in April 2019 to \ndiscontinue all marijuana activity (both use and purchases) that remained illegal in his \nstate of residence despite its decriminalization. (Tr. 25-27, 30, 39) For the years he \nused marijuana, he never felt any dependent need for the drug. (Tr. 26) \nIn his June 2015 personal subject interview (PSI with an investigator from the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant admitted to using marijuana in \nvarying frequencies (mostly with friends in social situations) between June 1994 and \nJune 2015. (AE B; Tr. 27) In this same interview, he admitted to purchasing marijuana \nfrom different friends throughout this period. When asked by the OPM investigator about \nhis motivations for using marijuana, he replied that he used marijuana to help him relax \nand \u201cjust have fun.\u201d (AE B) \nIn his PSI, Applicant informed the OPM investigator of a drug-related arrest he \nincurred in November 1997 (at the age of 20) while driving home with a friend. (AE B; \nTr. 38) After spending a night in custody, Applicant appeared in court the following day \nand was court-ordered to seek counseling and pay a fine. Applicant is credited with \nenrolling in an outpatient substance abuse counseling and completing the bi-weekly \ncounseling prior to his court appearance. (Tr. 38-39) Appearing in court, Applicant was \nordered to enroll in drug counseling and fined. Both imposed conditions were satisfied \nby Applicant. (AE B; Tr. 38-39) \nThis 1997 drug-related incident was the only time that Applicant was ever \nstopped, arrested, and charged by police for marijuana possession. When asked by the \ninterviewing OPM investigator about his intentions to continue using marijuana, \nApplicant replied (according to the summary of his PSI) that \u201cthe chances of recurrence \nare very little.\u201d (AE B; Tr. 32-33, 37-38) Based in part on Applicant\u2019s implicit assurances \nof future abstinence, he was granted a security clearance in July 2015 without any \napparent imposed conditions. (GE 1; Tr. 37) \nApplicant currently disputes his telling the OPM investigator in his 2015 PSI of his \nlikely avoidance of marijuana in the future (Tr. 33). In his hearing testimony, he claims \nhe told the agent of his intentions to continue using marijuana in the future. (Tr. 33) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s PSI summary of interview contains no references to any place in the \nsummary where Applicant claimed his intentions to continue using marijuana. (Tr. 33-\n34) Without more evidence of Applicant\u2019s revised account of his PSI statements to the \nOPM investigator, his revised account of what he claims he told the investigator cannot \nbe accepted based on his verbal claims alone. \nClaiming that he believed his being honest and forthright about his future \nintentions to continue using marijuana was enough, he continued his use of marijuana \nunder a claimed implicit understanding that he could do so despite his awareness of \nstate and federal bans on marijuana use and possession. (Tr. 36-37, 41-42) \n \nIn May 2021, prior to his scheduled hearing, Applicant completed a statement of \nintent never to use \u201cany illegal drugs in the future\u201d (AE C) He agreed to an automatic \nrevocation of any suitability determination, fitness determination, or security clearance \nhe may hold should he violate his promise never to use illegal drugs. (AE C) However, \nhe qualified his intention to abstain from marijuana activity, by limiting his intention to \nabstain for only so long as federal rules and regulations governing sensitive positions \nproscribed his use of the substance. (AE C) In his hearing testimony, he affirmed his \nnarrowed understanding of what laws and regulations he would abide by while holding a \nsecurity clearance and did not rule out his resumption of marijuana use were the \nGovernment to lift its federal ban without regard to the legal status of marijuana use and \npossession in his state of residence. (AE C; Tr. 32-33 and 43-44)  \nIn 2016, the legislature of Applicant\u2019s state of residence decriminalized \npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia and substituted civil fines for criminal \npenalties without fully legalizing marijuana use and possession. (Tr. 34-35) Legislative \nstudies are continuing in Applicant\u2019s state on the subject of legalization of marijuana, \nand some legislative movement is expected in 2022. But for now, marijuana use and \npossession remains illegal in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. \nWith this legislative background, Applicant\u2019s claimed implicit understanding that \nhis continued use of marijuana following his receipt of a clearance was permissible must \nbe weighed against the backdrop of his admitted awareness of state and federal bans \non marijuana use and possession. (Tr. 33-35) While Applicant was not aware of any \nspecific anti-drug policies maintained by his employer, he fully acknowledged his \nawareness, at all relevant times, of the DoD\u2019s ban on all illegal drugs (marijuana \nincluded) in his PSI interview in 2015, and reaffirmed his same understanding of both \nthe federal ban on marijuana possession and his state\u2019s decriminalization of marijuana \npossession in his hearing testimony. (Tr. 29-30, 49-41) \nApparently because he was honest about his marijuana use throughout the \ninvestigation process about his marijuana use and likely discontinuance of future use,  \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in July 2015 with no apparent restrictions on \nfuture marijuana activity communicated to Applicant. With no reported input from his \nfacility security officer (FSO) on his continued marijuana use, he continued to believe \n(his account) that he had implicit permission to continue using the substance.

True, he has been generally upfront about his past marijuana use whenever \nhe was called upon to account and has disassociated from many of his old friends and \nacquaintances who used marijuana, although not all. (Tr. 33) Under these special \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s claimed understanding of his implicit permission to continue \nusing marijuana after being granted a security clearance cannot be accepted at face \nvalue without more corroborative evidence. \nWith the support of his fianc\u00e9 and her son, Applicant has matured considerably \nand has moved away from marijuana and most of his past friends and acquaintances \nwho used marijuana. (Tr. 66-68) Since his last use of marijuana in April 2019, Applicant \nhas maintained his abstinence from all illegal drugs, inclusive of marijuana. (Tr. 36-37) \nTo corroborate and reinforce his abstinence assurances, he enrolled in a 16-hour \nmarijuana education program and documented his successful completion of the \nprogram. (AE D) All of his efforts are encouraging. \nHowever, Applicant brings to these proceedings a lengthy history of marijuana \nusage and purchases to meet his personal needs and has furnished a qualified \ncommitment to abstinence in his state of intent and hearing testimony. Acknowledging \nthe continued federal and state bans on marijuana use and possession (save for the \nsubstitution of civil for criminal penalties in his state\u2019s legal ban), he could not rule out a \nreturn to marijuana use should one of two events occur: his retirement or the repeal of \nthe federal ban. He offered nothing about his recurrence intentions should his state\u2019s \nban remain in place.  \nEndorsements \nApplicant is well-regarded by his supervisors, coworkers, and friends who have \nknown and worked with him. (AEs E and G) They credit him with being a great worker \nand leader, trustworthy, and a carpenter who is admired by all who have worked with \nhim. (AE E) His fianc\u00e9 acknowledged her awareness of his marijuana use when they first \nmet in 2016, but credited him with giving up marijuana altogether after they bought a \nhouse together in March 2019. (AE E; Tr. 68) She described Applicant with being a good \nrole model for her teenage son, who treats him as his father, and she expressed \ncomplete confidence in Applicant\u2019s maintaining his abstinence from marijuana and illegal \ndrugs in general in the foreseeable future. (AE E; Tr. 68-70) \nOver the course of the past two years, Applicant has successfully completed \nnumerous training and awareness courses (11 in all) sponsored by his employer. (AE F) \nHis completed courses covered asbestos operations (January 2020), OSHA/USACE \nannual awareness (February 2020), USACE and OSHA protection (February 2021), \ninsider threats (February 2020), lift truck operation (March 2020), and scaffolding safety \npractices.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for\n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Drug Involvement \n \n           The Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because  such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Considered together, \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana raises security concerns over whether \nApplicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern misbehavior incompatible with the judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified information. \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the \nAGs for drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a),\u201dany substance \nmisuse,\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of Illegal drugs \nor drug paraphernalia,\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to sustained abstinence from all \ninvolvement with marijuana (albeit with a commitment that is limited in scope) and with \nthe support of his fianc\u00e9 and her adolescent son, he has maintained his abstinence from \nmarijuana and all illegal drugs for over two years. With the aid of drug education, he \nexhibited no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or pressures he \nmight encounter to return to marijuana use. He fully understands that marijuana and \nother controlled drugs remain illegal under federal law and the DoD\u2019s anti-drug policy; \neven though marijuana has since been decriminalized under his state\u2019s law. \nTo be sure, Applicant has exhibited candor about his past involvement with \nmarijuana \nthroughout \nthe \ninvestigation \nprocess, \nhas \ndiscontinued \nhis \npast \nacquaintances with friends and contacts known to have been involved in marijuana \nactivities, and has shown marked improvement in his judgment and maturity level in the \ntwo years he has moved away from his marijuana involvement. Still, his commitment to \nfuture abstinence from marijuana is limited by the duration of the federal ban and his \nown need for a security clearance. As framed, his commitment to abstinence must be \ntreated as a qualified one, \nApplicant\u2019s assurances of sustained abstinence from marijuana are encouraging. \nAnd, his efforts warrant partial application of two mitigating conditions (MCs) of the drug \ninvolvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d and 26(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to, (1) disassociation \nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment \nwhere drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n     \n \n \n \n   \n                               \n \n \n \n \n        \n \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement \nor misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d \nApplicant is entitled to credit with being honest to both the Government and his \nfianc\u00e9 about his past marijuana use. With over two years of demonstrated abstinence \nfrom marijuana and increased understanding of the importance of giving up marijuana \nto facilitate his being a better role model to his fiance and her adolescent son, \nApplicant\u2019s progress in abandoning marijuana after so many years of sustained use is \nencouraging. His efforts to date, however, still remain a work in progress that require \nmore time in sustained abstinence to facilitate safe predictions that he is no longer a \nrecurrence risk. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has established independent \nprobative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, maturity and good judgment \nrequired of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or sensitive position. \nHis efforts to date still fall short of the evidentiary requirements for mitigating security \nrisks associated with his long history of marijuana activity and still a relatively brief \nperiod of sustained abstinence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, there is insufficient positive \nevidence of sustainable mitigation in the record to make safe predictable judgments \nabout his ability to avoid marijuana and other illegal drugs in the foreseeable future. \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s past \nmarijuana use, his strong endorsements and contributions to the defense industry, and \nrelatively brief period of sustained abstinence (just over two years), he does not mitigate \nsecurity concerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.e. Offering a \nconditional abstinence commitment in these circumstances is not enough to absolve \nhim of recurrence risks in light of his many years of using and purchasing marijuana, \nincluding over four years of continued use after he received a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude drug involvement security\nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n                                                             Conclusion  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
