Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 3, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On November 2, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn November 20, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) Because of health \nconcerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic protocols, no further \nactions were taken regarding the case until the following year. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 30, 2021, and she was afforded \nan opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 4, 2022. Her response was due on February 3, \n2022. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of February 24, 2022, no \nresponse had been received. The case was assigned to me on March 17, 2022. The \nrecord closed on February 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all of \nthe SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h., and \n1.j. through 1.m.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas an administrative specialist with her current employer since January 2009. She \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree in 1985. She has never served with the U.S. military. She \nwas granted a secret clearance in 2011. She was married in 1990 and widowed in 2007. \nShe remarried in 2014. She has two children, born in 1992 and 1996, and one stepchild, \nborn in 2004. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated November 20, \n2020); Item 3 (SF 86, dated July 3, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview (ESI), \ndated September 17, 2019); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March 2, 2020); and \nItem 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated July 17, \n2019). \nIn her SF 86, with one exception pertaining to a credit card that was charged off in \n2018, Applicant denied having any financial issues involving delinquent accounts that \nhad, in the past seven years, been turned over to a collection agency; had any account \nor credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; or been \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \nover 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously reported. She also denied being \ncurrently (as of July 3, 2019) over 120 days delinquent on any debt. (Item 3 at 35-36) \nOn September 17, 2019, she was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, she acknowledged the \none delinquent account that she has reported in her SF 86. When questioned by the \ninvestigator regarding other delinquent accounts, she denied ever neglecting her financial \nresponsibilities, claiming that she lives within her means, and again denied any additional \nfinancial delinquencies. She stated that she had never been 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt and had never had any credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed. She denied ever having had any bills of debts turned over to a \ncollections agency (Item 4, 3-4) She lied to the investigator. \nApplicant was confronted with a myriad of collection accounts, many of which were \ncharged-off accounts or over 120 days past due. The confrontation was successful, for \nshe admitted that she was trying to conceal the accounts from the investigation. She did \nnot think the finances were anybody\u2019s business, to include the government. She did not \nthink the accounts were going to be discovered. She claimed she was scared to admit \nthe accounts were delinquent because she did not want to lose her security clearance. \nShe also acknowledged that she had had bad spending habits in the past and was very \nfinancially irresponsible. She also claimed that three back surgeries in 2016, 2017, and \n2018 kept her out of work for two months after each surgery, and therefor was unable to \npay anything other than her medical bills. After discussing her delinquent accounts, \nApplicant stated an intention to focus on settling or otherwise resolving them. (Item 4 at \n6-7) She did not furnish any documents to verify that she had undergone such surgeries. \nThe SOR alleged 13 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $27,338, as \nset forth below, divided into four separate categories: \nAmong the accounts that were charged off, and for which Applicant made no \nclaims that she had made any efforts to resolve, there are: SOR \u00b6 1.a., a credit-card \naccount with an unpaid balance of $872; SOR \u00b6 1.b., a charge account with an unpaid \nbalance of $829; SOR \u00b6 1.c., a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $787; SOR \n\u00b6 1.e., a credit-card account \u2013 the one identified in the SF 86 and during the OPM \ninterview \u2013 with an unpaid balance of $593; SOR \u00b6 1.f., an unspecified type of account \nwith an unpaid balance of $454; and SOR \u00b6 1.g., a credit-card account with an unpaid \nbalance of $451. (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 11-12) None of the accounts have been resolved. \nAmong the accounts that are merely delinquent, and for which Applicant made no \nclaims that she had made any efforts to resolve, there are: SOR \u00b6 1.h., an unspecified \ntype of account with an unpaid balance of $425; SOR \u00b6 1.k., an unspecified type of \naccount with an unpaid balance of $3,009; and SOR \u00b6 1.l., an unspecified type of account \nwith an unpaid balance of $572. (Item 6 at 10, 12) None of the accounts have been \nresolved. \nAmong the accounts that were delinquent, and for which Applicant contended that \nshe had either paid off or was currently on a payment plan: SOR \u00b6 1.d., a credit-card \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccount with an unpaid balance of $686 (purportedly paid off); SOR \u00b6 1.j., an unspecified \ntype of account with an unpaid balance of $613 (purportedly paid off); and SOR \u00b6 1.m., \nan unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $915 (purportedly on a payment \nplan). (Item 6 at 10-13; Item 5 at 2) Applicant failed to furnish any documentary evidence, \nsuch as statements or receipts from the creditors, cancelled checks, check registers, or \npayment plans, to support her contentions that payments had been made towards any of \nthe three accounts in this particular category or that a payment plan was actually accepted \nby a creditor. The accounts have not been resolved. \nThe fourth category refers to an account that Applicant not only claimed was not \nher account, but also stated that she had disputed in August 2019 and several times \nthereafter, but never received a response: SOR \u00b6 1.i., a credit-card account with an \nunpaid balance of $17,583. (Item 6 at 5, 9; Item 4 at 6; and Item 2 at 4) Applicant failed \nto furnish any documentary evidence, such as written disputes identifying the addressed \nrecipients of the disputes. The account has not been resolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. She did not report her net monthly \nincome, her monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In the absence \nof such information, I am unable to determine if she has any monthly remainder available \nfor savings or spending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that her financial \nproblems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than she had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 13 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $27,338. \nApplicant attributed her inability to maintain those accounts in a current status, in part to \nthree back surgeries in 2016, 2017, and 2018 that purportedly kept her out of work for \ntwo months after each surgery; her inability to pay anything other than her medical bills \nafter her surgeries; and her acknowledgement that she had had bad spending habits in \nthe past and was very financially irresponsible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy her debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nIn the absence of documentary or otherwise evidence to verify that Applicant took \nany positive action to resolve her delinquent accounts or that she underwent back \nsurgeries, none of the conditions apply. As noted above, Applicant identified several \nfactors for the reasons she was not proactive or successful in addressing her accounts: \n(1) her three back surgeries that kept her out of work for two months after each surgery; \n(2) her inability to pay anything other than her medical bills after her surgeries; and (3) \nshe had had bad spending habits in the past and was very financially irresponsible. \nAlthough she was employed without interruption since January 2009, she has made only \nthree unverified claims of positive resolution action, but she failed to furnish the \ndocumentation to support her claims. Moreover, she failed to offer a reasonable basis for \nher claimed dispute regarding one particular delinquent account. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Although Applicant claimed that she had been making \nsome payments to two of her creditors and paid them off, and she had a payment plan \nwith another creditor, she offered no verifiable evidence of a good-faith effort to support \nany of those claims. Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in September \n2019, but between that interview and the date her response to the FORM was expected \nin February 3, 2022, she made no verifiable efforts to address any of her delinquent debts. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored her delinquent accounts \nfor a substantial multi-year period. Because of her failure to furnish documentation \nregarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that \nher financial problems are not under control. She has not acted responsibly by failing to \naddress her delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make limited, if any, \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nverifiable efforts of working with her creditors. The Appeal Board has previously \ncommented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any documentary evidence that she has even \nbegun making such efforts even after the SOR was issued in November 2020 \u2013 nearly \none year and one-half ago. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered no specifics \nregarding any repayment efforts; submitted no documentary evidence to reflect any \npayments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one delinquent debt \nhas been resolved since the SOR was issued. \nThe SOR did not allege that Applicant had intentionally falsified her response to \nthe financial section of the SF 86 in July 2019, or intentionally initially lied to the OPM \ninvestigator regarding her financial history in September 2019 \u2013 both actions considered \nto be unacceptable personal conduct. Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain \npurposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR \nmay be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether \nan applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-\nperson analysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged personal \nconduct actions will be considered only for the five purposes listed above. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as an \nadministrative specialist with her current employer since January 2009. She received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 1985. She was granted a secret clearance in 2011. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has 13 still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $27,338. She attributed her inability to maintain those accounts in a current \nstatus, in part to three back surgeries in 2016, 2017, and 2018 that purportedly kept her \nout of work for two months after each surgery; her inability to pay anything other than her \nmedical bills after her surgeries; and her acknowledgement that she had had bad \nspending habits in the past and was very financially irresponsible. Despite being \nemployed since January 2009, between her OPM investigator in September 2019 and \nthe date her response to the FORM was expected in February 3, 2022, she made no \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nverifiable efforts to address any of her delinquent debts. Applicant deliberately omitted \nand concealed negative financial information in her SF 86 and subsequently deliberately \nfalsified her responses and tried to conceal her true financial history during questioning \nby an OPM investigator. She finally admitted that she was trying to conceal the accounts \nfrom the investigation because she did not think her finances were anybody\u2019s business, \nto include the government. She did not think the accounts were going to be discovered. \nShe claimed she was scared to admit the accounts were delinquent because she did not \nwant to lose her security clearance. Her lack of candor is disturbing. There are lingering \nquestions if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Item 2) \nOn December 21, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. \n(Gov 1) A subsequent security clearance background investigation revealed Applicant \nhad the following financial issues: a $5,737 account owed to a jewelry store that was \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 2 at 40; Item 3 at 5; Item 4 at 1, 2); Applicant \nowes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $13,230 for delinquent income \ntaxes from tax years 2014, 2017, and 2018; (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 2 at 38-39; Item 3 at 10-\n11, 17); and Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nand 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 3 at 5, 20)  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied owing the delinquent jewelry store \naccount. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He indicated the account was paid off on January 1, 2022. He did \nnot provide documentary proof that the debt was paid off in full. He denies that he has \nnot filed his federal income taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He claims \nthe tax returns were filed in January 2022. Applicant did not provide documentary proof \nthat his federal income tax returns were filed. Applicant admits that he still owes the \ndebt for delinquent federal income taxes. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant states that he owed the \nIRS a lot more. He has made payments towards his delinquent federal income tax debts \nwith varying consistency between December 2015 to September 2019. (Item 3 at 17-18) \nHowever, Applicant did not provide documents indicating the current balance and status \nof his federal tax debt. \nApplicant listed his federal tax debts and the delinquent jewelry store account on \nhis security clearance application. He encountered financial problems because of low \nperiods of employment in 2018 and his wife suffered from an illness. He had no health \ninsurance and used his money to pay his wife\u2019s medical debts. During this time, the \njewelry store account became delinquent. Applicant claims he has been making monthly \npayments towards this debt since obtaining full-time employment in October 2018. He \ndid not provide corroborating evidence such as receipts, or a payment history to verify \nhis payments toward this account, or proof of its resolution in January 2022. (Item 3 at \n5-6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems which are primarily delinquent \nfederal income taxes totaling approximately $13,230 for tax years 2014, 2017, and \n2018. He also owes approximately $5,737 for a delinquent jewelry store debt that was \nplaced for collection. Finally, he did not file his federal income tax returns for tax years \n2015 and 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, the emphasis of the DOHA Appeal \nBoard on security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. \n14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \n\u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action \nonly after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that \nApplicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of \nrules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); See also \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal \nGovernment for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other \nobligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control: \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nHis federal tax debt remains unresolved. Applicant provided no proof that he is making \nregular payments towards this debt. Although he claims to have filed his 2015 and 2016 \nfederal tax returns and resolved his delinquent jewelry store account, he did not provide \ndocumentary proof. For this reason, these issues remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely \naffected by his under-employment as well his wife\u2019s illness. However, he neglected his \nresponsibilities to insure that his federal income tax returns were filed and paid in a \ntimely manner. I cannot conclude that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nFor this reason, AG \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight. \nI cannot apply AG \u00b6 20(c) because Applicant did not present evidence that he \nattended financial counseling. His federal income tax issues and the jewelry store \naccount remain unresolved. I cannot conclude his financial situation is under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) partially applies pertaining to the federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b.  Applicant was making payments towards his federal tax debt related to his 2014 \ntaxes owed. However, it appears he stopped making steady payments towards the tax \ndebt. Applicant claims the jewelry store account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was paid in \nJanuary 2022. He did not provide documentation corroborating this assertion. Applicant \nappears to have good intentions, but he failed to provide sufficient information \ndocumenting his good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies in that Applicant was making payments on a payment \nplan with the IRS pertaining to his federal tax debt. However, he stopped making regular \nmonthly payments to the IRS. While Applicant states that federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016 were filed in January 2022, he provided no additional \ndocumentary proof that the tax returns were filed. Applicant\u2019s federal tax issues remain \nunresolved. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s employment \nhistory as a federal contractor since 2018. I considered that he provided full disclosure \nabout his financial situation and his tax debts on his security clearance application. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s household income was adversely affected by periods of under-\nemployment as well as his wife\u2019s illness. However, at the close of the record, his federal \ntax debts remain unresolved and there is no proof he filed the federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016. Security concerns under financial considerations are not \nmitigated.    \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I received the case \nassignment and file on December 2, 2021. \nOn March 4, 2022, after confirming that Applicant was still being sponsored for a \nsecurity clearance, I advised him that I was scheduling hearings via Microsoft Teams. On \nApril 4, 2022, I informed Applicant that I planned to schedule an online hearing in his case \nMay 10, 2022. Applicant confirmed receipt of the email and indicated that he had legal \nrepresentation. On April 6, 2022, counsel for Applicant entered an appearance. On April 8, \n2022, I scheduled a video teleconference hearing for May 10, 2022. On April 11, 2022, \nApplicant\u2019s attorneys requested a continuance to obtain relevant documentation, which I \ngranted without any objections from the Government. After some coordination with the \nparties, on July 11, 2022, I scheduled an in-person hearing for August 15, 2022. \nAt the hearing, convened as scheduled, five Government exhibits (GE 1-5) and 14 \nApplicant exhibits (AEs A-B and D-O) were admitted in evidence without any objections. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on August \n25, 2022. Counsel for Applicant was granted three weeks after the hearing to submit a tax \ntranscript to be marked and considered as AE C. \nOn August 29, 2022, counsel for Applicant requested an extension of the deadline \nfor post-hearing submissions. I extended the deadline to September 20, 2022, without any \nobjections from the Government. On August 31, 2022, AE C was submitted and accepted \ninto the record without objection. \nSummary of Pleadings \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of April 30, 2020, Applicant owed \n$1,285,782 on a federal tax lien entered in January 2020 for TYs 2017 and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a); $133,636 on a federal tax lien entered in March 2018 for TY 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and \n$57,152 on a federal tax lien entered in July 2007 for TY 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).

He \nstated that he has paid his tax debts for the tax years alleged and that the liens in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d should have been released as he paid his taxes for those tax years in a timely manner. \nHe denied any falsification of his SF 86 as there was no lien against him as of his personal \nsubject interview (PSI). He added that any audit, adjustment, or revision by tax authorities \nresults in a tax lien, no matter the fault or adjustment reason. He asserted that his tax \nsituations get resolved by him either receiving credit or him paying additional taxes. \n(Answer.) \nFindings of Fact \nIn setting forth my findings, some details, including specific amounts of income and \ntax liabilities, were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information is \navailable in the cited exhibits and transcript. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 61 years old. He has his bachelor\u2019s degree with a concentration in \nfinance and his master\u2019s degree in business administration. The degrees were earned in \nMay 1984 and May 2003, respectively. In October 2013, he began consulting for a \ncompany that has DOD contracts. At the time, the company had a sole owner who was \nseeking to retire. Applicant became a full-time employee of the company in February 2014, \nearning $220,000 a year. (Tr. 76-77.) In late November 2015, with a $21 million line of \ncredit, he became a one-fifth owner of the company, which is structured as an S \ncorporation for tax purposes. (Tr. 77.) He was the company\u2019s chief financial officer before \n2021 when he became its vice chairman and chief strategic officer. (GE 1; Tr. 26-31.) He is \nrequired to obtain a security clearance because of his position as a senior management \nofficial. (Tr. 30.) Pending a final adjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, the \ncompany\u2019s board of directors has temporarily excluded him from access to classified \ninformation. (AEs H-I.)  \nApplicant and his spouse have been married since September 1992. They have a \n25-year-old son and a 27-year-old daughter who live independently. Applicant and his \nspouse have owned their current residence since January 1996. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24.)

(GEs 4-\n5.) \nApplicant worked in the banking industry after college. He was laid off in 2000 from \nhis employment as chief operating officer for a bank. He lost his base salary of $140,000. \n(Tr. 80.) He was given severance, but not enough to cover his annual expenses, so he \nworked for another bank, earning $160,000 per year, until he was laid off in 2005, as the \nindustry underwent some consolidation and contraction. He then worked for an investment \ncompany at $150,000 per year (Tr. 80), knowing that his position was going to be \neliminated within two years, so in June 2006, he started his own consulting business. (GE \n1; Tr. 28-33.) Applicant did not have sufficient funds withheld or set aside for his taxes \nwhen he was self-employed as future work was not guaranteed. (Tr. 81-84.) \nThrough September 2013, Applicant was self-employed as a consultant performing \noperational and financial reviews and evaluating marketing programs and profitability for \nhis clients, which included a shipbuilding company; a toy train manufacturer; a software \nsales developer; a hardware company; and a sail maker. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) Applicant was, \nand continues to be, the sole income earner in his household. (Tr. 34.) He had a sizeable \nmortgage on his home as well as car loans, and found it challenging to \u201cmaintain a cost of \nliving that was acceptable.\u201d (Tr. 33-34.) His income fluctuated considerably over the years \n(Tr. 79) and was as low as $40,000 annually at one point. Applicant reduced expenses by \neating at home rather than at restaurants and taking vacations close to home. He worked \nwith his creditors to address his debts. Some debts were paid late. He regained financial \nstability about the time that he started his present employment. (Tr. 33-36.) \nApplicant and his spouse filed their joint income tax returns on time, but sometimes \nthey filed amended returns. He testified that it became difficult at times to estimate his tax \nliability. (Tr. 38.) There were times when he was self-employed when he sent in a payment \nwith their tax return but it was less than what he owed. (Tr. 44, 85.) He admits that he \n\u201cshould have been following [his] ups and downs in income.\u201d (Tr. 51.) However, for some \ntax years, he was billed late for taxes owed for a prior TY. (Tr. 86.) Tax underpayments by \nthem or tax adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and/or their state\u2019s \nDepartment of Revenue led to tax liens being placed against their property for unpaid taxes \nfor some tax years.

He responded negatively to all of the SF 86\u2019s financial record inquiries, \nincluding the following: \nIn the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or \nother taxes when required by law or ordinance? and \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had a lien placed against your \nproperty for failing to pay taxes or other debts. (Include financial obligations \nfor which you were the sole debtor, as well as those for which you were a \ncosigner or guarantor). (GE 1.) \nOn October 4, 2018, Applicant had a personal subject interview (PSI) with an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about \nthe SF 86 query concerning any liens in the last seven years, Applicant stated that he was \nnot certain how to answer the question.

(GE 2.) When asked on cross-examination why he did not fully disclose his tax \nproblems, he testified, in part: \nI explained to [the OPM investigator] I was going through a payment plan \nwith the IRS. She did not ask any details whatsoever. And I said I was on \ntarget \u2014 and was paying my taxes. . .  So it was noticed.

He denies ever receiving any notice of a tax lien having been filed. (Tr. 38-39, \n47.) The Government submitted notices of federal and state tax liens for the TYs alleged. \nThose notices were filed against Applicant and his spouse and properly recorded with the \nregistry of deeds in their county. (GE 3.) No evidence was presented showing that the lien \nnotices were mailed to Applicant. He knew he owed taxes and indicated that to his \nunderstanding, the IRS may choose or not to issue a lien for unpaid taxes. (Tr. 47-48.) He \nasserted in response to the SOR, \u201cIt is practice for any tax discrepancy that there be a lien \nplaced no matter if the issue is [the] taxpayer or Department of Revenue.\u201d (Answer.) \nRegarding adjustments to his federal and state tax liabilities, Applicant asserts that \nwhen he was notified of adjustments, he immediately communicated with the tax \nauthorities. He was assigned a representative and entered into payment plans to pay the \ntaxes. (Tr. 38-39, 48, 52.) He admitted that he paid some taxes late. (Tr. 47.) Applicant \nmaintains his own records of tax payments, which indicate that he paid the IRS \napproximately $3.4 million between October 18, 2016, and May 13, 2022, in addition to his \nstandard coupon payments based on his tax returns. (Tr. 92.) Applicant\u2019s payment records \nshow that, in 2016, he paid the IRS only $1,000 a week from October 18, 2016, through \nDecember 27, 2016, when his income exceeded $1 million that year. His weekly payment \nincreased over time (to $1,500 from mid-January 2017 to mid-February 2017; $1,900 from \nmid-February 2017 to mid-June 2017; $2,500 from mid-June 2017 to late December 2017; \n$4,000 throughout 2020; $5,000 from January 2021 to mid-April 2021; and $10,000 since \nthen).Included in the $3.4 million were the tax withholdings from his base salary (Tr. 109), \nwhich for recent years were as follows: $35,000 for TY 2017; $24,300 for TY 2018; \n$54,200 for TY 2019; $67,800 for TY 2020; and $65,400 for TY 2021 (AE L); and also \nsome quarterly lump-sum payments as large as $150,000 to $250,000 as determined by \nthe IRS. (Tr. 110-111.) Assuming he submitted sizeable estimated tax payments, the tax \nlien for 2017 and 2018 clearly shows that his estimated payments fell considerably short of \nwhat he and his spouse owed. Payment records from his bank show that just over $1.9 \nmillion was debited from his bank account between November 20, 2020, and May 6, 2022. \n(AE K.) Applicant estimated that, as of mid-August 2022, he has paid more than $3.7 \nmillion in taxes, including fees and penalties, with no effort on his part to reduce his tax \nburden. (Tr. 39.) As to why he did not indicate on his SF 86 that he had failed to pay some \ntaxes on time in the seven years preceding his November 2016 SF 86, Applicant reiterated \nthat he was unaware of the tax liens and that, while he was late in making certain \npayments to the IRS, he was making payments. (Tr. 68.) He testified that \u201canything that \n[he] had to pay that was late [he] never thought of that as being that negative.\u201d (Tr. 69.) He \nsubsequently explained, \nSo I filed my taxes, and I\u2019ve been paying the taxes. Did I pay it in full? No. I \ndidn\u2019t know the answer should have been, no. I didn\u2019t know I should have \nanswered, I have filed the taxes on time, but I owe the IRS some extra \nmoney. (Tr. 93.) \nHe testified that he read the SF 86 question about failing to pay any federal, state, or local \ntaxes in the last seven years as \u201cthat [he] failed and didn\u2019t pay any tax.\u201d (Tr. 94-95.) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2021, Applicant\u2019s company exceeded expectations and earned a profit of \napproximately $11 million.

He indicated that he not only has paid off the founder \nof the company but that he has obtained an additional $30 million in credit to pay off other \npartners. (Tr. 69-70.) \nApplicant is on a repayment plan with the IRS for TY 2020. (Tr. 40.) He reports that \nhe owed approximately $500,000 in 2016, which is down to \u201cslightly under\u201d $400,000, and \na little less than $1.3 million for 2020, which is down to about $800,000. (Tr. 52, 108.) He \nmakes weekly payments to the IRS (Tr. 52, 108) and controls the payments. In addition, he \nis required to make quarterly payments of $250,000. (Tr. 53.) \nApplicant\u2019s February 2020 credit report showed that, in August 2019, he obtained a \n$300,000 loan (balance $293,454) and a vehicle loan for $84,185 (balance $75,898). (GE \n5.) He testified that the $300,000 was a home-equity loan. (Tr. 103.) When asked why he \ntook on such a sizeable automobile loan when he had such a large federal income tax \ndelinquency, he testified that he thought he could afford the payments but turned the \nvehicle in to the dealer after only three months. The home-equity loan went to college \ntuition. (Tr. 104-105.) \nApplicant provided a current estimate of monthly expenses totaling $6,294, including \n$4,300 for his mortgage, but only $94 in electricity costs and $400 for gasoline. (AE O.) He \nconverted his heat system to natural gas, and recently upgraded his air conditioning units. \n(Tr. 37.) As of February 2020, the balance on their primary mortgage was $665,972 with \nscheduled repayment at $4,028 per month. (GE 5.) As of July 27, 2022, their mortgage \nbalance was $572,407. (AE E.) He testified that was paying $5,000 a month on his \nmortgage as of mid-August 2022. (Tr. 108.) Applicant has about $380,000 in combined \ninvestment and retirement assets. (Tr. 37.) \nApplicant has held several voluntary positions in the communities where he has \nlived over the years, including as a volunteer fireman, the founder of a street hockey \nleague, youth sports coach, treasurer of a local yacht club, and board member of his town\u2019s \nfinance committee. (Tr. 24-25.) \nCharacter References \nTwo long-time friends of Applicant attest to him being hardworking, honest, and \nreliable. They endorse Applicant for a security clearance as he is willing to follow rules and \ndedicated to maintaining confidentiality. (AE F.) Neither of the friends commented about \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues, so it is unclear whether they are aware of his substantial tax \nunderpayments that led to the issuance of both federal and state tax liens. \nA certified public accountant, who recently retired from being managing director of \nthe firm that provided audit and tax compliance services for Applicant\u2019s company, has \nprovided individual tax preparation services for Applicant since 2017.

(AE G.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant has a security significant history of tax underpayments of primarily federal \nbut also state income taxes over the past 20 years. The Government\u2019s evidence shows \nthat the IRS filed at least six different tax liens between July 2007 and January 2020 for \nunpaid tax liabilities totaling in excess of $1.6 million for TYs 2005 through 2008, 2011 and \n2012, and 2014 through 2018. Over $1.2 million was owed for TYs 2017 and 2018. The \nstate filed tax liens for approximately $8,700 in February 2008 for TY 2002 and for $15,700 \nin September 2011 for TYs 2006 through 2009. The only lien not released as of the April \n30, 2020 SOR was the $1,285,700 federal lien filed in January 2020 for TYs 2017 and \n2018. Even so, some of the liens were not resolved promptly. The $8,700 state tax lien for \nTY 2002 was resolved five years after the lien was filed. A $17,400 federal tax lien for TYs \n2006 and 2008, filed in December 2009, was not satisfied until May 2018. A $40,700 \nfederal lien filed in July 2010 for TY 2007 was not resolved until March 2018. Guideline F \nsecurity concerns are established when an individual does not comply with his or her tax \npayment obligations.

One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, given Applicant\u2019s persistent underpayment of \nhis federal income taxes by the tax deadlines. There is no evidence of any state tax \nunderpayments since TY 2009. However, he owed the IRS about $1,285,700 for tax years \n2017 and 2018 as of January 2020. He testified that he was assessed almost $1.3 million \nin additional federal income tax liabilities for tax years 2016 and 2020 that he is currently \nrepaying under a payment plan. While Applicant attributes the problem to a difficulty in \naccounting for the taxes owed on S corporation distributions, evidence of reform is lacking \nwith respect to a change in his handling of his tax matters to ensure that he pays most of \nhis taxes due when his future tax returns are filed. The concern in this regard is amplified, \ngiven his education in business management and finances. \nThe inconsistency in Applicant\u2019s income when he was self-employed from June \n2006 until January 2014 is a factor to consider in mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), but it does \nnot apply to his ongoing tax-payment issues since TY 2014. He was paid an annual salary \nof $200,000 when he became a full-time employee in January 2014. The evidence shows \nthat he had little more than $20,700 in federal income taxes withheld from wage earnings \nof approximately $233,000 in 2016. Due to significant pass-through income in 2016, his tax \nliability for 2016, based on his return, was about $466,400.

Based on his own \ncalculations, when considering his S corporation income, he had a federal tax liability of \napproximately $893,300. Even accounting for estimated tax payments, the discrepancies \nbetween what he paid to the IRS and what he owed when his tax returns were filed suggest \nthat he gave priority to maintaining \u201can acceptable lifestyle\u201d over a good-faith effort to \naddress his tax issues. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not satisfied by waiting for IRS assessments of \nsignificant tax underpayments. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(g) are established in that Applicant has made payments \nthat have fully resolved the tax liabilities alleged in the SOR. Yet, in another aspect, his \nhandling of his tax matters continues to raise concerns as to whether he can be counted on \nto give priority to paying his taxes over his personal interests. The Appeal Board has \nreaffirmed that the timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in \napplying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). It took Applicant almost \nsix years to pay off his $8,700 state tax debt from 2007 and eight years to satisfy his \n$17,400 in federal taxes owed for TYs 2006 and 2008. While lack of income could explain \nthe delay in addressing his state taxes for TY 2002, as those taxes were resolved in \nFebruary 2013, when he was still self-employed, Applicant has not provided reasonable \njustification for failing to satisfy his federal tax debt for TYs 2006 and 2008 sooner. The \n$17,400 lien for those past-due taxes was not released until May 30, 2018, despite \nadjusted gross income of some $1.4 million in TY 2016 and about $711,000 in TY 2017. \nHis $40,700 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2007, assessed in June 2010, was not fully \nresolved until March 2018, well after he applied for security clearance eligibility. \nA federal tax lien is the government\u2019s legal claim against property when an individual \ndoes not pay a tax debt. The lien protects the government\u2019s interest in all of an individual\u2019s \nproperty, including real estate, personal property, and financial assets. A federal tax lien is \nissued after the IRS assesses tax liability, sends a Notice and Demand (i.e. bill) for \npayment and the individual neglects or refuses to pay in full the debt in time. See \nwww.irs.gov. Applicant may not have known about the liens, but he received notices from \nthe IRS notifying him of his tax liability and the deadline for payment. The issuance of the \ntax liens indicates that Applicant did not pay the taxes owed within the time set by the IRS. \nLate payments triggered by demands for payment do not reflect the good-faith required for \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant\u2019s own payment records show that, in 2016, he paid \nthe IRS only $1,000 a week from October 18, 2016, through December 27, 2016, when his \nincome exceeded $1 million that year. His weekly payment increased over time (to $1,500 \nfrom mid-January 2017 to mid-February 2017; $1,900 from mid-February 2017 to mid-June \n2017; $2,500 from mid-June 2017 to late December 2017; $4,000 throughout 2020; $5,000 \nfrom January 2021 to mid-April 2021; and $10,000 since then). He had to make additional \nlarge lump-sum payments on a quarterly basis in amounts determined by the IRS. In recent \nyears, Applicant was no longer in a situation where he had to make a difficult decision to \neither pay his taxes when due or provide for his family. The issuance of a tax lien as \nrecently as January 2020 raises doubts that he may not comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations when his immediate interest is not imperiled. He still owes about $400,000 in \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfederal income taxes for TY 2016 and $800,000 for TY 2020. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not fully mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately falsified his \nNovember 2016 SF 86 by responding negatively to the financial inquiries regarding any tax \ndelinquency in the last seven years and any liens filed against his property in the last seven \nyears for failure to pay taxes or other debts. Specifically, the SOR alleges that Applicant \nfailed to disclose a March 2018 federal tax lien for $133,600 for taxes owed for TY 2015; a \nJuly 2007 federal tax lien for $57,100 for taxes owed for TY 2005; an October 2016 federal \ntax lien for $82,300 for taxes owed for TYs 2011, 2012, and 2014; a September 2011 state \ntax lien for $15,700 for taxes owed for TYs 2006 through 2009; a July 2010 federal tax lien \nfor $40,700 for taxes owed for TY 2007; a December 2009 federal tax lien for $17,400 for \nTYs 2006 and 2008; and a February 2008 state tax lien for $8,700 for TY 2002. Applicant \ndenies any intent to falsify his SF 86, asserting that he was unaware of any liens and that \nhe was making payments toward the taxes owed. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a falsification, it is not \nenough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers were not true or accurate. To \nraise security concerns under Guideline E, the responses must be deliberately false. In \nanalyzing an applicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider an applicant\u2019s \nanswers in light of the record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017). \nApplicant cannot be held to have failed to list the March 2018 federal lien that had \nnot yet been placed as of his November 2016 SF 86 or the February 2008 state lien that \nwas outside the seven-year scope of the SF 86 tax lien inquiry. However, four tax liens, \nthose entered in October 2016, September 2011, July 2010, and December 2009, were \nwithin seven years of his SF 86. There is no evidence that Applicant was ever notified of \nthe tax liens. \nHowever, a reasonable inference of deliberate falsification is warranted with respect \nto his denial of the SF 86 inquiry concerning failure to pay taxes as required within the last \nseven years. Liens are issued only after a failure to pay the taxes owed within the deadline \nset forth in a notice of taxes owed and demand for payment.

The \n$82,300 in federal income taxes for TYs 2011, 2012, and 2014 was assessed in 2015, and \nso were well within seven years of his SF 86. Tax liabilities totaling $58,100 were assessed \nduring the first half of 2009, beyond the seven-year scope of the SF 86 query, but the taxes \nwere not fully satisfied until 2018. It is unclear whether Applicant made any payments on \nthat debt before October 2016. The payment records in evidence date from October 18, \n2016, and show only four payments totaling $4,000 as of his November 18, 2016 SF 86. \nApplicant\u2019s current explanation for responding \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had failed to pay taxes \nwithin the last seven years is that he read the question as whether he failed to pay any \ntaxes. He would have the Government believe that since he made tax payments, albeit \nsometimes late, he thought the question did not require an affirmative response. His \nexplanation is not plausible in light of his education in finance; his business experience, \nincluding as a chief financial officer; his substantial tax delinquencies; and the ongoing \nnature of the problem. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. It provides: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nTwo of the seven potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 could have some \napplicability in this case. They are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of full candor when he completed his SF 86 is mitigated somewhat \nby the passage of time under AG \u00b6 17(c). However, the evidence against mitigation is more \npersuasive at this time. When Applicant was asked about the tax liens during his PSI, he \nadmitted that his tax problems were ongoing and had not yet been paid off, but he also \nclaimed that he was on a payment plan to resolve a tax lien from 2009. The October 2016 \ntax lien for $82,398 indicates that he was notified of the tax liabilities for 2011, 2012, and \n2014. He was less than fully forthcoming about his tax problems during his PSI, and it is \nnot a credible defense to state that the investigator did not ask for details. Even if he was \nunaware of the subsequent tax liens, he knew that his tax problems did not end when he \nwas a self-contractor.

The personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines F and E are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \nApplicant testified that his tax debts built up over time and that he addressed them \nwhen he had the funds. He is no longer the self-employed individual who could not pay his \ntaxes because of insufficient or inconsistent income. While he has paid off more than $3 \nmillion in taxes, he has not shown a significant change from the historically reactive \nmanner in which he addresses his taxes. Notwithstanding the difficulty in estimating his tax \nliability at times, he has taken S Corporation distributions on a quarterly basis while clearly \nnot paying enough in taxes on that income when he can afford to do so. Even after being \nplaced on notice by the DOD that his manner in handling his taxes is of concern to the \nDOD, he underpaid his federal income taxes for TY 2020 by almost $1.3 million, of which \n$800,000 is still owed. \nThe Appeal Board has made clear that voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems as those pertaining to paying taxes when required by law and not when or in a \nmanner personally advantageous is essential for protecting classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant at this time. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He \npreviously worked for another contractor from October 2018 to March 2021, but was laid \noff. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He is not married and has one seven-\nyear-old child. Applicant holds an interim security eligibility. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $29,000 in \nsix delinquent debts. His debts include a past-due car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a charged-off car \nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), 10 past-due Department of Education loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.m), and \nthree charged-off credit accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.p). The remaining Guideline F \nallegations include failure to file Federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 \nwhen due (SOR \u00b6 1.q); failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 \nwhen due (SOR \u00b6 1.r); and a $4,290 debt to the Federal government for delinquent taxes \nowed from tax year 2017. Finally, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to report his tax filing \nand payment delinquencies in his January 2019 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant admitted all \nof the SOR allegations with explanations. The government\u2019s exhibits support the SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant replied to government interrogatories in June and July 2021, and had not \nresolved his tax debts or filed in 2017 or 2018 tax returns by that time. Applicant testified \nat the hearing that he owed the IRS about $4,290 for tax year 2016. He did not have \nenough withheld from his pay, did not receive his W-2 forms, and had a mix up with his \nformer girlfriend over his ability to claim his daughter as a deduction. Applicant filed his \n2017 and 2018 tax returns in August 2020, and paid his debt through attachment of his \nfederal refunds for those years. Of note, Applicant provided a post-hearing exhibit from \nthe IRS showing a portion of his 2017 refund was applied to a 2015 debt, not 2016. He \nalso owed a state for taxes from 2016, and believes he satisfied the debt through \nattachment of his 2017 tax refund. After the hearing, Applicant attempted to contact the \nstate tax authority, but was unable to obtain a balance letter in time for his post-hearing \nreply. Applicant did not report any tax delinquencies or his failure to file his 2017 Federal \nand state tax returns when due, in his January 2019 SCA. His 2018 tax returns were not \nyet due when he completed his SCA. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has student-loan accounts that became past due totaling $6,858, in \nabout 2017. He testified that he contacted the loan servicing agency, and was requested \nto submit an income status document and report his income to the agency. He failed to \nsubmit the document or report his financial status changes since 2017. As a result of \nCOVID-19 related Executive Order in 2020, his student loans became deferred. They \nremain in a deferred status with no past-due amounts owed. \nApplicant has two past-due car loans. He purchased a 2007 BMW in 2014 for \n$16,000. He failed to make payments on the loan in 2017, and the car was repossessed \nin 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He was offered a settlement amount of $5,000, but he does not have \nthe funds to pay the debt or the settlement. Applicant bought another car in 2019 for \n$22,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He made payments on the loan in the first few months, then made \noccasional payments thereafter. He testified that his work hours were cut in 2020 due to \nCOVID-19, but did not provide evidence of a pay loss. He said he made a $1,200 payment \nin September 2021. He is past due about $10,000 or $11,000. \nApplicant has a credit card debt for about $1,062, listed in SOR \u00b6 1.o. The debt \nwas incurred while he was in college, and he did not pay anything beginning in 2015 or \n2016. In about June 2021, he started paying $15.85 per month in a payment plan with \nthe creditor. He provided post-hearing documentation showing he paid 6 of 67 \ninstallments as of October 2021. \nApplicant has two other consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.p), totaling about \n$1,621. He disputed the phone company debt (SOR \u00b6 1.p) in 2016, but it remains a past-\ndue debt on his 2020 credit report and Applicant was sent a collection letter. The $1,379 \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.n was opened in 2018 and charged off in 2019. The debt is reflected on \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 credit report. Applicant testified that he paid the balance of $400 in \nFebruary 2021. Nether debt appears on his 2021 credit report. \nApplicant earns about $101,000 per year, rents a home, and shares custody of his \ndaughter, but his daughter lives with her mother. He has no bank savings and no \nretirement account savings. He has about $200 in his checking account. He has not \nsought financial counseling. He traveled for pleasure to Jamaica in 2015 and 2018, to \nDominican Republic in 2019, to Jamaica in 2020, and Dominican Republic and Dubai \nUAE in 2021. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

His \nfinancial problems have been longstanding and remain a concern. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)). Applicant has not shown a willingness or ability to address his largest debts \ndespite a history of full employment since 2018 and a substantial salary. He has little in \nfinancial assets, yet has vacationed overseas on a regular basis. \nApplicant failed to file his 2017 and 2018 Federal and state tax returns when due, \nand incurred delinquent tax debts since 2015. Although he has paid his tax debts and \nfiled his tax returns, he did not do so in a timely manner, and satisfied his tax debts through \ninvoluntary relinquishment of future tax refunds. With regard to his education loans, they \nare currently deferred by law, however, Applicant did not take action as required to report \nhis financial status to the loan servicing agency as required in 2017 when his \ndelinquencies began. Although these accounts are no longer in a past-due status, \npayment requirements will eventually resume, but Applicant does not appear to have the \nfunds to pay, and given his reluctance to pay since 2017, these continue to concern me \nand reflect poorly on his financial responsibility. I will give him the benefit of the doubt on \nthe SOR allegations as written, as these debts are technically not past due, however I \ncontinue to have concerns about his overall financial responsibility. \nApplicant failed to resolve his two car loan debts, and has shown no inclination to \ndo so in the future. Applicant is credited with recently obtaining a credit card debt \nrepayment plan, but as of October 2021, compliance has only lasted 6 months out of a \n67-month plan. He has also appeared to have successfully disputed another account, \nand paid on a third. I will give him the benefit of the doubt regarding resolution of these \naccounts. \nI am unclear about Applicant\u2019s financial status as he earns a sizable income for a \nsingle individual with joint custody but not living with the child. He appears to have \nsufficient money to travel, but claims he has a total of $200 to spend. Overall, some debts \nhave been resolved or are not a current concern, however, Applicant\u2019s financial \nresponsibility overall is doubtful and has not been mitigated. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose on his SCA, his failure to file Federal and state tax \nreturns for tax year 2017, and failure to pay as required for previous tax years (2016), \ndespite being fully aware of the matter. The Appeal Board has cogently explained the \nprocess for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). The record evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally \nfalsified his 2019 SCA. The evidence shows that Applicant clearly was aware of the \nexistence of the tax issues when he completed his SCA, although he may not have been \naware of the exact total amount of taxes he owed. He did not adequately explain why he \nfailed to report the tax issues on his SCA, and did not provide documentary evidence to \nmitigate the allegation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNo mitigating condition applies. Applicant was well aware of his failure to file tax \nreturns and pay taxes, but failed to disclose them. This knowing and willful behavior is \nstrongly disfavored in security eligibility determinations. In addition, I am considering that \nhe did not voluntarily disclose the extent of his tax-related debts to include a 2015 Federal \ntax debt disclosed in his post-hearing submission, not for disqualification purposes but in \nmy evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility, mitigation, rehabilitation, and whole-person \nanalysis. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Overall, the personal conduct security concern is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

She took online \ncourses from 2015 until 2018, when she was in a car accident. She resumed taking \ncourses in September 2019. (Department Counsel\u2019s memo states Applicant started \nattended college courses in State A in August 2000, and attended courses continuously, \nat three different institutions until September 2012. Applicant\u2019s SCA, that she completed \nin September 2019, asked her to disclose her education history dating back ten years. \nShe disclosed attending two secondary institutions in State A, from September 2008 \nthrough September 2012, and her secondary schooling in State B.) (Item 2; Item 3; Item \n4) \nIn her 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed that her private student loans, totaling \n$136,576, had been charged off by her creditor after \u201cthey forced [her] into default [status] \nin 2014 when they found out [her] grandmother was dying.\u201d According to Applicant, the \nSOL applied to these loans, it had passed, and there was a pending lawsuit against the \ncreditor on behalf of borrowers like her. (Item 3 at 57) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator in October 2019, \nshe was questioned regarding the status of her private and federal student loans. She \ndisclosed that in 2014, she was unemployed, and her grandmother was sick; therefore, \nshe was unable to make payments toward her private student loans. The student loan \ncreditor did not offer her any payment plans; the accounts were placed in default status; \nand the balance on both loans were immediately due. Additionally, she claimed that the \nSOL applied to these loans; she did not have to pay the loans; she did not intend to make \nany payments; and she had never made any payments to either of the loans. (Item 4 at \n2) \nApplicant was living in State A when she opened the student loans alleged in the \nSOR. According to Applicant\u2019s August 2019 CBR, the $47,437 student loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, was \u201cassigned\u201d or opened in September 2007, and the $89,138 student loan \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was \u201cassigned\u201d or opened in January 2007.

(Item 5 at 9; Item 6 at 1-2; Item 7) \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant reiterated that she believed her private \nstudent loan debts were no longer valid due to a four-year SOL and her creditor\u2019s illegal \nbehavior. She provided no corroborating documentation to support these assertions. \n(Item 2) The SOL for private student loans in State A is ten years, and the SOL for private \nstudent loans in State B is four years. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant \nresided in State B prior to 2012, and the loans alleged in the SOR were incurred in 2007. \nAccording to her 2019 SCA, Applicant was unemployed during the following \nperiods: December 2012 to April 2013 (after she moved to State B); July 2013 to \nDecember 2014 (she indicated that she resigned from a position in July 2013 for another \nposition with a raise but was then unemployed for 18 months); and July 2017 to \nSeptember 2017.

(Item 3; Item 4)  \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s various periods of unemployment may have negatively affected her \nability to make payments toward her delinquent private student loans, which total over \n$136,000; however, she failed to demonstrate that she acted responsibly to address her \nstudent loans in response to her financial setbacks. During the period in which she was \nunemployed, she was married to her current husband and able to take extensive foreign \ntrips; therefore, in theory she should have been able to afford to negotiate a payment plan \nwith the creditor for her private student loans. She admittedly, never made a single \npayment toward these loans. She did not provide proof of any efforts to establish a \npayment plan, such as documents showing communications with the creditors. \nApplicant argued that her private student loans were resolved due to the statute of \nlimitations, and relied upon State B\u2019s four-year SOL. However, she did not provide proof \nthat the SOL for State A was not applicable in this case, as Applicant incurred these loans \nwhile residing and attending school in that jurisdiction. Applicant did not establish when \nshe was required to start payments on her student loans. Her student loan payments may \nhave been deferred while she was taking college courses. In state A, the SOL does not \nexpire until 10 years after her most recent payment was not made. Regardless, the DOHA \nAppeal Board has held that an applicant\u2019s reliance upon the statute of limitations as a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nrationale for not paying SOR creditors does not negate an Applicant\u2019s past conduct or \nfailure to take more aggressive actions to resolve her delinquent debts. \nApplicant provided no documentation to support her claims that her private student \nloan creditor behaved in an illegal manner when it defaulted her student loans. Nor did \nshe provide proof of any actions she took to try to resolve her student loans in a timely \nmanner or to resolve them after she regained employment in 2014. She told the \ngovernment investigator that she had never made any payments toward these loans, nor \ndid she intend to ever make any future payments toward these loans, indicating a lack of \na good faith effort to resolve these debts. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(e) \nwas not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

On July 24, 2020, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the \nSecurity Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DCSA \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a \ncontract with the DOD.

(Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 30, 2021, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on September 7, 2021. Her response was due on October 7, 2021. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of November 3, 2021, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on February 8, 2022. The record closed on \nNovember 3, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, most of the \nSOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.e.) as well \nas all of the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b., and 2.d. through \n2.j.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a customer service representative with her current employer since April 2018. She was \npreviously employed by other employers as an in-home service provider (March 2015 \u2013 \nDecember 2017), a position which she left because she was unable to furnish required \nsupport; as a customer service representative (July 2016 \u2013 July 2017), a position from \nwhich she was fired due to disagreements with her manager; and as a senior customer \nservice representative (August 2009 \u2013 September 2014), a position from which she was \nfired because she was unable to return from a leave of absence because she was \ndepressed. She was unemployed on several occasions: (December 2017 \u2013 March 2018), \nduring which she received unemployment compensation; (September 2014 \u2013 July 2016), \nduring which she received welfare and/or unemployment compensation; and (September \n2005 \u2013 August 2009), during which she received county assistance and/or unemployment \nbenefits. She is a 1995 high school graduate. She has never served with the U.S. military. \nShe has never been married. She has two children, born in 2000 and 2001. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated July 23, 2021); \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItem 3 (SF 86, dated April 18, 2018); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August 26, \n2021); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May 13, 2019); Item 6 (Combined Experian, \nTransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated May 12, 2018). \nIn her SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having several financial issues. She \nreported that she had a vehicle repossessed in 2014 and a credit-card account went to \ncollections after she lost her job and became homeless. She reported another delinquent \naccount, but disputed it. (Item 3 at 32-34) \nOn January 11, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management. During that interview, she verified the financial issues \nshe had previously reported in her SF 86. She is willing to pay her delinquent debts, but \nshe is residing in her car and cannot afford to make any payments. She stated that she \nhad never received any financial counseling or debt consolidation counseling. (Item 18 at \n7) \nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports from 2018 \u2013 2021 indicates that there are \nseveral delinquent accounts. In her Answer to the SOR, she acknowledged several \ndelinquent accounts. She offered no documentation, such as repayment agreements, \nstatements from creditors, receipts, or cancelled checks, to reflect any resolution efforts \neven though she has been with her current employer since April 2018. \nThe SOR alleged 15 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,982, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $11,409 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off. (Item 5 at 1) Applicant denied the allegation, but \nfailed to indicate the basis for her denial. (Item 2 at 1) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is an unspecified type of account that appears to be a loan with an \nunpaid balance of $872 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item \n4 at 2; Item 6 at 5) Although she previously said she was disputing the account, she \noffered no documentation to support the claimed dispute and failed to offer any \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt. The account has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a department store charge-account account with an unpaid balance \nof $431 that was placed for collection and charged off. (Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at \n6) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is an automobile loan for a vehicle that was repossessed leaving an \nunpaid balance of $5,707 that were placed for collection. (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 6) The \naccount has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is an unusual collection of 11 unpaid vehicle and penal code violation \nfines and fees generated over a multi-year period (2006 \u2013 2018) that Applicant has \nignored, totaling approximately $6,563. The violations and fines are as follows: March \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2006 ($733.61) for speeding, failure to appear, and failure to pay (Item 7); January 2007 \n($822.41) for speeding, current month and year tab not properly attached, following too \nclosely, and failure to pay (Item 8); February 2008 ($770) for mandatory use of safety \nbelts, mandatory use of safety belt or child system, and failure to pay (Item 10); May 2009 \n($591) for driving on a suspended or revoked license, and failure to pay (Item 11); June \n2012 ($675) for evasion of payment of fare, failure to appear, and failure to pay (Item 12); \nJuly 2012 ($710) for evasion of payment of fare, failure to appear, and failure to pay (Item \n13); March 2015 ($541) for red signal \u2013 vehicular responsibilities, and failure to appear \n(Item 14); June 2015 ($890) for no valid license in possession, failure to appear, and \nfailure to pay (Item 15); and June 2015 ($830) for improper use of preferential lanes, and \nfailure to pay (Item 16). (Items 7 through 17) Applicant\u2019s explanation for the violations was \nthat she just was not driving safely and always got tickets. She failed to list the violations, \nfines, and fees in her SF 86 because she had so many of them that she could not \nremember them all. (Item 18 at 6) The accounts have not been resolved. \nOther than her general promise made to the OPM investigator in January 2019, \nApplicant offered no indication that she intended to pay the bills or that she had made any \nefforts to do so since receiving the SOR. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. Applicant did not report her net \nmonthly income, her monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In the \nabsence of such information, I am unable to determine if she has any monthly remainder \navailable for savings or spending. In January 2019, she reported that she was homeless \nand was concentrating on survival. (Item 18 at 6) There is a paucity of evidence to indicate \nthat her financial problems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been. \nCriminal Conduct  \nAs noted above, over a multi-year period (2006 \u2013 2018) Applicant generated a \nnumber of vehicle and penal code violations, fines, and fees, totaling approximately \n$6,563. In addition to those 11 reported above, she was also charged with the following \noffenses: May 2007, she was charged with red signal \u2013 vehicular responsibilities, no \nevidence of current registration, failure to provide evidence of financial responsibility, no \nvalid license in possession, and failure to appear (Item 9); and in April 2018, she was \ncharged with speeding, failure to provide evidence of financial responsibility, and failure \nto appear (Item 17). Applicant offered no indication that she intended to resolve the \nviolations or pay the fines and fees, or that she had made any efforts to do so since \nreceiving the SOR. Those vehicle and penal code violations have not been resolved. \nDuring her OPM interview, Applicant acknowledged that because she had become \ndepressed over the deaths of her grandmother in 2011 and mother in 2012, as well as \nher breakup with the father of her children during the same period, she used marijuana \non a daily basis by herself or with friends until early 2013. She claimed that she was no \nlonger depressed, so she had no intentions to use marijuana in the future. (Item 18 at 7) \nThis conduct was not alleged in the SOR. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to such information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA. ADP I (critical-sensitive positions) \nand ADP II (non-critical sensitive positions) constitute such cases.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in \nthe record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 15 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,982. \nApplicant attributed her inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to her \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepeated periods of unemployment and the fact that she was homeless and residing in \nher car.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have \nbeen established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. On at least \ntwo occasions, Applicant was terminated from employment for cause \u2013 situations that \nwere not largely beyond her control. On 11 occasions, her disregard for the requirements \nof the vehicle and penal code caused her to violate those codes and generate substantial \nfines and fees. While she contended that she had disputed one of her reported delinquent \naccounts, she failed to offer a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of that delinquent \ndebt. Other than her general promise made to the OPM investigator in January 2019, she \noffered no indication that she intended to pay the bills or that she had made any efforts \nto do so since receiving the SOR, even though she has held full-time employment since \nApril 2018. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant offered no evidence of a good-faith effort to \ncontact her creditors, engage in efforts to resolve any of her delinquent debts, or make \nany payments. Between the date she was interviewed by the OPM investigator in January \n2019, and the date her response to the FORM was expected in October 2021, she made \nno claimed or verifiable efforts to address any of the delinquent debts. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored her delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. In fact, because of her cavalier attitude \nregarding the vehicle and penal code, she simply added to her delinquent debts. Because \nof her failure to confirm payment of even her smallest delinquent account (a $541 penal \ncode violation fine and fee) and her failure to furnish documentation regarding any of the \naccounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that her financial problems \nare not under control. She has not acted responsibly by failing to address her delinquent \naccounts while employed and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with her \ncreditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her public trust position is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that she has even begun making \nsuch efforts even after the SOR was issued in July 2020. \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered \nno specifics regarding any repayment efforts; submitted no documentary evidence to \nreflect any payments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one \ndelinquent debt has been resolved. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s in-action under the circumstances cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant\u2019s disregard of the vehicle and penal code has resulted in a substantial \nnumber of violations over a multi-year period. In fact, her violations occurred over more \nthan a decade. She clearly established a pattern of minor offenses, none of which \nindividually would affect her trustworthiness eligibility decision. However, she has made \nno attempt to resolve any of those violations. Accordingly, based on the pattern of actions \ndescribed above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant has a multiple-incident history of criminal \nconduct, commencing in March 2006 and continuing periodically until at least April 2018. \nShe was charged with a variety of vehicle and penal code violations, and was fined. She \nrepeatedly failed to appear, and continued generating more violations. Over that period, \nnothing seemed to work. \nGenerally, the passage of time without recurrence of additional criminal activity \ncan be construed as some evidence of successful rehabilitation. However, in this \ninstance, the most recent criminal activity was committed in 2018, but her continuing \nfailure to address any of her violations, pay her fines and fees, or appear in court as \npreviously required, indicate that the criminal conduct has not been addressed, resulting \nin no evidence of rehabilitation. While a person should not be held forever accountable \nfor misconduct from the past, in this instance the past is still relatively recent, and the \nconcerns about future criminal conduct, in light of the failure to address the past and \ncontinuing criminal conduct, are continuing. Applicant\u2019s past history of criminal conduct, \nunder the circumstances, continues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \ncustomer service representative with her current employer since April 2018. She is a 1995 \nhigh school graduate. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant was previously employed by other employers as an \nin-home service provider, a position which she left because she was unable to furnish \nrequired support; as a customer service representative, a position from which she was \nfired due to disagreements with her manager; and as a senior customer service \nrepresentative, a position from which she was fired because she was unable to return \nfrom a leave of absence because she was depressed. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to confirm any efforts to resolve her delinquent \naccounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that her financial problems \nare not under control. She was last reported to be homeless and living in her car, although \nshe has been gainfully employed since April 2018. She has not acted responsibly by \nfailing to address her delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make limited, \nif any, efforts of working with her creditors. There are lingering questions if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been. Moreover, her woeful record \nregarding her disregard of vehicle and penal code requirements resulting in repeated \nviolations, fines, and fees, as well as her failure or refusal to appear in court to resolve \nher violations, generate a continuing doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust.

The record was held open until April 18, 2022. \nApplicant timely submitted AE B through F, which were admitted without objection, and \nthe record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 58 years old. She has been married to her husband since 1995, and \nthey have three daughters who are young adults. She received a high school diploma in \n1982. She currently works as an administrative specialist, and she has worked for her \ncurrent employer, a DOD contractor since 2011. She has held a secret security since \n1982, and has worked for DOD contractors her entire career. (Tr.10-11, 16-19; GE 1) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she denied the $22,703 mortgage debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. She admitted both her 2008 and 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcies. Additionally, \nshe admitted that she failed to disclose her 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcy to her facility \nsecurity officer (FSO), as required. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a home equity loan opened in March 2007, for \nApplicant\u2019s current primary residence. At the hearing, she testified that this debt was \nincluded in her 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy; however, the bankruptcy documentation \nindicates the debt was reaffirmed at that time. In her post-hearing documentation, \nApplicant provided documentation from the creditor demonstrating that this debt was paid \nin full in April 2018. At that time, the mortgage was released, and the release was \nrecorded with the county. (Tr. 26-31, 40-43; GE 2 at 37; GE 3 at 23; GE 4 at 9; AE A; AE \nE) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started in late 2007. Her husband has been an over \nthe road (OTR) truck driver for most of his adult life. In 2007, they purchased a semi-truck \nfor him to become an owner/operator. Soon after they purchased the tractor trailer, the \nvehicle required repairs. Additionally, the fuel for the vehicle was very expensive, which \nleft very little money in their budget for food, gas, or other unexpected bills. During this \nperiod, Applicant\u2019s company lost the contract she was working on as well. Therefore, they \ndecided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. Their total unsecured liabilities were \njust under $83,000. Their debts were discharged in 2010, and she disclosed this \nbankruptcy to her FSO, as required. (Tr. 19-22, 25, 39; GE 2; GE 7; AE A; AE B) \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s husband told her he wanted a divorce. She went to see a \ndivorce attorney, and after reviewing her debts and her income, he told her she could not \nafford to remain in her marital home with her three children. At that time, her daughters \nwere between the ages of 14 and 19. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s attorney recommended that \nthey discharge their debts through bankruptcy before filing for divorce. They followed her \nhusband\u2019s attorney\u2019s advice and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August, 2016. Their \nunsecured liabilities totaled just over $45,000, and their debts were discharged in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember, 2016. Applicant and her husband chose to work on their marriage and \nultimately did not get divorced. (Tr. 22-25; GE 3; GE 7; AE A; AE B) \nIn 2016, Applicant disclosed her financial issues and bankruptcy to her supervisor, \nbecause she needed to take time off of work for various appointments. However, she did \nnot report the bankruptcy to her FSO due to \u201cpersonal humiliation, embarrassment, \n[related to her] husband\u2026asking for a divorce.\u201d At that time, she was more comfortable \ndisclosing her personal information to her supervisor than to her FSO. Additionally, she \nwas embarrassed that she was filing for bankruptcy a second time. (Tr. 31-32, 38-39; GE \n7; AE A) \nI\u2019ve worked with these people, or those people at the time, for many years. \nI was just humiliated. I still wasn\u2019t sure if we were going to stay married. It \nwas just bad judgment on my part, that\u2019s all I can say. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor recommended that she hold off on reporting the 2016 \nbankruptcy to their FSO until she was certain that she was going to file. \u201cAnd then things \ngot away from [Applicant] until the investigator came to interview [her]\u201d in December 2019. \nShe disclosed the 2016 bankruptcy to the investigator at that time, and it appears that \nshe did so before being confronted. She recognizes she made a serious mistake in not \nreporting the 2016 bankruptcy to her FSO, and she will not make a similar lapse in \njudgment. This is the lone mistake she has made in her 30-year career working as a DOD \ncontractor. (Tr. 33, 46; GE 7; AE A; AE B) \nApplicant does not have any current delinquent debt. She and her husband each \nearn approximately $62,000 annually. They follow a written budget and have a net \nmonthly remainder of over $3,200. They are able to live within their means and pay their \nbills. They have filed their state and federal tax returns in a timely manner the past five \nyears and do not owe any state or federal tax debt. She has attended credit counseling \nin conjunction with both of her bankruptcy filings. (Tr. 25-26; 34-37; GE 2; GE 3; GE 6; \nAE B; AE F) \nApplicant testified and provided a letter regarding the importance of her lengthy \ncareer working for DOD contractors. According to her last two employee performance \nevaluations, she is considered a valued employee who is reliable and consistently \nexceeds expectations. \u201cShe is quick to bring any security concerns or issues to our \nattention, which greatly reduces the opportunity for a security incident.\u201d (Tr. 33, 46; AE B-\nD). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Concerns \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant experienced personal financial issues related in large part to her \nhusband\u2019s past employment issues and their attorneys\u2019 recommendations pursuant to the \ndivorce he initiated in 2016. Although she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection twice \nwithin ten years, it was due to circumstances that were not within her control. In the \nintervening six years, she has worked to address her financial issues. Her efforts \ndemonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and the record evidence \ndemonstrates that the debt alleged in the SOR is resolved. \nApplicant follows a written budget and pays her current financial obligations. She \nis willing and able to live within her means, which is reflected in the testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence. Mitigation was established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that could raise a security concern and \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity official, relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or \nother official government representative;  \nApplicant failed to disclose her 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and discharge to \nher FSO. She disclosed it to her supervisor, but was ashamed and embarrassed to \ndisclose that her husband wanted a divorce, which was the cause of the bankruptcy. She \nwas also embarrassed that she was filing for bankruptcy for a second time. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Four of those conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant disclosed her 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy to her FSO, as required. She \ndisclosed her 2016 bankruptcy and financial issues to her supervisor. In 2019, when she \nwas interviewed by a Government investigator, she disclosed her financial issues, \nincluding her 2016 bankruptcy, before being confronted. \nApplicant credibly testified that she was remorseful for her lapse in judgment in \nfailing to disclose her 2016 bankruptcy to her FSO. Additionally, her statements that this \nbehavior will not be repeated, and it was an anomaly in a 30-year career were also \nsincere. \nThe performance evaluations submitted by Applicant demonstrate that she is a \nvalued and responsible employee. Despite the significance of her mistake, Applicant\u2019s \nsubsequent behavior is indicative of an individual who has taken positive steps to reduce \nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.

After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nat issue.

(Tr. 138) \nApplicant earned his high school diploma in June 2003 and has earned several \ncertifications in the IT field since graduating from high school. (GE 1; Tr. 73) He \nattended college classes, beginning in September 2019, and recently earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in network security (Tr. 104) Applicant enlisted in the Army in \nSeptember 2003 and served one month of active duty before being discharged under \nthe Army\u2019s early separation guidelines. (GE 1; Tr. 104) \n \nSince September 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as \na senior system administrator and more recently as a cloud compliance lead. (GE 1; Tr. \n73) For the past eight years, he has been involved professionally in the information \ntechnology (IT) field. Between June 2005 and September 2015, Applicant worked for \nother non-defense employers in various jobs. (GE 1)  \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and arrest-history \nApplicant was introduced to alcohol at the age 15 (mostly beer). (GE 2) \nAlcoholism runs in his family. (Tr. 109) From ages 18 to 22, he regularly consumed \nalcohol socially (mostly mixed drinks) and often drank to a level of intoxication in social \nsituations with co-workers and friends on weekends. (Tr. 111) \nBetween September 2011 and November 2018, Applicant was involved in three-\nalcohol-related incidents. (GEs 2-7 and AEs A-D; Tr. 75-102) In September 2011, after \nhanging out and drinking with a friend at a party, he was stopped by police for a cited \ninoperable license plate. (GE. 2) After administering a field sobriety test of Applicant, the \nofficer arrested Applicant and charged him with DUI, DUI per se, and driving while \nimpaired by alcohol. Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI per se and received probation. \n(GEs 1-2 and 7) His probation conditions included a requirement that he complete an \nalcohol substance abuse class. (GE 7) \nFollowing his 2011 DUI incident, Applicant ceased drinking for approximately \nthree years before resuming his consumption, mostly in social situations. (GE 2 and \nAEs A and D) In February 2017, Applicant had consumed alcohol socially with friends to \nthe point of intoxication before driving home (Tr. 114). While driving at a high rate of \nspeed, he was stopped by a police officer who noticed Applicant\u2019s tires were spinning. \n(GE 6) Noting a strong smell of alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath, in addition to glassy, \nbloodshot eyes, the officer administered standard field sobriety tests on Applicant. \nCiting Applicant\u2019s test failures, the officer administered a preliminary breath test. Test \nresults produced a blood alcohol content (BAC) percentage of .14 per cent. Based on \nthese test results, the officer arrested and charged Applicant with DUI, DUI per se, \ndriving while impaired by alcohol, and driving while so far impaired by alcohol that he \ncould not drive safely. (GE 5) \nAppearing in court on his 2017 DUI charges, Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI per \nse and was sentenced to, inter alia, four days of confinement, and payment of a fine. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(GE 4). Following his DUI incident, Applicant abstained from alcohol for a year before \nresuming his alcohol consumption in 2018. (GEs 2 and 5) \nIn November 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and other \nalcohol-related charges after being questioned at the scene of an accident involving \nApplicant. (GEs 2-4 and AEs A and D). Before leaving a restaurant for home, Applicant \nconsumed three beers and two martinis with friends without feeling intoxicated. (Tr. 126-\n129) Arrest reports confirm that Applicant declined to take a sobriety test at the scene \nand was arrested and charged with four related counts of DUI. (Tr. 126-127) At the \nrequest of arresting police at the scene, Applicant was escorted home by a neighbor. \n(GE 4) In court, Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI in January 2019 and was sentenced to, \ninter alia, two years of confinement (all but 90 days suspended), mandatory outpatient \nalcohol treatment, and probation through August 2021. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D) \nIn compliance with his 2018 DUI treatment requirements, Applicant enrolled in an \noutpatient alcohol counseling and treatment program in January 2019. (AE A) While his \ntreatment counselors did not diagnose him with any form of alcohol disorder, they did \nrecommend his enrollment in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and abstain from drinking for \nthe duration of the program. (AE A; Tr.130) The program ran for 26 weeks over a six-\nmonth period (2019-2021), during which time Applicant abstained from all alcoholic \nbeverages. (AE A; Tr.130) Applicant successfully completed his 26-week alcohol \ntreatment program in September 2019. (AE A). His program counselors credited him \nwith consistent attendance and active, significant, and introspective group participation. \n(AE A) \nDuring his 2019 counseling and treatment program, he was administered three \nrandom drug screens, all of which returned negative results in every drug classification \n(including alcohol). To reinforce his lifestyle changes and the need for total abstinence, \nhis program counselors recommended weekly support meetings for a minimum of three \nmonths following his discharge. (AE A) Applicant accepted and complied with the \nprogram\u2019s abstinence recommendations and weekly support meetings and was credited \nwith successfully completing the program in September 2019. (AE E; Tr. 145-146) \nFollowing his enrollment in his 26-week outpatient program in January 2019, \nApplicant essentially abstained from alcohol. While he was not recommended to abstain \nfrom alcohol entirely by the substance abuse counselor he consulted with in a post-\ndischarge counseling session in September 2021, she did enter a 10-point score from \nthe Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) she administered to Applicant in her \ncounseling session with him. His counselor was able to neutralize this high point score \nby characterizing it as a reflection of his past DUI incidents that did not necessarily \ncorrelate with the abstinence he practiced since his las DUI incident in 2018. (AE D; Tr. \n148) Crediting Applicant with over two years of sustained abstinence, his counselor \nassigned a positive prognosis to Applicant\u2019s ability to keep his alcohol consumption \nunder control. (AE D)  \nSince his 2018 DUI incident, Applicant he has consumed alcohol on only two \noccasions: once in January 2019 and once in a toast at his wedding in October 2021. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. 30-36, 129-130) He has attended AA meetings regularly between January 2019 and \nAugust 2021, and with the support of his spouse and support groups (inclusive of AA), \nhe has maintained his sobriety (save for the two cited exceptions).

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nAlcohol Consumption \n  The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the \nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 21. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

All of his DUIs arrests were followed by Applicant \nguilty pleas and imposed sentences. On the strength of the evidence documented in the \nrecord, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply: \nDCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the \nindividual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,\u201d and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder,\u201d are applicable to the facts of record \nin Applicant\u2019s case. \nEvaluation by Applicant\u2019s substance abuse counselors in 2019, and again in \n2021 in a post-discharge session, produced no diagnostic alcohol assessment, but \ncredited Applicant with a positive prognosis that took into account his past two-plus \nyears of abstinence and offered a positive impression of his ability to sustain his \nabstinence in the future. By all reported accounts, Applicant has fulfilled the promise \nand expectations his counselor placed in him and has maintained his continued \nabstinence from all alcohol products. \nWhile alcohol abuse disorder has been held by the Appeal Board to pose a risk \nthat a person under the influence of alcohol could mishandle or fail to properly \nsafeguard classified information (see ISCR Case No. 95-0731 at 3 (App. Bd.

The \ncase was assigned to me on November 3, 2021. On January 14, 2022, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for February 10, 2022. The hearing was to take place \nthrough use of an on-line platform. \nThe hearing initially convened as scheduled. Both sides presented exhibits and \nApplicant began his testimony. However, the quality of the video feed was poor, and the \naudio connectivity was sporadic, leading to several disconnections. This was sufficiently \ndisruptive that, with mutual consent, I suspended the February 10 hearing during \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, and resumed the hearing in person on February 22, 2022. I note \nthat the in-person hearing afforded me an appropriate opportunity to observe \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and assess his credibility. \nDuring the first hearing, Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5. Applicant objected to GE 2, a credit report, on grounds of inaccuracy, \nbut the objection was overruled. (Tr. 19) The remaining Government Exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through M, \nall admitted without objection. (AE A through AE I had been submitted previously, along \nwith his answer.) Applicant also testified. His testimony resumed at the start of the \nsecond hearing. He also submitted six additional exhibits, which were marked together \nas AE N and admitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documentation. With an e-mail (AE O), he submitted \nadditional documents: AE P (regarding his student loans with creditor A); AE Q (student \nloans with creditor N); AE R (student loans with creditor NN); AE S (DD-214); and AE T \n(rating decision from the VA) that are marked as noted and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the first transcript (1Tr.) on February 18, 2022 and the second transcript \n(2Tr.) on March 1, 2022. The record closed on March 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the alleged debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.p) with explanations and some documents. His explanations are incorporated into my \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 41 years old. He and his wife separated in April 2015.

As the Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \nsecurity [and trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of public trust, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding sensitive \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise financial trustworthiness concerns.\nThe following are applicable, given the established evidence of Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent student loans and credit-card debts:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nTwo debts are not established. The small medical debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n, \nwhich Applicant denied and said he does not recognize, are listed on a 2019 credit \nreport but are not sufficiently identified so that he can attempt to resolve them. As \nmedical debts, they are also likely attributable to a reasonable circumstance even if \nproperly identified. I resolve them for Applicant. \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes potentially applicable \nmitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 20: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant incurred student-loan debt while pursuing a college degree and some \nlater studies. He experienced several years of employment instability after leaving the \nAir Force. He incurred credit-card debts for living expenses, and by his own admission, \nhe was financially irresponsible. His mother died suddenly and tragically in a house fire, \nand he experienced depression and anxiety related to his separation from his wife. He \nis also a disabled veteran with PTSD, and is in counseling. These factors are given \nsome consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b) even though, as Applicant acknowledges, his \ndebts are largely due to his negligence and financial irresponsibility. \nApplicant has been gainfully employed, with an annual salary of about $90,000, \nsince late 2019. Once he regained stable employment, he rehabilitated his student \nloans in good faith. AG \u00b6 20(d) therefore has some application. He is now making \npayments on his private loans and intends to renew payments on his federal loans once \nthe COVID-19 forbearance period ends. He did not responsibly address his consumer \ndebts until after receiving the SOR, but he documented that he has paid or settled all of \nthose debts. He is in a more financially stable position going forward and has a \nresponsible plan to address his remaining student loan debt. AG \u00b6 20(a) therefore \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or position of public trust by considering the \ntotality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative \njudge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s prior \nservice to the country, in the Air Force, in the intelligence field, with a Top Secret/SCI \nclearance, as well as his status as a service-connected disabled veteran. While this is \nnot dispositive, it is whole-person evidence that weighs in his favor. Applicant also \ndocumented the payment and resolution of many of his debts, and showed that his \nfinancial situation has improved along with his stabilized employment, as has his \nacceptance of his financial responsibilities. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s access to \nsensitive information. Eligibility for access to sensitive information and a position of \npublic trust is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

She married in \n1981, divorced in 1991, remarried in 1992, divorced in 2000, remarried in 2003, and \ndivorced in 2006. She has an adult daughter and three adult grandchildren. She \ngraduated from high school in 1977 and attended college but did not earn a degree. She \nhas owned her home since 1999. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-23; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has worked for various DOD contractors since approximately 2000. She \nwas unemployed in 2013. After a layoff, she was again unemployed from December 2014 \nto January 2015. She then worked part time, as a designer for an event center, from May \n2015 to February 2016, when she was again laid off. She was unemployed from \nNovember 2015 to April 2016. Since 2016 and as of the date of the hearing, she worked \nas an information specialist for her employer, a DOD contractor. She has also worked \npart time, as a cashier at an arts and crafts store, since 2007. She was first granted a \nsecurity clearance in approximately September 2011. (Tr. at 7-9, 23-24, 26-27, 29, 53-\n54; GE 1, 2)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax \nreturns for at least tax years (TY) 2014 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b). The SOR also \nalleged that Applicant had three delinquent consumer accounts totaling $42,609 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c, 1.d, 1.e). The SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her \nAnswer, March 2018 security clearance application (SCA), 2018 and 2019 background \ninterviews, 2020 response to interrogatories, and credit bureau reports from 2018, 2019, \nand 2021.

She consequently did not provide her tax preparer with the \nrequired documentation so that her tax preparer could timely file her income tax returns \nfor TY 2013 to 2018. She acknowledged during her October 16, 2018 background \ninterview that her inability to pay her tax advisor also affected her ability to file her income \ntax returns since 2013. She testified that she also did not timely file her federal and state \nincome tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020, because she was waiting for her tax preparer \nto first file her income tax returns for TY 2013 to 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 26, 34-53, 60-62; \nGE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that she has worked with a tax advisor since approximately \n2009. She testified that her tax preparer filed her federal and state income tax returns for \nTY 2013 to 2018 in June 2021, and her federal and state income tax returns for TY 2019 \nand 2020 in August 2021. She did not provide corroborating documentation. She testified \nthat she was unsure how much she owed in federal taxes; she believed she owed $2,000 \nin state taxes; and her tax preparer was assisting her with negotiating payment plans with \nboth the IRS and the state tax authority to resolve any outstanding taxes. She testified \nthat as of the date of the hearing, all of her federal and state income tax returns had been \nfiled. She also testified that she expected to pay taxes on money she withdrew from her \nindividual retirement account (IRA) in 2016 when she was unemployed, and in 2022 to \nrepair her roof. (Tr. at 42-53, 61-62, 65; GE 2; AE A) \nApplicant attributed her delinquent consumer debts to the above-mentioned \nperiods of unemployment; four unexpected car repairs from around 2014 to 2018 that \ncost between $200 and $800; $1,800 in medical expenses related to a dental condition \nbetween 2014 and 2018, and an immune system disorder diagnosed in around 2016; \nreplacement of her HVAC system in 2020, for which she was on a $300 monthly payment \nplan as of the date of the hearing; and providing needed financial assistance to both her \nmother and her daughter. (Answer; Tr. at 26, 34-44, 53-54, 59, 65-66; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that she attempted to work with her creditors from approximately \n2015 to 2018 to resolve her delinquent consumer debts, but she made little progress \nbecause she could only make nominal monthly payments while interest continued to \naccrue. On the advice of her bank, she consulted with Accelerated Financial Services \n(AFS) in January 2014 in an attempt to resolve her delinquent debts. In October 2018, \nshe entered her three consumer debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, into a debt \nconsolidation plan with AFS. She also included in her debt consolidation plan four debts \nthat are not alleged in the SOR. She testified that she paid approximately $1,500 monthly \ninto her debt consolidation plan for one year, and then $50 monthly since. Documentation \nfrom AFS reflects that Applicant has made timely payments into her plan. (Tr. at 29-34, \n54-60, 63; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $13,402 charged-off account.

(GE 5; AE \nA)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $12,106 charged-off credit card. As previously discussed, \nApplicant included this debt in her debt consolidation plan with AFS. An IRS Form 1099-\nC reflects that the creditor cancelled this credit card debt in December 2017. (Tr. at 58; \nGE 5; AE A) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s net monthly income was approximately \n$4,500. She also earned $12.25 hourly from her part-time employment, where she \nworked 12 hours weekly as of the date of the hearing. She testified that her monthly net \nremainder, after expenses, was $100. She was seeking additional part-time employment \nin an effort to resolve her debts, to include her outstanding taxes. She had $7,000 in her \nIRA that she had been contributing to since 2016. She testified that she did not use credit \ncards. She testified that she was current on her mortgage, for which she paid $1,400 \nmonthly. She also testified that she developed a budget for her income and expenses, \nand she understood the importance of timely filing her future federal and state income tax \nreturns. She has not received credit counseling. She traveled to Jamaica for tourism in \nJune 2009 and June 2011, and she also traveled to Mexico for tourism in June 2011. (Tr. \nat 22-29, 53, 62-67; GE 1; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. She also failed to timely file her federal \nand state income tax returns for TY 2014 through 2018. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIt is well established that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant \nhas difficulty with abiding by government rules and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). It is also well established that the mere filing of \npast-due returns or resolution of delinquent tax debts does not compel a favorable \nsecurity-clearance adjudication. ISCR Case No. 17-01907 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). The \ntiming of corrective action is an important factor in determining whether security concerns \nraised by tax delinquencies are mitigated. Applicants who wait until their clearances are \nin jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she \nmust provide evidence that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. Applicant \nprovided documentation reflecting that SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e were canceled in 2019 \nand 2017, respectively. She intends to continue to pay into her debt consolidation plan to \nresolve SOR debt \u00b6 1.c. I find that \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e. \nApplicant has worked with a tax advisor since 2009. She failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate her claims that she filed her federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2014 through 2018, or reached a payment arrangement with the IRS or the \nstate tax authority to resolve any outstanding taxes associated with those and other tax \nyears for which she failed to timely file her income tax returns.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c - e: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He went to the IRS, date \nunspecified, and they informed him he did not owe any taxes, but advised him to file his \ntax returns in order to get refunds due him.

At the time he was required to file his 2010 return, he was unemployed from \nDecember 2010 to December 2011, and responsible for supporting his mother and \nbrother. His mother was ill from cancer, and recently passed away.

(Tr. 25-27, 35\u00ad\n38, 41) (Note \u2013 During his testimony, it became clear that Applicant had difficulty with \nhis memory, especially when it came to recalling dates.) And, in January 2019, he \nsustained a severe knee injury that required surgery. His Workman\u2019s Compensation \nclaim was delayed, and he was unable to pay his rent and meet his expenses leading to \nhis being evicted from his apartment. He stated, \u201cThe knee surgery . . . occurred at my \ncurrent position and, again, wiped me out.

In 2010, he had a \u201ccustom painter\u2019s mentality of bouncing around from job to \njob trying to make as much money as possible instead of being more responsible with a \n9:00 to 5:00 and seeing the benefits of long-term employment and a more conservative \nsimple lifestyle.\u201d (Tr. 28) He added that he does not travel, date, or go out anymore. \n\u201cLiterally nothing. All I do is focus on taking care of these issues that I already admitted I \nhad before I received the SOR. I was already working on them.\u201d (Tr. 28-29) \nApplicant self-reported his late tax filings to his Facility Security Officer (FSO), \nwho gave him \u201ca list of items to take care of.\u201d (Tr. 29) Going forward, Applicant meets \nhis tax filing deadlines by \u201cpreparing for them the year before, just like last year\u2019s taxes.\u201d \n(Tr. 29) He stated that he has \u201cdeveloped a friendship with the manager over at [his tax \npreparer] and I have an accountant on call that would help me prepare last year\u2019s \ntaxes.\u201d (Tr. 30, 43-44, 48) Applicant\u2019s financial situation has improved over the past two \nyears. He has been able to remain in his current residence since 2020 and is current on \nall of his monthly bills. He has opened a 401(k) and a Roth IRA. (Tr. 49-50) Although \nnot alleged, Applicant provided documentation evidencing that he researched and paid \nsome outstanding parking tickets dating back to around 2004.

Suffice it to \nsay, the list is quite exhaustive. (Tr. 26) As a Government contractor master painter, he \nis paid $40 per hour. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant submitted two reference letters: (1) from his paint shop supervisor \n(PSS); and (2) a fellow aircraft painter (AP) coworker. PSS stated that in the last two \nyears Applicant has proven to be one of his outstanding employees, describing him as a \nteam player, willing to give a helping hand, and works with very limited supervision. He \nadded that Applicant is always punctual and is a pleasure to have him in his shop. AP \nhas known Applicant for four years stating he is best known for his honesty and deep \nrespect for others. He is a subject matter expert in his craft and helped him transition \nfrom his last job to his present job.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances.

Further inquiry is necessary about the potential application of any mitigation \nconditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nOf concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file his 2010, 2016, and 2017 \nFederal and state income tax returns. Contrary to the SOR allegations, he did timely file \nhis 2018 Federal and state income tax returns. The initiation of the clearance process \napparently motivated Applicant to address his outstanding tax filing requirements. He \nwas well on his way to having his tax filing requirements resolved by the time of his April \n2019 OPM PSI, and he completed all of those requirements by the time he answered \nhis SOR on June 26, 2020. \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that his failure to file his Federal and state \nincome tax returns was a concern to the Government when he began the clearance \nprocess. From the onset, his FSO helped guide him through the process by identifying \nproblematic areas. Applicant heeded that advice and by the time he answered his SOR, \nhe had filed all of his delinquent Federal and state income tax returns. He has timely \nfiled his tax returns for subsequent years, so the problem has not been repeated. \nApplicant\u2019s work and residence history before beginning his current job was that \nof a \u201ccustom painter\u2019s mentality of bouncing around from job to job trying to make as \nmuch money as possible\u201d before settling down to a stable job such as what he has now. \nApplicant described certain events that impacted his financial situation to include his \n2010 unemployment, the financial stress of supporting his brother and his mother \ndiagnosed with cancer, a severe 2017 motorcycle accident that impacted his memory \nand cognitive skills, and a 2019 knee injury. Applicant recognized that he is not \nsophisticated when it comes to matters such a filing his income tax returns and to that \nend has engaged the services of a professional tax preparer. Since beginning his \ncurrent job with a Government contractor, his life has gained a sense of stability and \npurpose he otherwise has not had. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances.

AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old aircraft painter, who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since August 2018. He needs to retain his Secret security clearance to \ncontinue his current employment. Applicant admittedly fell behind on his Federal and \nstate tax filing requirements. He recognizes that and has done everything possible to \ncorrect his past missteps and taken preventive action to prevent similar missteps from \nreoccurring. \nApplicant has not had what many would refer to as a traditional career path. He \nnever graduated from high school, but did earn his GED. He was gifted with \nconsiderable creative talent as an artist and painter. For the early part of his working life \nhe moved to various locations wherever his talent and skills were in demand. His \npainting skills varied to include appearing on television shows, being featured in trade \nmagazines, being commissioned to create a painting for foreign dignitaries, painting \nmurals in nationally known museums, and custom painting motorcycles and \nautomobiles for celebrities. \nApplicant utilizes those skills in his current position as an aircraft painter for \nmilitary aircraft. While his lifestyle may have changed from being on the move to one of \npredictability, his ability to utilize those skills in support of the national defense remains \nconstant. In short, Applicant\u2019s extraordinary skills and ongoing contribution to the \nnational defense by skillfully painting military aircraft are recognized by his supervisor \nand coworker and are an asset to the national defense. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful \nconsideration of the whole-person factors and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n      \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

On \nJune 28, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On August 9, 2022, DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing, setting the hearing for September 19, 2022.

(Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered \nthree exhibits; there were no objections; and I admitted all proffered exhibits. (Tr. 15-23; \nGE 1-GE 6; AE A-AE C) On September 28, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of his \nsecurity clearance hearing. Applicant provided four exhibits after the hearing, which were \nadmitted without objection. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) D-AE G) The record closed on October \n20, 2022. (Tr. 75) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted each of the SOR allegations. He also \nprovided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nAdditional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old security architect, and he has worked for his current \nemployer for 26 months. (Tr. 6, 8-9) In 1983, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6-7) In \n1988, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 7) He has never served in the military. \n(Tr. 7) In 1988, he was married, and in 2002, he was divorced. (Tr. 7-8) He has eight \nchildren who are ages 10, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, and 32. (Tr. 8) He does not pay, and he \nhas not received, child support payments. (Tr. 29) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to having eight children, and three \nchildren are currently attending college. (Tr. 24; SOR response) They have scholarships; \nhowever, he pays the following annual amounts: $14,000; $2,700; and $6,300. (Tr. 30, \n56-57) The $14,000 is for his daughter\u2019s law school room and board. (Tr. 56) He wanted \nall of his children to complete college without student loans. (Tr. 57) \nIn 2015, Applicant purchased a car for about $300,000 to $320,000. (Tr. 64) He \neventually sold it for the amount remaining on his vehicle loan of $167,000.

(Tr. 26) He was unsure about his income from 2018 to 2020; however, \nhe believed one year it was under $100,000 and the other year it was not. (Tr. 27, 53) \nFrom 2016 to 2018, his annual salary was $225,000 to $250,000. (Tr. 27) From 2011 to \n2016, his annual salary was about $200,000. (Tr. 28) He has about $40,000 in stock \nmarket assets in his retirement account. (Tr. 54-55) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant owes about $54,997 to the federal government for \ndelinquent taxes for tax year (TY) 2005. Applicant was a 1099 employee, and he failed to \npay quarterly taxes. (Tr. 31, 60-61) He had custody of his three youngest children since \n2013. Their mother claimed them on her tax return. (Tr. 24) He was able to convince the \nIRS that he should be the parent authorized to take the dependent deduction for the three \nchildren. (Tr. 24, 31) He received a letter from the IRS in 2015 or 2016. (Tr. 61) He \npresented a April 23, 2018 IRS letter to the Office of Personnel Management investigator \nindicating he owed $54,997 to the IRS for TY 2005. (GE 5 at 10) His federal income tax \noverpayments for TYs 2016 and 2017 were applied to address his TY 2005 debt. (Id.) \nYear-after-year he ignored his federal income tax debt. (Tr. 62) \nApplicant contacted the IRS in 2020 about his tax debt because he was seeking a \nsecurity clearance from another government agency (AGA); in 2020, he made an offer in \ncompromise; and in 2020, he paid his federal income tax debt. (Tr. 24, 32-33, 61-62) He \ndid not receive his AGA employment because he did not timely complete their security \nclearance application. (Tr. 66) He did not remember how much he paid the IRS; however, \nhe estimated it was about $13,000. (Tr. 32, 63) Department Counsel asked him to provide \nevidence of his payments; however, he did not provide it. (Tr. 33) He sent an IRS account \nrecord, which shows zero balances for TYs 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, and as of \nSeptember 18, 2020, he had a zero balance. (AE A at 1, 10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off account for a vehicle for $23,713. Applicant \npurchased a 2016 vehicle for his business, which was repossessed. (Tr. 34-35) He \nadmitted that purchase of the vehicle showed poor judgment. (Tr. 37) He said he sold a \ndifferent vehicle, and he applied about $12,000 to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 37) \nHowever, the $12,000 payment may have been applied to the debt for a repossessed \nvehicle in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He has not been discussing settlement with the creditor for the SOR \n\u00b6 1.b debt, and he did not make any other payments to address this debt. (Tr. 38, 40) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a charged-off account for $20,726. In May of 2018, he \npurchased a vehicle. (Tr. 38) He stopped making payments in August of 2019, and the \nvehicle was repossessed in late 2019. (Tr. 38) His credit report shows the balance for the \ndebt is now $5,466, and he plans to pay $2,700 to settle the debt by the end of 2022. (Tr. \n39-40; AE A at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a charged-off credit card debt for $14,588. Applicant\u2019s son \ncharged some games on the account, and Applicant disputed the debt. (Tr. 41) The \ncreditor sought a judgment, and on October 24, 2016, the court dismissed the creditor\u2019s \nlawsuit without prejudice. (Tr. 41; SOR response at 2) The debt appears on Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 2021 Equifax credit report with the narrative code \u201cCharged Off Account, \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccount Closed By Credit Grantor.\u201d (GE 4 at 8) This debt does not appear on his October \n20, 2022 TransUnion current credit report. (Tr. 42; AE A) This debt is mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off credit card account for $4,985. Applicant said the \ncredit card company erroneously paid for a rental car for several months after he returned \nthe vehicle, and he disputed his responsibility to pay the debt. (Tr. 44; SOR response at \n3-4) He said the creditor offered to settle the debt for $1,496, and he intended to settle \nthe debt by the end of 2022. (Tr. 40, 44-45; AE C) On October 20, 2022, the creditor \nconfirmed a settlement agreement of 12 monthly $125 payments beginning in November \n2022. (AE D at 9-10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a charged-off account for $1,138. Applicant said he did not \nremember the account. (Tr. 45) His credit reports reflect that the account was opened in \nOctober 2012, and his last payment was in March 2016. (Tr. 45) He called the creditor; \nhowever, he was unable to get the information he needed to resolve the debt. (Tr. 46) \nApplicant said he was going to dispute the account. (Tr. 45) The debt shows on his credit \nreport as having a zero balance. (Tr. 46; AE A at 5; SOR response at 1, 5; GE 4 at 4) This \ndebt is mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges an account placed for collection for $435. Applicant paid this \ndebt. (Tr. 46) His September 2021 Equifax credit report narrative code states, \u201cAccount \nClosed At Consumer\u2019s Request, Consumer Disputes After Resolution, Account Paid For \nLess Than Full Balance.\u201d (GE 4 at 6) This debt is mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a judgment entered in November 2015 for about $2,000. \nApplicant\u2019s landlord obtained the judgment for repairs. (Tr. 47-48) He said he paid the \njudgment, and he said he would provide proof of payment. (Tr. 48-49) However, he did \nnot provide proof of payment or satisfaction of this judgment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a judgment for a utility bill entered in November 2016 for about \n$448. Applicant said he paid the judgment, and he provide a utility bill for October 2021 \nindicating he owed a monthly utility bill of $74. (SOR response at 1, 5) He contended the \ncreditor would not have given him a new account if there was an outstanding judgment \nowed to the creditor. (Tr. 50) Applicant said he could obtain proof of payment; however, \nhe did not provide evidence from the creditor showing payment. This debt is mitigated \nbecause he has an account in current good standing with the creditor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a judgment entered in July 2017 for about $12,340, which was \nobtained by a landlord because of damage to a residence he was renting. (Tr. 50-51) \nApplicant said he settled the debt for $6,000. He said he paid the debt using money \norders. (Tr. 51) He did not retain copies of the money orders. (Tr. 67) The landlord is in \nKorea. (Tr. 51) \nIn 2022, Applicant enrolled in a credit counseling course, and he generated a \nbudget. (AE E; AE F; AE G) His monthly remainder or surplus which is available to pay \nthe SOR debts is $4,451.

(Tr. 69) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the disqualifying conditions and the \napplicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant indicated a circumstance beyond his control which adversely affected \nhis finances. He had periods of unemployment, underemployment, and a failed business. \nHe took responsibility for financially supporting his eight children. However, \u201c[e]ven if [an \napplicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the \napplicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether \nhe or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments \nto keep debts current. Applicant did not provide supporting documentary evidence that \nhe consistently maintained contact with the IRS and several creditors. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant purchased a car in 2015 for about \n$300,000 to $320,000 while owing thousands of dollars to the IRS for TY 2005. In ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \n \n \nId.

The \nnon-SOR allegation will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.

Feb. 17, 2017)). \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. \nAccordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on \nan applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nApplicant has known about his delinquent tax debt of about $55,000 for TY 2005 \nfrom his filing date in 2006 until resolution in 2020. The only known payments were \noverpayments for other TYs, which were transferred to address his TY 2005 debt. He did \nnot describe any other payments between 2006 and 2020. He has not established \nmitigation of his federal income tax debt for TY 2005 because he was dilatory in his \nresolution of this debt when he had the means to resolve this debt earlier. He did not \nprovide a reasonable explanation for his 2015 purchase of a car for $300,000 to $320,000 \nwhen he had an outstanding federal income tax debt. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d for $14,588, \u00b6 1.f for $1,138, 1.g for $435, and 1.i for \n$448 are mitigated. However, it is noteworthy that only the debts for $435 and $448 were \npaid, despite Applicant having ample financial resources. \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating his other SOR debts. He did not provide \nproof of payments, such as receipts for payment, a letter from the creditor, or debits from \nhis accounts. \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make more progress sooner in \nthe resolution of his SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems \nare being resolved. His handling of his finances raises unresolved questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Under \nall the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old security architect, and he has worked for his current \nemployer for 26 months. In 1983, he graduated from high school. In 1988, he was \nawarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. In 1988, he was married, and in 2002, he was divorced. \nHe has eight children who are ages 10, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, and 32. \nApplicant did not provide a good reason for his procrastination in failing to pay or \nestablish payment plans for several years for his federal income tax debt for TY 2005 in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. His resolution of his federal income tax debt in 2020 was responsible; \nhowever, full mitigation credit is unavailable in light of his income over the last seven \nyears, and his purchase of a car for $300,000 to $320,000 in 2015. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off account for a vehicle for $23,713. SOR \u00b6 1.c \nalleges a charged-off account for $20,726, and his credit report shows the balance for the \ndebt is now $5,466. SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a judgment entered in July 2017 for about $12,340. \nThese three debts alone total about $40,000. He did not provide documentation showing \nany recent payments to address these three debts. He has not recently communicated \nwith the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b. At his hearing, documentation showing resolution was \nrequested; however, it was not provided. The fact that a debt is dropped from a credit \nreport does not necessarily show the debt is resolved. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of timely paying his debts, and a \nbetter record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied both allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He has not been married and has two adult children, ages 24 and 25. He has been employed by his present employer since 2017. The financial allegations alleged in the SOR are supported by Applicant\u2019s statements in his May 2018 security clearance application (SCA), his answer to the SOR, his statements made to a government investigator in May 2019, and credit bureau reports (CBR) from November 2021 and August 2018. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has child-support arrearages totaling approximately $39,884. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that the same child-support arrearage currently alleged was previously adjudicated at a security clearance hearing in 2010, at which time the balance was $28,000. At that hearing, he presented evidence that he had established a payment plan to address the debt in which $400 would be automatically withheld from his monthly wages, with $247 directed to his ongoing child-support obligation and $153 applied to the arrearage.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 27, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 3 through 8 (Item 1 is the SOR and Item 2 is a receipt). \nApplicant submitted a response to the FORM, which included documents marked as AE \nA though AA. There were no objections to the Items or AEs offered and they are admitted \ninto evidence. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied both allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He has not been married and has two adult children, \nages 24 and 25. He has been employed by his present employer since 2017. \nThe financial allegations alleged in the SOR are supported by Applicant\u2019s \nstatements in his May 2018 security clearance application (SCA), his answer to the SOR, \nhis statements made to a government investigator in May 2019, and credit bureau reports \n(CBR) from November 2021 and August 2018. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has child-support arrearages totaling \napproximately $39,884. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that the same \nchild-support arrearage currently alleged was previously adjudicated at a security \nclearance hearing in 2010, at which time the balance was $28,000. At that hearing, he \npresented evidence that he had established a payment plan to address the debt in which \n$400 would be automatically withheld from his monthly wages, with $247 directed to his \nongoing child-support obligation and $153 applied to the arrearage. The decision implies \nthat the Income Withholding Order was recently established, and Applicant had not yet \nmade any payments as of the May 2010 hearing. Since the decision, the arrearages have \ngrown to the alleged amount. (Items 6, 8) \nApplicant disclosed in his May 2018 SCA that he is paying the minimum amount \nrequired on his debt, and he is attempting to have it recalculated. He explained in his \nSOR answer that his child-support payments have been automatically withheld from his \nwages for many years, but those payments are not reflected in the balance on his credit \nreport. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided a copy of the Income \nWithholding for Support letter sent to his employer in August 2012 requesting $267 be \nwithheld for child support and $67 be withheld for past-due child support. In support of his \npayment efforts, he provided a paystub from one employer for October 2013 that reflected \na year-to-date total paid of $3,083. He provided two paystubs from a different employer \nfrom November 2013 and December 2013 that shows the year-to-date amount paid was \n$1,370. In his SOR answer, he did not provide any other documentation of payments \nsince 2010. In addition, he provided a document to show his children were enrolled in \nschool in 2013 and he was listed as the parent on their school forms. He provided the \nsame documents in his response to the FORM.

It stated that the \nstate did not add interest to Applicant\u2019s child support arrears. The amount accrued is the \nactual court-ordered amount. The email stated: \nWe have not received any payments from you since October 1, 2013 when \nthe employer at the time quit withholding. We did receive a $978.35 \npayment in June 2015 as a result of a hit on your bank account. I cannot \nnegotiate any amount as long as there is a valid court order in effect, which \nthere is until [child] emancipates in [M]ay. After that, I would be in agreement \nwith the $250 per month. I have received a notice that a check will be \ncoming in for $350 around [M]arch 21st. Thank you for setting that up. I will \ngo through your case and see what months the support may be able to be \nremoved due to you having the children. I will do an updated affidavit of \narrears and send it out to you. (AE F) \nApplicant provided receipts to show he made payments of $250 in April 2016 and \nMay 2016 and payments of $150 in February 2017, March 2017 and January 2018. The \nreceipts say they were paid by auto pay, but I am unable to determine if the auto pay \nstopped after May 2016 because the amount was reduced, indicating there was a change. \nHe did not provide proof of consecutive payments. He did not provide other evidence to \nshow payments made since his 2010 hearing, other than the 2013 payments made \nthrough his employer. (AE A through E, G, H, I) \nApplicant has repeatedly said that he made child-support payments to different \nstates that did not give him credit; that his children lived with him for years so he should \nnot have been paying child support; and that he should be given credit for air fare he paid \nfor the children. He did not provide evidence that he followed up with the case worker in \nthe state where the child-support order was issued to request an adjustment or request a \nrecalculation. If one was made, he did not provide it to show the current amount owed or \nif the balance was satisfied. He provided a \u201cchild support collections\u201d document from a \ndifferent state from May 2001, which reflected that $7,242 would be garnished from his \nwages through his employer at the time. It is unknown if this occurred or how long he \nworked for his employer. He claims he made payments from 2001 to 2009 to a different \nstate that were never deducted. However, when he had his 2010 hearing, he had a \nsubstantial amount of child support in arrears. He further stated that he has tried to correct \nthe child-support issues since 2001, but has been unable because he does not have an \nattorney in the state where the order was issued to petition the court and it is a financial \nburden to travel there. (AE K) \nApplicant provided with his response to the FORM, a state tax document from 2014 \nthat shows he received unemployment compensation during that tax year. In his 2018 \nSCA, he does not list any period of unemployment for 2014.

He \ndisclosed this debt on his 2018 SCA and noted he believed he was double-billed by his \ninsurance company for a back brace. He believes the device was covered by his \ninsurance benefits. He stated that he was in the process of having the collection account \nremoved from his CBR. In his May 2019 interview with a government investigator, he said \nthe debt should have been covered by his insurance company. The debt was incurred in \napproximately December 2014. He said the issue was between the medical supply \ncompany and his insurance company. He was waiting for them to resolve it, but he did \nnot believe he was responsible for this debt. In his response to the FORM, Applicant \nprovided numerous insurance documents. The debt is not reported on the 2018 or 2021 \nCBRs. Based on the evidence, Applicant has a legitimate dispute and has been battling \nthe insurance companies to resolve it. I find for him on his allegation. (Item 4; AE K, M \nthrough AA) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n1 I have not considered any derogatory information not alleged for disqualifying purposes, but may consider \nit when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person \nanalysis.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has known for years that his child-support obligation was in arrears. \nDespite having years to resolve it, he has not. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s child-support arrearages have existed for many years. He has \nrepeatedly made numerous claims that he has made payments; should be given credit \nwhen the children lived with him; he should be given credit for air fare he paid; and that \nhe made payments to other states that were not credited. He noted on his 2018 SCA that \nhe was having the state where the order was issued recalculate what he owed. It has \nbeen four years since that statement, and he has not provided evidence of action he has \ntaken. Applicant may have legitimate claims for why his arrearages should be reduced, \nbut he has provided insufficient evidence to me to make that determination. He needs to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolve it with the state and he has not.

There is insufficient evidence this debt was beyond his control. He has not \npresented evidence that he has acted responsibly, that there are clear indications the \ndebt is being resolved, or he made a good-faith effort to repay the arrearages. AG \u00b6 20(a) \nthrough AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant disputed the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided numerous \ndocuments to support his dispute. His 2021 and 2018 credit reports do not report this \ndebt. I find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to this debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nInsufficient evidence was provided, and Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Erica Bilkis, Esq. \n03/17/2022 \nDecision \nHOGAN, Erin, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption), and J (criminal conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 17, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On August 20, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the CAF did not find under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines G, Alcohol \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsumption and J, Criminal Conduct. On October 28, 2020, Applicant responded to \nthe SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn May 7, 2021, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. The case \nwas transferred to me on October 26, 2021. The hearing was originally scheduled for \nJanuary 11, 2022, but was delayed for health reasons. The parties agreed to a new \nhearing date of February 15, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled using Microsoft \nTeams video teleconference. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, Gov Ex 1-6 and one \nhearing exhibit, HE 1. Applicant offered five exhibits, AE A-E. There were no objections; \nand all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 12-13, 19) On \nFebruary 23, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. \nSome details in this decision were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. \nSpecific information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also \nprovided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old technical consultant working for a defense contractor. \n(Tr. 46; GE 1) His highest level of education is a Master\u2019s Degree. He is single but \ninvolved in a relationship. He lives with his mother. He is her caregiver. (Tr. 18, 41, 45) \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in about December 2018 and \ncharged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. He was stopped while driving home \nfrom a holiday party. Applicant entered a Nolle Diversion Program. In April 2019, he \nsuccessfully completed the terms of the diversion program to include three days of \ncommunity service; completing a Traffic Alcohol Program (TAP); completing a Traffic \nSafety Program and attending a Victim Impact Panel. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Tr. 27; Gov 4; Gov 5; \nGov 6 at 3) \nIn July 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol. He attended a friend\u2019s birthday party and had several drinks. He dropped off \nhis friend, and while he was driving home, he was pulled over for speeding and having \nexpired tags. The police officer smelled alcohol on his breath and gave Applicant a field \nsobriety test, which he failed. In 2013, Applicant plead guilty. He was sentenced to 30 \ndays house arrest with the exception of driving to and from work. His license was \nsuspended for one year. He paid a $2,500 fine and attended alcohol awareness classes. \n(SOR  \u00b6 1.b: Tr. 26-27; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 6 at 3).   \n \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, Applicant was arrested in January 2009 and charged with Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol. He was drinking at a bar with friends. He claims someone might \nhave put something in in his drink. The police pulled him over while he was driving home. \nHe plead guilty to DUI on September 16, 2009. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 60 \ndays, He entered a diversion program. Once he completed the diversion program the \nconviction was expunged from his records. He initially left this DUI offense off his 2018 \nsecurity clearance application. He thought he did not have to list the offense because it \nwas expunged from his record. (SOR \u00b61.c: Tr. 24-26; Gov 6 at 3-4) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant states he is very remorseful and would like to \napologize to his family, employer and government clients. They all placed trust in his \ndecision-making ability. He has complied with all of the terms and conditions of each \noffense in a timely manner. He has gained a better understanding on how to prevent a \nsimilar situation occurring in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent DUI offense in December 2018, occurred shortly after he \nsubmitted his security clearance application. He attempted to contact his Facility Security \nOfficer (FSO) the next day after his arrest. His FSO did not answer the phone so he sent \nan e-mail. (Tr. 30; Gov 4) \nAs part of his nolle diversion program for the December 2018 offense, Applicant \nsuccessfully completed a state-certified Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program on \nFebruary 5, 2019. Dr. R., Clinical Counselor for the program, indicates that Applicant \nsuccessfully completed 26 sessions of the program. Dr. R. states: \u201c[Applicant] was an \nattentive and active participant and contributed with good thoughts in group sessions. It \nappears that he had gained knowledge on the consequences of alcohol and illicit drugs \nin in his life.\u201d  (Note: The case file provides no evidence Applicant used illicit drugs nor is \nit alleged in the SOR.) (Tr. 28; AE B-1) \nApplicant was required to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Victim \nImpact Panel. He testified that the panelists spoke about how alcohol-related incidents \nnegatively affected their lives. He could relate because his father was killed when he was \nyounger. The panel changed his perspective and made him understand how drinking and \ndriving can negatively impact others. (Tr. 28-30; AE B-2) Applicant completed 24 hours \nof community service. (Tr. 28-30; AE B-3)   \nApplicant completed the requirements of his diversion program in 2019. (AE C) \nHe was not diagnosed with an alcohol or substance abuse disorder. He was not advised \nto stop drinking alcohol. He occasionally drinks once or twice a week. He meets friends \nto watch sports or attend work-related network events. He testified that he has worked to \nchange his behavior. He monitors his alcohol consumption and makes sure that he does \nnot drink and drive. He arranges to take an Uber or Lyft when he plans on drinking. (Tr. \n30-32) \nSince October 2021, Applicant has met with a therapist every two to three weeks \nto seek help with setting better boundaries and self-care, and seeking healthier ways to \nrelieve stress. His therapist\u2019s credentials include PhD, LICSW, and LCSW-C.

[Applicant] fully engages in the therapeutic process \nand consistently demonstrates commitment to his mental and emotional well-being.\u201d (Tr. \n32-33; AE E)  \nApplicant has begun to exercise more and has learned to meditate. He does not \nstruggle with controlling his alcohol intake. He has not had an alcohol-related incident \nsince his December 2018 arrest. (Tr. 33) \nCharacter Evidence \nMr. K.W., a friend and co-worker of Applicant, testified on his behalf. He has known \nApplicant for four years. He describes Applicant as a mentor who encouraged him to \napply for a job at his current place of employment. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s three DUIs. \nApplicant told him about the 2018 DUI the morning after it happened. He testified \nApplicant was very remorseful and knew he made a mistake. He observed Applicant \nbeing proactive in preventing future alcohol-related incidents. Applicant tells all of his \nfriends of the importance of not drinking and driving. K.W. socializes with Applicant. When \nApplicant drinks he usually only has one to two drinks, mainly beer. He believes Applicant \ndrinks responsibly. He states that it is unlikely Applicant will drink and drive in the future. \nApplicant has grown over the years. Applicant has a stellar reputation at work. Applicant \nis his mother\u2019s caregiver. Applicant and his friends now focus on healthier activities, such \nas biking. They are starting a bike club. (Tr. 13-19) \nMr. C.D. is vice president of a school that provides alternative education paths for \ncustomers receiving government assistance. He has known Applicant for over 13 years \nboth professionally and personally. In 2019, Applicant began teaching a course pro bono. \nApplicant prepared the lessons, provided one-on-one feedback, and successfully guided \nan 85% pass rate for his students. After each program, the students provide feedback on \nthe instructors. Applicant receives extremely high marks. He communicates comfortably \nwith his students. He shares some of the barriers he faced and the students look to him \nas an example of what they can become if they focus on their goals. Mr. C.D. trusts \nApplicant and feels lucky that Applicant is willing to teach without receiving pay. He notes \nApplicant faced his barriers and miscalculation of judgment directly. Applicant took \nresponsibility and shares a wealth of knowledge with the students and anyone else who \nneeds assistance. (AE B \u2013 5; RSP003) \nApplicant provided employer feedback of his duty performance from 2019 to 2021. \nApplicant has an excellent reputation at work and is highly regarded by his supervisors \nand customers. (AE D) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 states the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) apply. Between 2009 and 2018, Applicant had three DUI \narrests. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents away from \nwork. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies because the evidence supports that Applicant consumed alcohol \nto the point of impaired judgement before each of his alcohol-related arrests. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nI have carefully considered history of alcohol-related DUIs. I considered that \nApplicant reduced his alcohol consumption after his 2018 DWI. He successfully \ncompleted the court-ordered Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program. He did not receive a \ndiagnosis or recommendation to cease his alcohol consumption. Dr. R., the Clinical \nCounselor, noted Applicant was an attentive and active participant in the program. \nApplicant also learned from attending the MADD Victim Impact Panel. He currently drinks \nalcohol at a responsible level and limits his alcohol consumption to two drinks when he \ndrinks. He insures that he does not drink and drive by taking Lyft or Uber on occasions \nwhen he is drinking. He has had no subsequent alcohol-related incidents involving the \npolice and courts after December 2018. Enough time has elapsed without alcohol-related \nproblems to enable a reasonable predictive judgment that his maladaptive use of alcohol \nis safely in the past. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. Applicant acknowledged his issues with alcohol \nand has taken steps to reduce his consumption and avoid drinking and driving. In October \n2021, Applicant started and continues to see a therapist every two to three weeks to assist \nhim with setting better boundaries, improving self-care, and finding better ways to relieve \nstress. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s past history of alcohol consumption does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Alcohol consumption security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant committed DUI offenses in 2009, 2012 and 2018. These misdemeanor-\nlevel offenses are serious in that they entailed a risk of death, bodily injury, and property \ndamage to Applicant and other drivers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant demonstrated he is actively taking steps to prevent another alcohol-\nrelated driving offense. While he drinks on occasion, he limits himself to one to two drinks. \nHe takes an Uber or Lyft on occasions when he does drink. He actively participated during \nthe alcohol class he was required to take after his 2018 DUI. He has not been involved in \nan alcohol-related offense since December 2018. He is rated favorably by his employer \nand his customers. AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. Applicant mitigated the Criminal \nConduct concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old technical consultant working for a defense contractor. \nHis work colleagues think highly of him. Applicant teaches a pro bono class to adults from \nunder- privileged backgrounds in his spare time. He is a full-time caregiver to his mother. \nHis friends are supportive. He immediately disclosed his 2018 DUI to his FSO and has \nbeen fully cooperative throughout his background investigation. He completed all of the \nterms for each of his DUI offenses. His clinical counselor indicated he was an active \nparticipant in his alcohol counseling program. He reduced his alcohol use and takes steps \nto avoid drinking and driving by using Uber or Lyft on occasions when he intends to drink \nalcohol. I am further impressed by Applicant\u2019s decision to see a therapist on a regular \nbasis to assist him with setting boundaries and seeking healthier ways to deal with stress. \nApplicant is aware of the consequences should he become involved in an alcohol-related \nincident in the future. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated the \nalcohol consumption, and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nErin C. Hogan \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Tr. at 16-17, 26-28, 31-32, 35-36) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s has a history of financial problems, including several delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment; underemployment; \nhis girlfriend being out of work because of the COVID pandemic; the father of his \ngirlfriend\u2019s child failing to pay child support; and his uncle accepting funds for a home \nremodeling, but not completing the work, leaving Applicant to pay some of the money \nback to the homeowner. Applicant\u2019s work history includes several terminations, which \nhe described as primarily for events that were not his fault. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were at least partially beyond his control. \nApplicant has worked for his current employer since December 2018. At most, I \ncan credit him with three $75 payments, which occurred since August 2021, after he \nwas sued and after the issuance of the SOR. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant disputed owing the $332 charged-off department store credit card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), and it is not listed on the December 2020 and August 2021 credit reports, \nbut both credit reports are beyond the seven-year reporting window. The comment on \nthe 2019 credit report: \u201cConsumer disputes after resolution\u201d appears to indicate that \nApplicant was unsuccessful in disputing the debt before it aged off his credit report. I am \ncrediting him with mitigating the debt because once a debt falls off a credit report, there \nis little an applicant can do to further dispute the debt. \nApplicant asserted that his finances are in better shape; he lives within his \nmeans; and he intends to pay his debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant is a 34-year-old mechanical engineer employed by a defense contractor since July 2008. He has held an industrial clearance since approximately June 2009, based on an April 2009 clearance application (Item 4). In May 2008, he graduated from a prestigious U.S. university with a degree in mechanical engineering. He married in June 2015 (Item 5); he and his wife adopted a shelter dog in mid-2017, and had a daughter in May 2019 (Item 3). Applicant disclosed no substance abuse on his April 2009 clearance application (Item 4). On his March 2019 clearance application (Item 5), he stated that he used marijuana about once or twice per year from about September 2004 to July 2018, on special occasions. He also stated his intent to continue to use marijuana in the future, as its use was legal in his state of residence and he could not categorically foreswear future use. He reiterated this drug history and intent during a June 2019 interview with a Government investigator, stating that he enjoyed marijuana and it did not affect his work.

However, he also noted that he had used \nmarijuana with his wife (without clarifying whether they were married at the time). He has \nalso drastically edited the extent of his drug use, stating that he did not really remember \nthe number of occasions he used marijuana, and gave the September 2004 start date to \ncoincide with his entry to college out of an abundance of caution (Answer, Item 3). \nHowever, he currently counts only two specific instances of drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer includes a November 2020 drug screen with negative results, \nemployment evaluations and awards attesting to an otherwise exemplary work history \nfrom 2008 to 2019, and a November 2020 statement of intent abjuring future drug use \nconsistent with the directive\u2014along with a commitment to regular drug screens for at least \nthe next two years (Item 3). \nAside from his employment evaluations and company awards, Applicant submitted \nno work or character references, and provided no evidence of any community \ninvolvement. Applicant\u2019s Answer contains many self-serving assertions that require me \nto accept his inferences that (1) he was unaware of Federal law proscribing marijuana \nuse, regardless of state law, that (2) he was oblivious to the obvious proscription implied \nby the drug abuse question on the clearance application, that (3) he was unaware of any \ncompany policy regarding drug use, and that (4) despite his meticulous answers to \ndetailed questions on his clearance applications, and the precision required by his \nemployment and his profession, he was unable to more precisely pinpoint the extent of \nhis drug use on his 2019 clearance application and during his 2019 subject interview. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must \nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00a7 \n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. \nHowever, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be measured against \nthem, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a clearance. \nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative \nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by \ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse between at least June 2009, when his \nclearance was granted, and July 2018, and his previously-stated intent to continue his \nuse. Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns.3 Applicant used marijuana for as \nmany as nine years, and did so while having access to classified information. His use was \nillegal under Federal law at all times. Applicant only stated an unequivocal intent to cease \nhis marijuana use, despite his knowledge of its illegality under Federal law, and its \ninconsistency with access to classified information, after he received the SOR. \nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give little support to Applicant. His illegal \ndrug abuse was recent, regular, and apparently frequent, and the facts do not support \ncircumstances unlikely to recur. 4 The record contains no evidence to document a \n2See, Department of the Navy v.

The case was assigned to me on February 28, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about June 2016 to about March 2019, and that he purchased marijuana \nfrom early 2017 to about March 2019. In Applicant\u2019s September 2021 answer to the SOR, \nhe admitted both SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant is 22 years old. He graduated from high school in June 2018 and started \ncollege in September 2018. He lived in campus housing from September 2018 to at least \nJune 2019, and reported that he was seeking a degree. He has not been married and has \nno children. He started an internship for a federal contractor in May 2019. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2019. He \ndisclosed that he used marijuana from June 2016 to March 2019. He stated that he \nsmoked marijuana once or twice a week to relieve stress, and that he did not know how \nmany times he had used marijuana. He reported that he enjoyed using marijuana, but did \nnot intend to use it in the future to avoid risking employment opportunities. He noted that \nif the recreational use of marijuana were legalized, that he intended to use marijuana \nagain. He denied being involved in the illegal purchase of marijuana. (Item 3)  \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2019. He verified \nthe accuracy of his SCA responses, and clarified that if marijuana use were legalized \nunder Federal law he would resume using it because that would not jeopardize his \nemployment opportunities. He stated that he smoked marijuana approximately once \nevery three months from June 2016 until September 2018. He said that after he started \ncollege in September 2018, he smoked approximately one gram of marijuana that was \nshared with one-two friends on each occasion, one-two times per week. He smoked the \nmarijuana at a friend\u2019s home, off campus residences, parks, or in the woods or forests. \nHe identified nine people that he had smoked marijuana with including long-term friends \nidentified as references in his SCA, and one roommate. He said that he smoked marijuana \nfor experimentation, social purposes, and as a means to relax. He believed that marijuana \nwas a better option for relaxation than alcohol. He said that he continued to socialize with \nindividuals who use drugs illegally. He noted that his parents, brother, former girlfriends \nand the nine individuals he identified were aware of his marijuana use, and believed that \nsince his marijuana use was known that it could not be used for blackmail or coercion. He \nstated that the marijuana was obtained by friends and shared among the group, and that \nhe had purchased marijuana for use by the group. He noted that he had failed to disclose \nthat he had purchased marijuana on his SCA and attributed that failure to an unintentional \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noversight. He reported that he first purchased marijuana in early 2017 and had most \nrecently purchased marijuana in March 2019. He said that he purchased approximately \n3.5 grams of marijuana twice a month, for an unspecified period of time, from a friend. He \nsaid that he understands rules and regulations are in place for a reason, and follows them \nto the best of his ability. He has not sought counseling or treatment for his marijuana use. \n(Items 3, 4) \nApplicant did not provide documents or evidence in response to the SOR, and did \nnot submit a response to the FORM. (Item 1) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and \nnon-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental \nimpairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such \nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 \nU.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana between June 2016 and March 2019, \nand that he purchased marijuana from early 2017 to about March 2019. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nIn his May 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed that from approximately June 2016 to \nMarch 2019, he smoked marijuana one-two times weekly to relieve stress. He noted that \nhe enjoyed using marijuana, but did not intend to use it in the future because that could \nnegatively impact his employment opportunities. He also noted that if the recreational use \nof marijuana were legalized, that he intended to use it again. He denied being involved in \nthe illegal purchase of marijuana. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 2019 background interview he verified the accuracy of his \nSCA responses and provided the following additional information. He said that he would \nresume using marijuana if legalized under Federal law because that would not jeopardize \nhis employment opportunities. He smoked marijuana approximately once every three \nmonths from June 2016 until September 2018, and increased his usage to one-two times \nweekly once college started in September 2018 until March 2019. He smoked \napproximately one gram of marijuana on each occasion that he shared with one-two \nfriends. He identified nine individuals that he had smoked marijuana with including long-\nterm friends and one roommate. He believed that marijuana is a better option for \nrelaxation than alcohol. He continued to socialize with individuals who use drugs illegally. \nHe said that his parents, brother, former girlfriends, and the nine individuals that he had \nused marijuana with were aware of his marijuana use. He stated that the marijuana was \nobtained by friends and shared among the group, and that he had purchased marijuana \nfor use by the group. He attributed his failure to disclose that he had purchased marijuana \non his SCA to an unintentional oversight. He first purchased marijuana in early 2017 and \nmost recently purchased marijuana in March 2019. He said that he purchased \napproximately seven grams of marijuana a month, for an unspecified period of time, from \na friend that he also has smoked marijuana with. He had not sought counseling or \ntreatment for his marijuana use.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe only additional relevant information Applicant has provided since his June \n2019 background interview was his September 2021 answer to the SOR in which he \nadmitted, without further explanation or documentary evidence, that he had committed \nthe conduct alleged. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant smoked marijuana from June 2016 until \nMarch 2019 with friends. His May and June 2019 statements that he abstained from \nsmoking marijuana from March 2019 to June 2019 and did not intend to illegally smoke \nmarijuana in the future are insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely when \nconsidered in conjunction with his admitted preference for marijuana as a means to relax \nand intent to use marijuana in the future (if legal under Federal law), monthly purchases \nof approximately seven grams of marijuana over an unspecified period of time, and \ncontinued association with individuals who illegally use drugs. The record is somewhat \nambiguous as to the frequency of his marijuana use, how much marijuana he used and \nwho provided that marijuana. This limited record, including the absence of information or \nevidence regarding Applicant and his drug involvement or lack thereof since June 2019, \nis insufficient to support a conclusion that the security concerning behavior is unlikely to \nrecur and casts doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies. Applicant acknowledged his drug involvement from \nJune 2016 to March 2019, claimed that he did not purchase or use marijuana from March \nto June 2019, and stated his intent to abstain from the illegal use of marijuana in May and \nJune 2019. However, AG \u00b6 26(b) does not fully apply because Applicant has not provided \nevidence of actions taken to overcome his drug involvement and he has not established \na pattern of abstinence. He has provided no documentary evidence, and since June 2019, \nno information pertaining to actions taken to overcome his drug involvement or to \nestablish a pattern of abstinence. His disclosures of his drug abuse do lend some \ncredibility to his concurrent statements of intent to refrain from illegal drug abuse. \nHowever, when considered in conjunction with awareness of his marijuana use among \nindividuals likely to be interviewed by investigators at the time he made the disclosures, \nhis continued association with individuals who illegally use marijuana, and in the absence \nof evidence that he has changed or avoided environments where marijuana is used, I find \nhis unsigned statements of intent insufficient to establish a pattern of abstinence. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his marijuana purchases on his SCA was not alleged \nin the SOR. I find that Applicant unintentionally failed to disclose this illegal drug \ninvolvement on his SCA. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is now 22 years old and that he was 16 to 19 years old \nduring the time period of his admitted drug involvement. While any illegal drug \ninvolvement is not condoned, Applicant's youth is an extenuating factor. His candor about \nhis drug abuse in his SCA and during a background interview provide indications of \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness to comply with rules, and also lend some \ncredibility to his May and June 2019 statements of intent to refrain from illegal drug abuse. \nHowever, for the reasons discussed above, I do not find his disclosures and statements \nof intent to abstain from the illegal use of marijuana dispositive. He has provided no \ndocumentary evidence and did not to respond to the FORM with relevant and material \nfacts about his circumstances, which may have helped to rebut, extenuate, mitigate, or \nexplain the security concern. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means \nthat the record discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing \nISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, EO 10865, and the Directive \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to meet \nhis burden of persuasion and the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Id.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges and Applicant admitted that he fell behind on his mortgage \npayments between January and October 2014 due to his gambling habits. (SOR \nresponse; GE 1 at 43) Starting in January 2014, he was gambling twice a week, and each \ntime he spent several hundred dollars.

(GE 1 at 43; GE 2 at 8) He called a hotline for treatment of gambling \naddiction several times, and he has not gambled since 2014. (Tr. 37) According to his \nJune 2, 2014 three bureau credit report, his mortgage balance was $214,504; it was \npreviously 180 days past due; and it was currently in pays as agreed status. (GE 14 at 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s allege and Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file \nhis federal and state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2013, 2014, and 2015. (SOR \nresponse) At the time the SOR was issued, he owed federal income taxes for TYs 2013, \n2014, and 2015. (Id.) However, during his March 15, 2019, Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) interview, he said: (1) he had filed his tax returns for TYs 2013, 2014, \nand 2015 in 2017; (2) he paid the taxes for TYs 2014 and 2015; and (3) he owed $4,500 \nfor TY 2013.

(Tr. 42-43) Most of the delinquent taxes were paid in 2019, and the \nremainder of his taxes were paid in 2020. (Tr. 43-44) He said he filed all tax returns and \npaid all delinquent taxes. (Tr. 37) \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.o that he has 14 delinquent debts \ntotaling $37,768. At his hearing, he said in late 2020 or early 2021, he refinanced his \nhouse and received about $100,000. (Tr. 42, 45) After his hearing, he said the refinancing \nwas in June 2020. (AE D) He said the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f through 1.i, 1.n, and 1.o \nwere paid prior to refinancing his mortgage, and the remainder were paid after he \nrefinanced his mortgage. (AE D) He said he had to pay his delinquent debts in order to \nreceive the funds from the mortgage company. (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s August 10, 2021 Equifax credit report indicates he has a $515,871 \nmortgage account opened March 3, 2021, with a scheduled monthly payment of $2,099, \nand this mortgage is in \u201cpays as agreed\u201d status. (GE 16 at 3) He said that most of the \n$100,000 was used to remodel the kitchen of his residence. (Tr. 42) He used some of the \nremainder to pay all of the SOR debts. (Tr. 38) His August 10, 2021 Equifax credit report \nshows the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b as a charged-off credit union account with first delinquency \nin July 2017 for $15,552 with an actual payment of $15,552, a charged-off amount of \n$15,552, and a zero balance.

(Tr. 23; GE 4) Some of the soldiers sexually \nassaulted her while she was unconscious. (GE 4) Applicant denied his involvement in his \nfirst statement to the CID. (Tr. 23; GE 4) Applicant subsequently provided a statement \nadmitting his role in the sexual conduct. (Tr. 23-24; GE 4) He asserted that the woman \nconsented to his sexual contacts. (GE 2 at 5-6) Applicant\u2019s offenses were resolved under \nArticle 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (Tr. 22) At his hearing, he said he \ndid not remember the offenses on his Article 15. (Tr. 23) His nonjudicial punishment (NJP) \nincluded 45 days of extra duty and 45 days of restriction.

(Tr. 24; \nSOR response) He said his spouse was heavily involved with cocaine, and he \u201cgot caught \nup in it.\u201d (Tr. 40) However, he said he only used cocaine once, and he was caught on the \nurinalysis test. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2 at 6-7) He denied that he used any illegal drugs in the \nprevious 10 years. (Tr. 42) He received 45 days of extra duty, 45 days of restriction, and \nreduction from specialist (E-4) to private (E-2) at an NJP proceeding held under Article \n15, UCMJ.

(Tr. 36) She currently takes Suboxone in lieu of heroin. \n(Tr. 36) Applicant advised the OPM investigator that his spouse failed a random urinalysis \nand lost her employment; however, he did not indicate the particular drug she was \naccused of using or the date when she lost her employment. (GE 2 at 12) He said his \npurchases of heroin were not common knowledge among his family members or friends \n\u201cas it is a very personal matter.\u201d (Id. at 13) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i and 2.j allege and Applicant admitted he was arrested in August 2014 \nand October 2014, and charged with not using an ignition-interlock device on his vehicle \nin violation of his probation resulting from the DUI conviction in SOR \u00b6 2.f. (Tr. 30; SOR \nresponse) Applicant said he drove to work without the interlock device because he \nneeded to get to work to earn money to pay for the interlock device.

(Id.) He \nneeded no supervision, had good potential for rehabilitation, and made important \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. (Id.) Several of their statements recommended \nhis retention in the Army. (Id.) \nApplicant said he has learned from his mistakes. (Tr. 39) He is a better person \nnow. (Tr. 39) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \ninformation.

Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; and \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(f), \nand 19(h) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe relevant financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 in this \ncase are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his first spouse, his second spouse\u2019s drug addiction, and \nhis second spouse\u2019s unemployment caused financial problems, and such circumstances, \nwere largely beyond his control. He does not receive full credit for these circumstances \nbecause his DUI, gambling, and heroin purchases were not beyond his control, and they \ncontributed to his financial problems. Moreover, he did not prove he acted reasonably \nunder the circumstances because he did not provide evidence of maintenance of contact \nwith his creditors and that he established payment plans whenever possible. \nIn 2014, Applicant fell behind 180 days on his mortgage due to gambling and \nexpenses from purchasing heroin for his wife. However, in 2014, he ended his gambling, \nand his spouse received inpatient drug rehabilitation and is not currently using heroin. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.p (delinquent mortgage in 2014) is mitigated because it \nis not recent. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he filed his tax returns for TYs 2013, 2014, and 2015 \nin 2018 or 2019. Most of the delinquent taxes were paid in 2019, and the remainder of his \ntax debt was paid in 2020. He filed his tax returns and paid his delinquent federal and \nstate income tax debts before the SOR was issued on April 23, 2021. He is credited with \nmitigation of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.o that Applicant owes 14 delinquent \ndebts totaling $37,768. In late 2020 or early 2021, he refinanced his house and received \nabout $100,000. Most of the $100,000 was used to remodel the kitchen of his residence. \nHe used some of the remainder to pay any SOR debts not previously paid. I have credited \nApplicant with paying all of his SOR debts using part of the $100,000 he recently borrowed \nwhen he refinanced his mortgage. \nThe Appeal Board addressed the scenario where an applicant used a debt \nconsolidation loan to pay his delinquent SOR debts as follows: \nWhen viewed from a macro perspective, the mitigative value of Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to resolve his financial problems remains uncertain. He obtained a \ndebt-consolidation loan to pay three of the four alleged debts. In effect, he \nsubstituted one form of indebtedness (credit card debt) for another form (a \ndebt-consolidation loan) or, looking at it in a different way, he converted old \ndebt into new debt. He did not provide documentation setting forth the \ndetails of the debt-consolidation loan or show that he has made any \npayments toward this new loan. The evidence he presented fails to \ndemonstrate that his financial situation has improved, fails to establish any \nmeaningful track record of payments to reduce the indebtedness at issue, \nand fails to show that his financial problems are under control. In short, he \nhas failed to prove his total indebtedness has been resolved in any \nsignificant manner. While we recognize that a debt-consolidation loan may \nbe beneficial to an applicant in certain circumstances, we are unable to \ndiscern, based on the facts in this case, how merely substituting one form \nof debt for another, without more, reduces the security concerns arising \nfrom the alleged debts. As Department Counsel argues, Applicant\u2019s \nmitigation efforts amount to a promise to pay the indebtedness in the future, \nwhich is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner \nor otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. \nISCR Case No. 20-01510 at 3-4 (App. Bd. July 14, 2021) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and citing ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2015)). \n\u201c[A]n applicant does not have to have paid off all of his debts in order to mitigate \nGuideline F concerns.

Under the DOHA Appeal \nBoard jurisprudence, his resolution of his delinquent SOR debts is too little, too late to \nmitigate security concerns. He did not prove that he had circumstances warranting his \ninordinate delay in paying his delinquent SOR debts. He did not establish that he was \nunable to make greater progress sooner paying his debts. I am not confident that he will \nbe able to keep his new mortgage current, or that he will be unable to avoid new consumer \ndelinquent debt. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) provide: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes but \nis not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e). requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. Discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that are relevant to this \ncase are as follows: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual abuse of an intoxicated woman in 1999 and his cocaine use in \n2004 are not recent. He has not engaged in subsequent sexual misconduct, and there is \nno evidence that he has used illegal drugs after 2004. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d are \nmitigated. His timecard abuse in 2013 and unacceptable attendance in 2014 are minor \nand not recent. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.k are mitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s DUI in 2014 is serious misconduct. He was cited twice for probation \nviolations in 2014 by driving without an alcohol interlock device. However, these offenses \noccurred more than seven years ago, are not recent, and have not recurred. There is no \nevidence of alcohol abuse in the previous 10 years. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, 2.i, 2.j, and 2.l are \nmitigated. \nIn 2014, Applicant purchased heroin and distributed it to his wife multiple times a \nweek over a four-month period. At his hearing, he said his heroin distribution offenses \noccurred on only about nine or ten occasions. Applicant was minimizing his heroin \ninvolvement at his hearing by understating the amount of heroin distribution offenses. \nHeroin is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug Enforcement Administration \nwebsite, https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling. Heroin distribution is \nserious misconduct. His distribution of heroin risked his spouse\u2019s life because the heroin \ncould have been contaminated. There is no evidence his employer, law enforcement, or \ncommunity are aware of his involvement with heroin. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.h are not \nmitigated. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old aviation maintenance technician, and he has worked for \na government contractor for 13 years. In 2007, he was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in \ncomputer science. He served in the Army from 1996 to 1999 and from 2001 to 2005. He \nwas a private E-2 when he was discharged in 2005 with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. \nApplicant served in an imminent danger pay area in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Kuwait and Iraq from April 14, 2003, to April 13, 2004. He received the \nfollowing awards: ARCOM; NDSM; GWTEM; GWTSM; ASR; ARGCM; and OSB (2nd \nAward). \nIn January 2005, two officers and four noncommissioned officers provided positive \ndescriptions of Applicant\u2019s duty performance and potential for future service. A general \nsense of their portrayals is that Applicant was an outstanding soldier and excellent worker \nwho showed initiative and was diligent, responsible, professional, and intelligent. He \nneeded no supervision, had good potential for rehabilitation, and made important \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. Several of their statements recommended his \nretention in the Army. Applicant said he has learned from his mistakes, and he is a better \nperson now. \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is \nmore persuasive. He incurred more delinquent debt after his nonpriority and unsecured \ndebts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 2009. He refinanced \nhis mortgage in 2020 and used some of the proceeds to pay his delinquent SOR debts. \nHowever, he spent most of the funds from refinancing his home to remodel his kitchen \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ninstead of saving the funds for potential emergencies or borrowing less money. He used \nnew debt to pay old debt, and the amount of the new debt is significantly more than the \nold debt. He has a long history of delinquent debts. There is a lingering concern that he \nwill have additional delinquent debts in the future. Applicant purchased heroin and \ndistributed it to his wife on numerous occasions in 2014. I find his statement on his SCA \nto be the most credible description of his heroin involvement, and I conclude that he \nminimized the number of his heroin distributions at his hearing. There is no evidence that \nhis employer and community are aware of his history of heroin purchase and distribution. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is \nnot warranted at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p through 1.s: \nFor Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.g and 2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.i through 2.l: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

Applicant is a 55-year-old graphic designer employed by a federal contractor since September 2015. He has been employed by federal contractors since February 2006. He was cleared for a position of public trust in May 2007 after disclosing delinquent debts in a previous SCA. (FORM Item 5.) He has been married since January 1986 and has four adult children. One of his daughters and her husband lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and moved in with Applicant and his wife from June 2020 to August 2021, which increased Applicant\u2019s living expenses. Applicant disclosed two delinquent debts in his SCA: an unresolved dental bill for $1,459 from May 2014 and an unresolved car-repair bill for $7,000 in September 2015. (FORM Item 3 at 29-30.) The creditor for the car-repair bill obtained a judgment against him, which was satisfied in September 2019. (AX F.) The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $108,933.

(FORM Item 4.) The PSI summaries were \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed \nApplicant that he was entitled to submit \u201ca documentary response setting forth objections, \nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate.\u201d However, she did not \nspecifically inform Applicant that FORM Item 4 was not authenticated as required by the \nDirective, that he was entitled to object to the lack of authentication, and that the FORM \nItem 4 would not be considered if he objected. Although Applicant submitted a detailed \nresponse to the FORM, he did not object to consideration of the PSI. I conclude that \nApplicant did not knowingly and intelligently waive the authentication requirement. I have \nconsidered the fact that Applicant was interviewed about his delinquent debts, but I have \nnot considered the substance of his responses during those interviews. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with explanations \nfor the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old graphic designer employed by a federal contractor since \nSeptember 2015. He has been employed by federal contractors since February 2006. He \nwas cleared for a position of public trust in May 2007 after disclosing delinquent debts in \na previous SCA. (FORM Item 5.) He has been married since January 1986 and has four \nadult children. One of his daughters and her husband lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and \nmoved in with Applicant and his wife from June 2020 to August 2021, which increased \nApplicant\u2019s living expenses. \nApplicant disclosed two delinquent debts in his SCA: an unresolved dental bill for \n$1,459 from May 2014 and an unresolved car-repair bill for $7,000 in September 2015. \n(FORM Item 3 at 29-30.) The creditor for the car-repair bill obtained a judgment against \nhim, which was satisfied in September 2019. (AX F.) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $108,933. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from December 2021, March 2020, and April 2017. (FORM \nItems 6, 7, and 8.) \nOn April 9, 2019, Applicant hired a law firm to assist him in resolving his debts.

He has paid the law firm $285 per month for two years and has \nnow increased his payments to $355 per month for the next three and a half years. His \nestimated completion date is now in 2025. (AX A at 5) The delinquent student loans \nalleged in the SOR are not included in the law firm\u2019s program. The evidence concerning \nthe debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e: delinquent student loans totaling about $91,107. The March \n2020 credit report reflected that the student loans were delinquent and had been assigned \nto the government in 2017. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and \nEconomic Security Act (CARES Act) became law, and it provided for relief measures on \nDepartment of Education (DoEd)-owned federal student loans through September 30, \n2020. In August 2020, Applicant signed an agreement to participate in a loan rehabilitation \nprogram for these loans. In his application for the rehabilitation program, he reported that \nhis monthly income was about $10,000 per month and his monthly expenses, including \n$570 in federal student loan payments, totaled about $9,470. He agreed to pay $133 per \nmonth for nine months beginning in August 2020. (AX B.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s cover letter to the FORM response, he declared his intention to begin \nmaking payments in January 2022, when the CARES Act deferment was scheduled to \nend. On December 22, 2021, the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended \non DoEd-owned federal student loans through May 1, 2022. Applicant\u2019s student loans \nhave been in forbearance since March 27, 2020. Notwithstanding the forbearance, his \nstudent loans were delinquent well before the forbearance went into effect. He has not \nyet completed a loan rehabilitation program. I am not convinced that he will make the \nrequired payments on his student loans when they are no longer in forbearance. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: consumer debt placed for collection of $6,185. This debt was \ncharged off in March 2017. In November 2021, Applicant settled this debt for $2,918. (AX \nA at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: consumer debt charged off for $5,687.

This debt was charged off in October \n2018. In Applicant\u2019s answer, he stated that this debt was incurred when he cosigned an \nauto loan for his son. He promised to resolve it by the end of 2020. A payment was made \nin June 2021. (FORM Item 6 at 6.) A statement from his law firm reflects that the debt \nwas settled, but it does not reflect that the agreed amount has been paid. (AX A at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: auto loan charged off for $2,554.

(AX F at 3.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he submitted evidence regarding another \nauto loan on which two payments were late. This debt is not alleged in the SOR. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant encountered several conditions largely \nbeyond his control. He cosigned an auto loan for his son, but his son, now an adult, has \nnot fulfilled his legal obligation to pay all or part of the loan. One of Applicant\u2019s automobiles \nwas totaled in an accident, but his insurance did not cover all his financial loss. He \npurchased a new automobile in 2019 that turned out to be a \u201clemon,\u201d and he incurred \nabout $5,090 in expenses not covered by the vehicle warranty. His daughter and her \nhusband lost their jobs in June 2020 and moved in with Applicant and his wife, adding to \nthe household expenses. However, all these situations occurred after the student loans \nand consumer debts were already delinquent.  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s law firm negotiates and settles debts, \nbut it does not provide the financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established.

ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputed the amount his insurance \ncompany paid him for the auto which was the collateral for the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, \nbut he has not disputed the loan. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has worked for federal contractors for many years and has \nheld a public trust position since May 2007. However, he has a long history of delinquent \ndebts that predates his eligibility for a public trust position. He has offered very limited \nevidence about his overall income and expenses. He has not persuasively explained why \nso many debts became delinquent in 2017 and 2018, while he was gainfully employed. \nHe has not explained why he did not begin to address his financial problems until April \n2019, when he hired the law firm to assist him. He did not take action to address the \ndelinquent student loans until August 2020. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to \nquestion him about his apparent lack of attention to his financial obligations. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003).

Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since 2018 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he consumes intoxicants to excess. 1.a. Applicant admitted that he has consumed alcohol in excess and to the point of intoxication from about age 21 to at least April 2019. In written responses to interrogatories propounded to him by DOHA, Applicant stated that he last had an alcohol- related blackout in December 2017. He also admitted that he was last intoxicated in December 2019. Applicant further stated that he had stopped drinking for health reasons. (Item 3, Item 4.) 2 1.b. Applicant admitted he had been arrested in or about March 2009 and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), No Driver\u2019s License in Possession, DUI with BAC .08% or More, Speed in a Posted Zone, and No Display of Registration. Applicant failed to appear in court and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued on April 12, 2010. This warrant remains active. (Item 5.)

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on an unknown date, with \nexplanations, and requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n(Item 1.) In his Answer he admitted allegations 1.a through 1.e in the SOR without \nreservation. He admitted allegation 1.f, with reservations. Applicant neither admitted or \ndenied allegation 2.a. His silence is viewed as a denial of the allegation. Applicant denied \nallegations 3.a and 3.b. On December 21, 2020, and March 1, 2021, Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Department\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on \nApril 6, 2021. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. He has an associate\u2019s degree. Applicant \nhas been employed by a defense contractor since 2018 and seeks to obtain national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at \nSections 12, 13A, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he consumes intoxicants to excess. \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he has consumed alcohol in excess and to the point \nof intoxication from about age 21 to at least April 2019. In written responses to \ninterrogatories propounded to him by DOHA, Applicant stated that he last had an alcohol-\nrelated blackout in December 2017. He also admitted that he was last intoxicated in \nDecember 2019. Applicant further stated that he had stopped drinking for health reasons. \n(Item 3, Item 4.) \n2 \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted he had been arrested in or about March 2009 and charged \nwith Driving Under the Influence (DUI), No Driver\u2019s License in Possession, DUI with BAC \n.08% or More, Speed in a Posted Zone, and No Display of Registration.

Applicant \ndid admit under further questioning that he was told about the warrant during his 2010 \ninterview. Applicant stated he would talk to his current lawyer, who represented Applicant \nin relation to allegation 1.f, about the warrant. There is no information showing Applicant \nhas done anything further about this case. (Item 3.) \n1.c. Applicant was arrested by military police officers in March 2010 while he was \nserving in the Marine Corps. At that time Applicant was intoxicated and became \nbelligerent and physical with the officers. According to Applicant, he did not receive any \njudicial or non-judicial punishment due to this incident. (Item 3, Item 7,) \n1.d. Applicant was involved in an alcohol-related incident in May 2010, while still \non active duty with the Marine Corps. Applicant was drinking alcohol in the barracks with \nanother Marine, who was under the drinking age. They both became intoxicated and \ndamaged Applicant\u2019s barracks room. Applicant may have received non-judicial \npunishment for this incident, but the record is unclear. (Item 3, Item 4.) \n1.e. Subsequent to the incident in May 2010, Applicant received some form of \nalcohol counseling. The Report of Investigation (ROI) of the 2010 interview stated: \n[Applicant] stated that he was sent to the Substance Abuse Counseling \nCenter (SACC) on [Base One] for a two-day evaluation which concluded he \nhad alcohol abuse or dependence issues ([Applicant] was not sure of the \ndiagnosis). [Applicant] said that the SACC referred him to their alcohol \nrehabilitation program. [Applicant] reported that he saw a counselor four or \nfive times, but left [Base One] and transferred to [Base Two] prior to \ncompleting the full rehabilitation program. (Item 4) \nAt the time of this interview in 2010 Applicant had applied to resume the program \nat Base Two, but had not been accepted. No further information was available in the file \nor provided by Applicant. \n3 \n \n1.f. Applicant was arrested in January 2019 and charged with DUI. He stated in his \nAnswer \u201cthat case has been cleared and dismissed with prejudice.\u201d This dismissal was \nbased on a legal technicality. Applicant does not dispute the underlying fact that he was \ndriving under the influence when he was arrested.

Applicant did not admit or deny this allegation, \nwhich stated that the information set forth under allegations 1.b through 1.d, and 1.f, are \ncognizable under this guideline as well. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant \ndenied both allegations under this paragraph. \n3.a. Applicant filled out a Government questionnaire on December 21, 2018. (Item \n2.) Section 22 of the questionnaire asked questions about Applicant\u2019s police record. One \nsubpart of the question asked, \u201cHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving \nalcohol or drugs?\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Applicant answered the question, \u201cNo.\u201d This \nwas a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant\u2019s criminal history involving the \nuse of alcohol. \n3.b. Section 24 of the same questionnaire concerned Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol. \nOne subpart asked, \u201cHave you EVER been ordered, advised, or asked to seek counseling \nor treatment as a result of your use of alcohol?\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Applicant \nanswered the question, \u201cNo,\u201d This was a false answer to a relevant question about \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-treatment history. \nApplicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI did not understand the questions clearly, thus \nresulting in my answering the questions incorrectly.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g, \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 23 that could potentially mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nApplicant has a history of drinking to excess until at least December 2019. He has \nbeen arrested twice for DUI, and had two serious alcohol-related incidents while in the \nMarine Corps. In addition, by his own admission, he was referred to a substance abuse \nrehabilitation program while in the Marine Corps. He may have stopped drinking for health \npurposes, but there is no corroborating evidence as to that fact. He has not mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his long-standing alcohol issues. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant had two alcohol-related arrests for DUI in 2010 and 2019. The 2010 \narrest resulted in a bench warrant being issued that Applicant had not resolved when the \nrecord closed, despite being told by two investigators of its existence. In addition, \nApplicant was involved in two serious bouts of military-related, alcohol-induced \nmisconduct that resulted in military police involvement on one occasion. Both of the above \ndisqualifying conditions have application in this case. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in 2019, three years ago. The charges in that case \nwere dismissed with prejudice due to a technicality not involving guilt or innocence. \nApplicant\u2019s long history of alcohol-related misconduct has not yet been mitigated by any \nshowing of successful rehabilitation. Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to resolve the bench \nwarrant against him is also of concern, particularly since he was twice informed of its \nexistence by Government investigators.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 2010. This arrest resulted in a bench warrant \nbeing issued for him. He also had two alcohol-related incidents in the Marine Corps. In \none of them the military police were involved. The Marine Corps referred Applicant to an \nalcohol rehabilitation program in 2010 that he did not complete. He did not report these \nfacts on his 2018 e-QIP. The above disqualifying condition has application to this case. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant argued in his Answer, \u201cI did not understand the questions clearly, thus \nresulting in my answering the questions incorrectly.\u201d This argument is rejected. The \nquestions concerning Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct and treatment are \nclear. He was obligated to answer them truthfully and he did not do so. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply to his conduct. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his past alcohol use and related criminal conduct, and his \nfalsifications on a Government questionnaire. He has not minimized the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress, and there is a strong likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the \nrecord evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 15, 47-49; AE M, AE R) \nIn March 2010, when she was in high school, Applicant was with friends at a mall \nand was caught by a security guard trying to shoplift a piece of costume jewelry from a \ndepartment store.

She completed her probation and some community service. \n(Tr. 50-51, 96-98) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nIn August or September 2010, Applicant and a friend were at the friend\u2019s house \nin State 1, where she grew up. They took a check from the friend\u2019s father\u2019s checkbook, \nfilled it out, signed his name, and used the check to withdraw money from his bank \naccount. She spent some of the money at a mall. At the time, Applicant was preparing \nto go to college, in State 2. She acknowledged when she moved to State 2, she took a \nfraudulent check, or money cashed with one, to use there \u201cto buy things.\u201d (Tr. 51-57, 70, \n98-101, 106-109) \nThe friend\u2019s father filed charges when he learned his check(s) had been stolen, \nthough Applicant testified that he tried to get the charges dropped when he learned his \ndaughter and Applicant were responsible. (Tr. 51-57) In fall 2010, when she was in \ncollege in State 2, Applicant and her college roommates were questioned by campus \npolice. Applicant was also questioned about using other people\u2019s credit cards, charges \nwere noted on her FBI record (GE 3) but she denied that conduct. (Tr. 101-106) In \nOctober 2010, she was charged, in State 2, with felony identity theft. (SOR \u00b6 1.d(i)) \nApplicant\u2019s FBI record reflects that she was also charged with multiple misdemeanor \ncounts of fraud and larceny (theft of services under $1,500), as well as misdemeanor \nunlawful use of a credit card (under $1,500). (GE 3) \nIn January 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged in State 1 with identity \nfraud and obtaining money by false pretenses, both felonies. In March 2011, Applicant \npleaded guilty to reduced misdemeanor charges, and she was sentenced to 12 months \nof jail time (10 months suspended) and three years of unsupervised probation. (GE 5) \nHer probation for the shoplifting charge above was revoked, and she was sentenced to \ntime served (about 40 days). (GE 5, GE 6; Tr. 51-57) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The State 2 charges \nwere nolle prossed, also in March 2011. (Tr. 64-71; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s public trust application included the following question: \u201cHave you \nEVER been charged with any felony offense?\u201d (GE 1 at 32) Applicant\u2019s answer of \u201cNO\u201d \nto that question is alleged as being deliberately false in both respects, since she did not \nreport her felony charges in State 1 or State 2. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d(i) and d(ii). \nNone of the State 2 misdemeanor charges were alleged in the SOR. The State 2 \nfelony charge was alleged not for the offense itself, but rather only as a falsification on \nher application for a position of public trust. (SOR \u00b6 1.d(i)) Applicant testified that she \ndid not list the State 2 felony charge on her application because she believed it had \nbeen expunged and was no longer on her record. (Tr. 71-72, 75) \nWhen asked why she did not list her State 1 felony charges on her application \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d(ii)), Applicant asserted that she was not required to report the offense \nbecause she thought (incorrectly) it had occurred more than 10 years earlier.

Applicant was given the opportunity to document that contact after the hearing, but \ndid not do so. (Tr. 71-73, 76-80) \nBy February 2018, Applicant had separated from her husband and had moved \ninto an apartment. She testified that she went to an ATM machine to make a deposit so \nshe could get a money order to pay her rent. Money was tight because she was working \nat a restaurant, with limited income. She said that the deposit jammed in the machine, \nso she could not withdraw any money. She contacted the credit union the next day. (Tr. \n57-62, 118) She also provided her apartment complex a letter from the credit union to \nshow that \u201cdue to an ATM error, the funds were not credited to her account\u201d on January \n31, 2018 and she was credited $124 the next day, February 1, 2018. (AE F(2)) \nApplicant used that letter to avoid the $500 charge for paying rent late. \nAccording to the Government\u2019s evidence, the apartment complex became \nsuspicious about the document they received from Applicant, so they contacted the \nbank, which, in turn, contacted the police. The Government\u2019s evidence includes a letter \nthat the bank received from the apartment complex, purportedly on credit union \nstationery, with a signature from the bank representative, reflecting that Applicant\u2019s \naccount had been credited $824, not $124, on February 2, 2018. (GE 4 at 4, 8) The \nletters show what the report calls \u201cobvious differences,\u201d not only in the amounts, but \nalso the stationery letterhead, the typeface, the location of the bank branch address on \nthe document, and the fact that one letter contains a signature and the other does not. \n(GE 4 at 7, 8) The matter was forwarded to the police for appropriate action. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant \u201csubstantially altered the letter and submitted \nthe altered document to her apartment complex;\u201d and that in June 2018, she was \ncharged with felony perjury \u2013 falsely swearing an oath, and felony \u201cother forgery \nwriting.\u201d In December 2018, the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 109-113) Applicant \ndenied the allegation in her answer. \nApplicant acknowledged that for February 2018, she underpaid her rent about \nhalf ($700 of $1,400), but that she paid the full rent on February 2, along with the letter \nfrom the bank. She said this was the only time she was late paying rent. (Tr. 116-123) In \nJuly 2018, Applicant\u2019s apartment complex obtained a judgment against her for unlawful \ndetainer (for non-payment of rent). (GE 4 at 9; GE 9) Applicant stated that the eviction \nprocess had begun but she was allowed to break her lease, and she did not have to \nappear in court. (Tr. 113-118) \nIn answering questions on her public trust position application about her criminal \nrecord, Applicant explained that in November 2018, she was informed by a prior \nemployer about outstanding criminal charges. She contacted county authorities, who \ntold her there was an arrest warrant for her on a perjury charge. She turned herself in, \nwas booked and released.

(Tr. \n111, 146-152, 179-180, 183-192) She also denied committing perjury in court. She said \nshe was not arrested or served a warrant; she said that the matter came up in her \nbackground check for a job interview with a bank. (Tr. 152-158) \nApplicant\u2019s FBI Record does not reflect criminal charges relating to these events, \nbut they are referenced in Applicant\u2019s report of investigation as having been discussed \nin her background interview. (GE 2 at 22-23, 30) They are also documented by AE A, a \ncourt database record provided by Applicant. \nOn multiple occasions since October 2017, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended after she failed to appear in court for traffic violations or after she failed to \npay the related fines and court costs. (SOR \u00b6 1.e(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)). Applicant \nadmitted the various suspensions, but documented that she has paid all fines and costs \nand that her driver\u2019s license has been in good standing since April 2020. (Answer; Tr. \n80-82, AE E, AE G \u2013 AE K, and AE S) \nApplicant said she was not proud of the things she did in her youth, and makes \nno excuses, but has grown. It was a dark time in her life. She denied the charge in \n2018. She is a hard-working, law-abiding citizen who is raising her son. Applicant has \nhad no other arrests or criminal offenses. (Tr. 93-94, 158-159, 181) \nThe financial allegations in the SOR mostly concern delinquent federal student \nloans (about $14,500), but also some medical debts (about $900) and two other debts \n($1,198 and $629) for a total of just over $17,000. Applicant disclosed various debts on \nher application and discussed them in her background interview. (GE 1, GE 2) The \ndebts are also established by July 2019 and February 2020 credit reports. (GE 7, GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($7,630), 1.b ($1,564), 1.c ($1,513), 1.i ($966), 1.j ($1,158) and 1.k \n($1,666) are Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans, which she used to pay for \ncollege. She has no private student loans. She dropped out of college when she gave \nbirth to her son. (Tr. 83-88) The loans all became delinquent in 2016, when she was \nworking at the restaurant. (GE 7) \nIn February 2020, Applicant was to enter into a repayment program to \nrehabilitate her defaulted loans (then totaling about $17,300) by making payments of \n$110 a month and then $5 a month on separate accounts. (GE 2 at 33; AE D; Tr. 123\u00ad\n128) It is not clear that she did so, as AE U, a February 2022 credit report, does not \nreflect that she made such payments, nor are they otherwise documented in the record. \nIn spring 2020, federal student loans were placed in forbearance or deferment \nstatus by the federal government due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Tr. 133-140) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,198) is a past-due power bill. Applicant admitted the debt but said \nher husband was responsible for it and was paying it off. She said they had trouble \nchanging the name on the account. She asserted that the account is now paid, because \nshe has an active power account with the same company. (Answer; Tr. 90-92) She \nprovided a supporting letter from her husband in which he said he was paying Applicant \nto cover the bill. (AE F(1)) However, no payments to the power company are \ndocumented. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($629) is an insurance bill reported for collections. She admitted the \ndebt in her answer, but at her hearing she asserted that her husband was responsible \nand that the debt had been taken care of.

At least one of the debts has been paid. \n(Answer; Tr. 88-89; AE Q) She has medical insurance through her job. (AE M) \nApplicant testified that her finances are now stable. According to her budget, \nApplicant reported monthly income of $3,722 and expenses of about $2,486. (AE T; Tr. \n163-164) She pays about $1,470 a month in rent and utilities. Her husband helps by \npaying $500 a month. She has a car payment of about $460. She said she pays $25 a \nmonth for a credit monitoring service. She said she had about $1,200 in her checking \naccount and about $3,000 in savings. (Tr. 128-145) Her credit score is now 611.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant was arrested and charged with shoplifting in \nMarch 2010, and was later convicted. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She was arrested and charged with \nidentity fraud and obtaining money by false pretenses, both felonies, in November 2010, \nin State 1, after she and a friend stole a check from the friend\u2019s father, signed his name, \ncashed the check, and spent the money. She later pleaded guilty to lesser \nmisdemeanor offenses. (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Those allegations constitute criminal conduct, and \nthey might have been alleged as such under Guideline J. Since they were alleged and \nestablished under Guideline E instead, AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to those allegations. \nOut of the same circumstances, Applicant also faced a felony charge of identity \ntheft in State 2, where she was attending college at the time. She failed to disclose that \nfelony charge on her application (discussed below) but the State 2 felony charge itself \nwas not alleged in the SOR (nor were a series of related misdemeanor charges, all \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s FBI record, GE 3). Since those offenses were not \nindependently alleged in SOR, no disqualifying conditions apply to them. Conduct that \nwas not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may \nbe considered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nApplicant was also charged in State 1 with perjury and other forgeries, both \nfelonies, on the basis of the false letter that was presented to her apartment complex in \nFebruary 2018. Applicant provided documentation of the charges in her own evidence \n(AE A). Further, notwithstanding the dismissal of the charges, I nonetheless find that GE \n4 provides substantial evidence that Applicant \u201csubstantially altered\u201d the letter from the \ncredit union as alleged, and submitted it to her apartment complex, which is what led \nthem to notify the credit union of their suspicions, which, in turn, led the credit union to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontact the police. Even though the charges were dismissed, the Government has met \nits burden to establish SOR \u00b6 1.c by substantial evidence, and AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s various driver\u2019s license suspensions, all alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, are \nalso established. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to them. \nOn her application for a position of public trust, Applicant offered an explanation \nfor her 2018 felony charges (SOR \u00b6 1.c) but did not list her earlier felonies arising in \neither State 1 or State 2 after she and her friend stole a check from the friend\u2019s father\u2019s \ncheckbook, signed it, cashed it, and Applicant used the money, in both State 1 and \nState 2. Applicant did not disclose those felony charges on her application, despite the \nplain language of the question (\u201cHave you EVER been charged with any felony \noffense?\u201d) calling for her to do so. I find that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d(i) \nand 1.d(ii). \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant has had several issues with her driver\u2019s license in recent years mostly \nfor unpaid fines and court costs, but they are also minor, and resolved, as she has had \na valid driver\u2019s license for almost two years. However, Applicant has a difficult record to \nmitigate. This is not only because of her criminal record, with arrests and charges in \n2010, 2011, and 2018, but also because her conduct has escalated. She began in 2010 \nwith shoplifting. Then, later that year, with a friend\u2019s help, she stole a check from the \nfriend\u2019s father\u2019s checkbook, forged his name, cashed the check at a bank, and used the \nmoney, both in State 1 and in State 2, in college. This led to felony charges of identity \ntheft and identify fraud, as well as a series of misdemeanor charges. Most recently, she \nengaged, either by herself or perhaps with help, in the fraudulent creation of a false \nletter from a credit union to evade a late fee when she could not make rent. Applicant \nhas also not admitted any wrongdoing in this latest incident, notwithstanding a strong \nsuggestion, supported by documentation from the Government, that she faked the letter \nfrom the credit union to get out of paying a late fee. Her actions suggest a pattern of \nconduct that is not only troubling but seems to be growing more sophisticated. She also \nfalsified her application in failing to disclose her older felony charges, as required by the \nplain text of the question. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that either AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c) or 17(d) should apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity [trustworthiness] concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise financial trustworthiness concerns. \nThe following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent student loans and other debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes potentially applicable \nmitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred federal student-loan debts while pursuing a college degree. \nThose debts are ongoing, as are most of her other debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant experienced financial issues before finding more steady employment in \nthe defense industry. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application, since her debts are due to some \nextent to circumstances beyond her control, including low income, marital instability, \nand unplanned medical expenses. However, she has been gainfully employed, full time, \nfor over three years. She has separated from her husband but they remain married, and \nhe provides her financial assistance. \nApplicant did not establish that she rehabilitated her delinquent federal student \nloans before the federal government placed federal student loans in forbearance status \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current forbearance status of those loans does not \nexcuse Applicant\u2019s inaction in failing to address those debts more responsibly earlier. \nShe did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that she undertook reasonable steps \nto rehabilitate her student loans even by making minimal payments. She did not \nestablish that she undertook responsible, good-faith efforts to resolve her debts. While I \nconsider that her medical debts are mitigated, her other debts are not. Applicant has \nachieved some measure of financial stability through her current employment but she \nneeds to establish a track record of addressing her debts more responsibly to establish \nmitigation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not fully apply. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or position of public trust by considering the \ntotality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative \njudge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has provided some evidence of changed circumstances. She has \nclearly struggled to get where she is in life, and is trying to improve herself financially \nand to put her difficult past behind her. I have considered her positive work and \npersonal character evidence. Her overall record, however, is difficult to overcome, \nparticularly since she seeks eligibility for a position of public trust. A person in that \nposition is entrusted with access to people\u2019s personally identifiable information. \nApplicant has already breached that trust, as she has felony charges of identity theft \nand identity fraud. She also has unresolved financial delinquencies, including federal \nstudent loan debt, and she has a prior record of engaging in identify theft and \nmisrepresentations when she is in financial trouble, a record that shows she is not a \nsuitable candidate for a position of public trust. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nApplicant has not established that she is a suitable candidate for access to sensitive \ninformation and a position of public trust. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e, 2.i-2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f-1.h: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law, five sisters-in- law, and four brothers-in-law are resident citizens of China (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The SOR also alleges that of his sisters-in-law with citizenship and residency in China, one had previously worked as a radar engineer with a missile institute in China (SOR \u00b6 1.b); another is employed as a software engineer for the Chinese government (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and a third is employed as a civil servant for a forestry bureau in China (SOR \u00b6 1.d). When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted the Chinese residency and citizenships of his spouse\u2019s family members and the alleged employment information for 3 the three sister-in-laws (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d). Yet, he explained that his spouse\u2019s relatives all speak only Mandarin so his spouse has to translate for him. Consequently, his conversations with her family members are \u201cbrief and infrequent.\u201d After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old senior systems engineer. He, his parents, and his two siblings (an older sister and a younger brother) are all native U.S. resident citizens. (GEs 1, 3.) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in May 2009 and a master\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering in May 2011. While Applicant was an undergraduate, he worked as an intern in the semiconductor industry during the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008. H",

On July 21, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing. On September 27, 2021, the case was assigned to me to \nconduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the \ncase assignment and file on October 6, 2021. \nOn February 11, 2022, I informed Applicant that I was scheduling online hearings \nvia Microsoft Teams for March 2022, and inquired about his availability for a hearing. He \nrequested a hearing on March 7, 2022 or March 8, 2022, and indicated he would waive \nthe 15-day advance-notice requirement under the Directive. On February 23, 2022, I \nscheduled a Microsoft Teams video teleconference hearing for March 8, 2022. In \nresponse to a Case Management Order of February 23, 2022, the parties provided their \nproposed exhibits in advance of the hearing. The Government also provided a July 21, \n2021 Request for Administrative Notice concerning China. \nOn March 7, 2022, I informed the parties that the file I was provided included \nApplicant\u2019s May 2020 response to DOHA interrogatories. The document was not included \nin the potential exhibits forwarded to me by the parties before the scheduled hearing. I \nadvised the parties that I would not consider it unless it was accepted in evidence at the \nhearing. \nAt the March 8, 2022 hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1 through 4), \nincluding Applicant\u2019s response to the DOHA interrogatories as GE 4, and eight Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A through H) were admitted without objection. Shortly after his March 8, \n2022 hearing, Applicant submitted by electronic mail a security contact report, which was \naccepted into evidence as AE I without any objection from the Government. Applicant \nand his spouse testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on March 15, \n2022. \nAt the Government\u2019s request, I indicated at the hearing that I would accept the \nGovernment\u2019s July 21, 2021 request for administrative notice as a hearing exhibit (HE 1), \nsubject to any comments or objections by Applicant. Applicant did not object to any of the \nfacts proposed for administrative notice, and he declined an opportunity to propose \nadditional facts for administrative notice. \nAdministrative Notice \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted for administrative notice several facts \npertinent to China, as set forth in its July 21, 2021 request for administrative notice. The \nadministrative notice request for China was based on seven issuances from the U.S. \nState Department: China 2020 Human Rights Report (Includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and \nMacau); Hong Kong Travel Advisory, dated June 16, 2021; Country Reports on Terrorism \n2019, dated June 24, 2020; China Travel Advisory, dated June 16, 2021; two press \nstatements dated January 6, 2021, and January 19, 2021; and on a statement from the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Embassy in Georgia, dated August 12, 2020. In addition, the Government requested \nadministrative notice be taken of relevant facts based on the U.S. President\u2019s Interim \nNational Security Strategic Guidance, dated March 3, 2021; a statement from the Director \nof National Intelligence, Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity, dated January 29, 2019; a report of the National Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Center, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace 2018, published July 26, \n2018; a report of the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive, Report to Congress \non Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2009-2011; a December 22, \n2020 advisory concerning data security by the Department of Homeland Security; the \nDOD\u2019s annual report to Congress on military and security developments involving China, \ndated September 1, 2020; a December 12, 2018 statement of the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral before the U.S. Senate\u2019s Committee on the Judiciary; and on eight press \nreleases from the U.S. Department of Justice reporting recent economic espionage \nactivity targeting the United States and U.S commercial entities. \nApplicant confirmed that he received the Government\u2019s request for administrative \nnotice with extracts of the source documents, and he had no objection to any of the facts \nproposed for administrative notice with respect to China. Applicant elected not to propose \nany facts of his own for administrative notice. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice of \nthe facts requested by the Government with respect to China, subject to the reliability of \nthe source documentation and the relevance and materiality of the facts proposed. \nConcerning the reports and press releases of criminal activity and export violations \non behalf of people with connections to China, they were presented by the Government \napparently to substantiate that China engages in espionage against the United States \nand actively pursues collection of U.S. economic and proprietary information. Neither \nApplicant, his spouse, nor her family members in China were implicated in that criminal \nactivity, although the Government does not have to prove that they were so implicated. \nWith those caveats, and considering the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice, \nthe facts administratively noticed are set forth below. \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law, five sisters-in-\nlaw, and four brothers-in-law are resident citizens of China (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The SOR also \nalleges that of his sisters-in-law with citizenship and residency in China, one had \npreviously worked as a radar engineer with a missile institute in China (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nanother is employed as a software engineer for the Chinese government (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \nand a third is employed as a civil servant for a forestry bureau in China (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted the Chinese residency and \ncitizenships of his spouse\u2019s family members and the alleged employment information for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe three sister-in-laws (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d). Yet, he explained that his spouse\u2019s \nrelatives all speak only Mandarin so his spouse has to translate for him. Consequently, \nhis conversations with her family members are \u201cbrief and infrequent.\u201d \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior systems engineer. He, his parents, and his two \nsiblings (an older sister and a younger brother) are all native U.S. resident citizens. (GEs \n1, 3.) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in May 2009 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering in May 2011. While Applicant was \nan undergraduate, he worked as an intern in the semiconductor industry during the \nsummers of 2006, 2007, and 2008. He did not hold a DOD security clearance during \nthose times. (GEs 1, 3; AE H.) \nOn earning his bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant worked as an intern for a defense \ncontractor (company X) in the summer of 2009. That fall, he started his graduate studies, \nand the following summer again worked for the company as an intern. In early 2011, \nApplicant and his future spouse were introduced to each other by a mutual friend. (Tr. \n45.) A native citizen of China (GE 3; Tr. 39), she was pursuing her master\u2019s degree in \nstatistics at the same university as Applicant. (Tr. 44, 50.) She began her studies in 2010. \n(Tr. 44.) Applicant and his spouse began dating in May 2011. (Tr. 46.) \nApplicant became a full-time employee of company X in June 2011. On July 7, \n2011, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) for a security clearance for company X, having no prior experience with \nthe form. (Tr. 55.) He responded negatively to an SF 86 inquiry concerning whether he \nhad any close or continuing contact with any foreign nationals within the last seven years. \n(GE 1.) He was dating his spouse, then a Chinese national, but it did not occur to him to \nreport her as a foreign contact. He does not now recall the specifics of any training that \nhe had to take while at company X, including any about reporting foreign contacts. (Tr. \n56.) Applicant was granted a DOD secret clearance in August 2011. (GE 3.) The majority \nof his work for company X from June 2011 to December 2015 was unclassified. (Tr. 13, \n32.) \nApplicant and his spouse traveled together to China on July 24, 2012. She wanted \nhim to meet her parents and other members of her immediate family. Applicant returned \nfrom China on August 10, 2012, while his spouse stayed in China for two months. (Tr. \n46.) Applicant did not report his trip to China to company X because he did not then know \nthat it was required. (Tr. 57.) \nApplicant and his spouse married in the United States in August 2015. (GE 3.) Her \nparents, two sisters, and one brother came from China for the wedding. (Tr. 51.) Applicant \ndid not report his marriage to a Chinese citizen to company X because he did not realize \nthat it was required.

Applicant told his \nimmediate manager that he was going to China as he had to obtain his approval for leave. \n(Tr. 63.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse pursued a doctorate degree in computational statistics and \nmeasurement at a public university in another U.S. state. (Tr. 50.) She attended the \ngraduation ceremony for her doctorate degree in 2016, and her parents came from China \nfor the ceremony. However, she delayed her institutional defense for three semesters \nbecause she and Applicant were expecting their first child, a daughter who was born in \nthe United States in January 2018. (GE 3; Tr. 48, 52.) She finished all the requirements \nand earned her doctorate degree in 2018. (Tr. 45.) \nIn September 2017, Applicant resigned from company X and began working as a \nsenior systems engineer for his current employer, another defense contractor. (GE 3, AE \nH.) He took the job for reasons of career advancement and less travel. (Tr. 64.) \nDuring the on-boarding process for his current employment, Applicant took some \nsecurity training (AE E), including about the requirement to report foreign contacts. (Tr. \n57.) On October 24, 2017, Applicant self-reported to his current employer\u2019s security office \nthat he was married to a Chinese citizen who holds U.S. permanent residency status (a \n\u201cgreen card\u201d); that this personal relationship began in 2011; and that he had traveled to \nChina for two weeks in 2012 and 2016 to visit his in-laws, with whom he had contact since \n2012. Applicant informed his new employer that he had not reported his spouse as a \nclose contact on his SF 86 completed in 2011 for his previous employer, and that he had \nnot told his previous employer about his marriage to a Chinese citizen or about his two \ntrips to China. Applicant provided his new employer with the names of his parents-in-law, \nhis spouse\u2019s three sisters, and her two brothers, all resident citizens of China. (GE 2.) \nApplicant offered no explanation for waiting until October 24, 2017, to inform his current \nemployer about his foreign contacts.

On \nNovember 14, 2017, Applicant\u2019s employer filed an adverse information report to the DOD \nabout Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and his failure to report them to his previous employer. \n(GE 2.) \nOn February 9, 2018, Applicant completed an SF 86 on which he reported his \nAugust 2015 marriage to a Chinese citizen who was subsequently granted U.S. \npermanent residency. He included as family members his parents-in-law, both resident \ncitizens of China, and stated that he had in-person contact with them during his two trips \nto China, at his wedding to their daughter in the United States, and \u201clast year.\u201d Applicant \nreported that they came to the United States to help with his first child on her birth. He \nexplained that his in-laws speak only Mandarin, so his spouse has to translate their \nconversations.

He included as reportable foreign travel his trips to \nChina in July 2012 and May 2016. He responded negatively to inquiries concerning \nwhether he had been detailed by local customs or security service officials; whether he \nhad any encounters with the police; whether he had been in contact with any person \nsuspected of being involved or associated with any foreign intelligence, terrorist, security \nor military organizations; whether he had been involved in any counterintelligence or \nsecurity issues; whether he had been in contact with anyone showing undue interest in \nhis job or attempting to obtain classified or sensitive information from him; and whether \nhe had been coerced, threatened, or pressured in any way to cooperate with a foreign \ngovernment official or foreign intelligence or security service. (GE 3.) \nOn January 16, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in part about his foreign contacts. He \nindicated that he and his spouse were in the process of renewing her U.S. permanent \nresidency status (which was scheduled to expire on January 19, 2019, see GE 3) and \nremoving the conditions on her U.S. permanent residency. She completed the biometrics \nrequirements on January 3, 2019. Applicant stated that he and his spouse planned to \ncontinue to reside in the United States, but he was uncertain whether she intended to \nacquire U.S. citizenship. Applicant indicated that with respect to his spouse\u2019s family \nmembers in China, he planned to maintain \u201cminimal contact\u201d with them in the future. (GE \n4.) \nOn February 12, 2019, Applicant reported through his employer\u2019s computer-based \nSecurity Contact Reporting and International Protection Travel System that he planned \npersonal travel to China from March 30, 2019 to April 13, 2019, to visit a sister-in-law and \nher family and his parents-in-law. (AE I.) His U.S. passport shows the travel occurred from \nApril 3, 2019, to April 13, 2019. (Tr. 47.) Applicant was accompanied by his spouse and \ntheir daughter, who remained in China for two months. (Tr. 47.) Applicant has not been \nto China since that trip. (Tr. 60.) His spouse and daughter again traveled to China in \nOctober 2019 as her mother was in ill health. They stayed in China for \u201cnearly two \nmonths.\u201d (Tr. 48.) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on May 29, 2020, that he \nand his spouse had discussed her intentions about acquiring U.S. citizenship and that \nshe believed it would be beneficial for her career. (GE 4.) She became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen on April 29, 2021. (Tr. 37-38.) While she retains her Chinese passport, she \nunderstands that it is invalid and that she is no longer a citizen of China. China does not \nrecognize dual citizenship, and when she entered her passport number into the computer, \nthere was no record of her holding a Chinese passport.

Applicant had in-person contact with his \nparents-in-law in the United States at his wedding to their daughter, and for about six \nweeks in early 2018 when they came to help care for his newborn daughter. (GEs 3-4.) \nApplicant has not had any contact with his parents-in-law since his trip to China in April \n2019. (Tr. 60.) Since they do not speak English (Tr. 36), and he does not speak Mandarin \nChinese (Tr. 60), he does not converse with them when his spouse calls them.

President Xi \nhas very few checks on his power as Beijing continues to restrict the personal freedoms \nof its citizens. China is the only competitor potentially capable of mounting a sustained \nchallenge to a stable and open international system. Along with Russia, China presents \na persistent cyber espionage and cyber-attack threat to the U.S. core military and critical \ninfrastructure systems. The country has expansive efforts in place to acquire U.S. \ntechnology, to include trade secrets and propriety information. To support its military \nmodernization, China fills the gaps in its defense and commercial research by engaging \nin large-scale, state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information. \nIn accord with its national security objective to leverage legally and illegally acquired dual-\nuse and military-related technologies to its advantage, China uses its intelligence \nservices, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches to obtain national security and \nexport-controlled technologies, controlled equipment, and other materials. China\u2019s \ninfluence operations are coordinated at a high level within the party-state. \nChina leverages foreign investments, commercial joint ventures, academic \nexchanges, the experience of Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored \nindustrial and technical espionage to increase the level of technologies and expertise \navailable to support its military research, development, and acquisition. China blends \nintelligence and non-intelligence assets and frequently seeks to exploit Chinese citizens \nor persons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to steal trade secrets \nfrom U.S. companies. China\u2019s \u201cThousand Talents Program\u201d seeks to recruit individuals \nfrom diaspora populations and recent emigrants to obtain scientific and technical \ninformation necessary for modernization of its defense technology. China\u2019s National \nIntelligence Law of 2017 compels all Chinese firms and entities to support, assist, and \ncooperate with Chinese intelligence services, and to turn over any data collected abroad \nor domestically to the Chinese government. The law provides for incentives for \ncompliance and penalties for noncompliance. \nAbout 80% of all economic espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice have involved allegations of trade secret theft that would benefit \nChina. About 60% of all trade secret theft cases had some nexus to China. It led the \nUnited States to launch a China initiative within the Department aimed at identifying and \nprosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, computer hacking, and economic \nespionage with a dual focus of protecting the U.S. critical infrastructure against external \nthreats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises, and combating \ncovert efforts to influence the American public and policymakers without proper \ntransparency. \nIn June 2020, a Chinese citizen was convicted of economic espionage, theft of \ntrade secrets, and conspiracy to commit theft from two U.S. companies of semiconductor \ntechnology for China. He plotted with a Chinese university to steal the trade secrets for \nthe benefit of China\u2019s government. \nOn July 23, 2020, the United States closed the Chinese Consulate in Houston, \nTexas, as the consulate was particularly aggressive in illegal spying and influence \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noperations and directly involved in fraud and theft of intellectual property from research \ninstitutions and companies in Texas.

During a personal trip to China from December 2018 to \nJanuary 2019, he brought unclassified technical information in his company-issued \ncomputer, in knowing violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic \nin Arms Regulations. \nIn January 2021, a Chinese national was charged with criminal conspiracy to \nexport U.S. power amplifiers to China from 2012 to 2015. He is alleged to have caused \nat least 18 shipments of export-controlled goods from the United States to Hong Kong, \nknowing that the goods would be then shipped to China. \nIn February 2021, a Chinese businessman residing in Hong Kong was indicted for \nconspiring to steal a U.S. company\u2019s trade secrets involving a silicon carbide technology \nworth millions with the intent of producing the technology in China. His co-conspirator \nallegedly was an engineer for the victimized company. \nIn April 2021, a Chinese national living in the United States, who had been admitted \nto the United States through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program in 2014, pled \nguilty to conspiracy to unlawfully exporting hydrophones used for anti-submarine warfare \nfrom the United States to a Chinese military university without the required export \nlicenses; visa fraud; making false statements to law enforcement agents regarding his \ncustomers and types of parts exported to China; money laundering; and smuggling \nhydrophones to the Chinese military university. The university has been on the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Entity List for national security reasons since 2001. \nIn May 2021, a university researcher in the United States with strong ties to China \nwas sentenced to 37 months in prison for making false statements to federal authorities \nas part of an immunology research fraud scheme. He had lied on applications to use \napproximately $4.1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health to develop \nChina\u2019s expertise in rheumatology and immunology. For years, he concealed his \nparticipation in Chinese government talent recruitment programs and his affiliations with \nat least five research institutions in China. \nIn June 2021, the U.S. State Department issued a level 3 travel advisory for China \ndue to China\u2019s arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including carrying out unlawful \ndetentions and using bans on U.S. citizens and those of other countries without due \nprocess of law to compel individuals to participate in Chinese government investigations; \npressure family members to return to China from abroad; influence Chinese authorities \nto resolve civil disputes in favor of Chinese citizens; and gain bargaining leverage over \nforeign governments.

Members of the security forces in \nChina committed serious and pervasive abuses in 2020. Genocide and crimes against \nhumanity occurred against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethic and \nreligious minority groups in Xinjiang. Arbitrary detention by the government included the \nmass detention of more than one million Uyghurs and other members of predominantly \nMuslim minority groups in extrajudicial internment camps and subjected two million more \nto daytime-only \u201cre-education\u201d training. Other significant human rights abuses included \narbitrary or unlawful killings, forced disappearances, and torture by the government; harsh \nand life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; the lack of an independent \njudiciary and Communist Party control over the judicial and legal system; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy; pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance and monitoring; \nserious restrictions on free expression of the press and Internet with censorship and site \nblocking; interference with the rights of peaceful assembly, freedom of movement, \nassembly, and association; the inability of citizens to choose their government and \nrestrictions on political participation; serious corruption; forced sterilization and abortion; \nforced labor and trafficking in person; several restrictions on labor rights; and child labor. \nGovernment officials and security services often committed human rights abuses with \nimpunity. \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and his spouse\u2019s siblings and their spouses are all \nresident citizens of China. Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to these \nforeign citizens are warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk under \nAG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying \nconditions provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the \nnature of its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated \nwith, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s family members in China have \nengaged in any activities contrary to U.S. interests or that they have been targeted or \npressured. However, China is an authoritarian state with an extensive, pervasive history \nof engaging in economic and technological espionage against the United States. The \ncountry\u2019s poor human rights record and its efforts to acquire sensitive technology from \nthe U.S. and U.S.-based entities, which includes the implementation of legislation and \nprograms to that end, continue to hinder relations between the United States and China. \nIt is conceivable that China could use Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law or his spouse\u2019s siblings \nor their spouses to obtain sensitive information from Applicant, especially if Chinese \nauthorities learn of his defense contractor employment and his regular access to \nclassified information with military applications. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law #2 is married to \na woman who was previously employed as a software engineer for a satellite control \ncenter affiliated with China\u2019s military or government (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Brother-in-law #1 is \nmarried to a woman who is now on the faculty of a Chinese university of politics and law. \nHowever, as recently as February 2018, she was employed as a radar engineer at a \nChinese military university (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Sister-in-law #2 had a civil service position with \na forestry bureau as of January 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). While there is nothing about work at a \nforestry bureau that suggests a heightened concern, and she is not currently working \nbecause she has to care for her spouse, there is little information in the record about her \nactivities and associates. Given the substantial familial ties in China, Applicant has a \nheavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that his and his spouse\u2019s relationships and \ncontacts with her family in China present an acceptable security risk. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has close ties of affection to her parents in China, whom she \ncontacts weekly or every other week. Since meeting Applicant in early 2011, she has \ntraveled to China with him at least three times: in July 2012 so that he could meet her \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfamily; in May 2016 for a cousin\u2019s wedding; and in April 2019 with their young daughter. \nShe remained in China for two months during her trips with Applicant in July 2012 and \nApril 2019 and during a subsequent trip with her daughter in October 2019. She intends \nto travel to China in the future to see her parents when COVID-19 pandemic-related \nrestrictions are eased by China if she is granted a visa. Her parents attended her August \n2015 wedding to Applicant in the United States. They came for six weeks around the time \nthat she and Applicant had their first child in January 2018, and they were present for her \ndoctorate-degree ceremony in 2016. Applicant\u2019s spouse has less contact with her \nsiblings. She speaks with them on Chinese holidays, such as Chinese New Year and \nAutumn Festival, but two of her sisters and her twin brother attended her wedding to \nApplicant in the United States. She visits with her siblings and their spouses when she is \nin China. \nApplicant had in-person contact with his parents-in-law and spouse\u2019s siblings \nduring his trips to China. He had contact with his parents-in-law and two of his sisters-in-\nlaw and a brother-in-law in the United States during his and his spouse\u2019s wedding. He \nhad in-person contact with his parents-in-law during the six weeks they were in the United \nStates in early 2018, although it is unclear whether his parents-in-law stayed with him and \nhis spouse in their home. He does not have any ongoing contact by telephone or \nelectronic means with his spouse\u2019s family members because of the language barrier. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of his or her spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, 2013). Applicant does not appear to be close to his \nspouse\u2019s family. However, Applicant understandably has close bonds of affection and \nobligation to his spouse. There is a theoretical risk of pressure or coercion that could be \nexercised against Applicant through his spouse and her close bonds to her immediate \nfamily members, especially to her parents but also to her siblings in China. These \nrelationships create a potential conflict of interest for Applicant between his obligation to \nprotect sensitive information and his desire to help his wife or her family members. AGs \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not timely report his dating relationship or \nhis marriage to his spouse, who was a Chinese national before she acquired her U.S. \ncitizenship in April 2021. He testified that it did not occur to him to report her as a close \nforeign contact, despite the fact that he held a clearance for his duties and despite the \noften-reported strained relationship between China and the United States. Yet, the \nGovernment did not allege the failure to report as an issue of security concern that could \npossibly have triggered disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(c), \u201cfailure to report or fully disclose, \nwhen required, association with a foreign person, group, government, or country.\u201d In ISCR \nCase No. 12-11375 at 6 (App. Bd.

Oct. 24, 2003), \nthe Appeal Board reiterated: \n15 \n \n[C]onduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered for limited purposes, \nsuch as assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; evaluating an applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; considering \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or \nproviding evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive \u00b6 6.3. \nIn accord with Appeal Board precedent, the issue of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely report his \nforeign contacts will not be considered as a basis to deny clearance eligibility. The \nGovernment\u2019s case for application of AG \u00b6 7(c) is unfounded. That said, the reporting of \nforeign contacts is relevant to assessing mitigation and the whole-person evaluation. \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 warrant some discussion in this case. \nThey are: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s relationship with his spouse\u2019s family may reasonably be \ncharacterized as distant, the closeness of the familial ties of these Chinese resident \ncitizens to his spouse; China\u2019s ongoing aggressive targeting of U.S. defense technology \nand intellectual property; China\u2019s poor human rights record; and the Chinese military or \ngovernment-affiliated employments to as recently as 2018 or 2019 of his spouse\u2019s \nbrothers\u2019 spouses, preclude mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). Although not alleged as raising \ndisqualifying security concern, two of his spouse\u2019s family members (her twin brother and \nher older brother\u2019s spouse) are faculty members at their respective universities. As of \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86, his spouse\u2019s oldest sister was a professor at a university of science \nand technology in China. It is unclear whether any of his spouse\u2019s family members in \nChina are or were members of the Chinese Communist Party, either voluntarily or as a \nrequirement of their jobs. Even so, it is possible that pressure could be placed on \nApplicant through his spouse\u2019s ties to her parents and her siblings and their spouses. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) has some applicability in that Applicant has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. Applicant, his parents, and siblings are all \nnative-born U.S. citizens. Applicant was raised and educated in the United States. All of \nhis financial assets, including home ownership, are in the United States. His two children \nwere born here. He and his spouse intend to remain permanently in the United States. \nTo that end, his spouse became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2021, knowing that \nChina does not recognize dual citizenship. She has a U.S. passport. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant has any close relatives of his own in China. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies in that Applicant\u2019s contacts and communications with his parents-\nin-law and his spouse\u2019s siblings are infrequent. There is no evidence that Applicant has \nspoken to any of his spouse\u2019s family members since his last trip to China in April 2019. \nThere is significant mitigating information in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nRegarding the Government\u2019s concerns about Applicant\u2019s failure to inform company \nX, his first defense-contractor employer, about his dating relationship and then marriage \nto a Chinese national, it was not shown that he knowingly violated any policy or \nrequirement in that regard. He testified that he cannot recall any security briefings or \ntrainings at his former employment. Security Executive Agent Directive 3 (SEAD 3) \nestablished reporting requirements for personnel with access to classified information or \nwho hold a sensitive position. Under SEAD 3, unofficial foreign travel and continuing \nassociation with known foreign nationals that involve bonds of affection, personal \nobligation, or intimate contact, are reportable activities. However, SEAD 3 was not \neffective until June 12, 2017, about three months before Applicant left company X for his \ncurrent employment. There is no evidence that Applicant was made aware of his reporting \nresponsibilities before he left company X. \n17 \n \nOf some concern is Applicant\u2019s delay in informing his current employer about his \nmarriage to a then Chinese national. He testified that he learned of the requirement during \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nonboard briefings in mid-September 2017, but he waited until October 24, 2017, to inform \nhis current employer. He could not explain the delay in reporting the information other \nthan that it occurred to him that it was important information. Applicant is credited with the \nvoluntary disclosure, however. Also in his favor, his former and current managers hold \nhim in high regard. He has demonstrated that he can handle classified information \nappropriately. Since beginning his present employment in September 2017, he has taken \nnumerous trainings that have educated him about his security responsibilities, including \nthe requirement to report foreign travel. He made a timely report of his April 2019 trip to \nChina via his employer\u2019s Security Contact Reporting & International Protection Travel \nSystem computer program, which provides assurance that he will report any future foreign \ntravel or contacts. \nHowever, in foreign influence cases it must be acknowledged that people act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member. \nAs reiterated by the Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 19-01688 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, \n2020), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d Moreover, in \nevaluating Guideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. \nISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (internal citation omitted). \nApplicant\u2019s familial ties to China through his spouse currently present an \nunacceptable risk of undue foreign influence for the reasons noted above. His spouse \nintends to travel to China within the next year if she obtains a visa. Based on her history \nof previous travel, she is likely to take their two children with her and stay for an extended \nperiod. While she now enjoys the protections of U.S. citizenship, China has not always \nrespected the rights of foreign travelers or its own citizens. Some of her siblings and their \nspouses have held or continue to hold positions that could bring their activities to the \nattention of Chinese authorities. The issue under Guideline B is whether Applicant could \nfind himself in an untenable position of having to choose between the interests of his \nspouse or her family members China and his obligations as a clearance holder. Any \ncountry whose policies consistently threaten U.S. national security may be viewed as \nhostile for purposes of DOHA adjudications. See ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 4 (App. Bd. \nJuly 29, 2020), citing e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019). Given \nChina\u2019s aggressive targeting of U.S. defense technology, it is conceivable that China \ncould exert pressure on Applicant through his spouse and her close bonds to her family \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nin China.

Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $11,400. Applicant incurred \nthis debt to purchase a car for his then-wife. He could not afford to continue the make the \npayments, and he surrendered the car to the lender. The original amount of the loan was \nabout $46,000. The loan was charged off in the amount of $27,000. When he returned \nthe vehicle in 2014, he did not believe that he owed anything further on the loan. He \nlearned about the debt during his background interview in 2018 and again in the SOR. \nHe has no documentation to show that the debt was fully repaid with the return of the car. \nHe has taken no further steps to resolve the debt since he returned the vehicle. This debt \nis not resolved. (Tr. at 41-43; GE 2 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 3.) \n1.c. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $6,633. This debt is for a third \nauto loan. According to the credit reports in the record, Applicant took out this loan in \n2012 and stopped paying on the loan in 2013. In his background interview, he recognized \nthe debt as his loan for a car he purchased in 2012. At the hearing, he testified that he \ndisputed this debt because he never had a third vehicle. He believed this debt is not his \nobligation. He suggested that it could be his father\u2019s debt since their names are almost \nidentical. He has no documentation to support his claim that the debt is not his liability. \nThe credit reports reflect that he stopped paying on this loan in June 2013 before he \npurchased in August 2013 the car with the loan discussed in 1.a, above. The Government \nestablished by substantial evidence that this debt is owed by Applicant. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. at 45-47; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 3.) \n1.d. Medical collection debt in the approximate amount of $952. Applicant admitted \nthis debt in the Answer. His statement in his Answer that he is \u201ccurrently mak[ing] \npayments on this [debt]\u201d is incorrect. He testified that he personally visited a nearby VA \nhospital about this bill, and he believes that the VA has taken responsibility for the debt. \nHe has no documentation to support this belief. This debt remains on the Government\u2019s \nmost recent credit report in the record. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 26-30; GE 4 at 2; \nGE 5 at 2.) \n1.e. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $3,089. This debt is for a \npayday loan Applicant incurred a number of years ago. He admitted the debt in the \nAnswer. He testified that he paid the debt for a period and then he stopped receiving \ncorrespondence from the creditor. He wrote in the Answer that he \u201cassumed [the loan] \nwas paid off.\u201d He added that he would follow up with the creditor. He called the creditor \nand was advised that the debt was resolved. He received nothing in writing.

This debt arose out of a \nDecember 2011 payday loan that Applicant defaulted on in approximately December \n2012. He was experiencing serious financial problems at that time. He has done nothing \nsince 2012 to repay this loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 48-51; GE 2 at 7; GE 5 at \n2; GE 6 at 4.) \n1.g Collection debt in the approximate amount of $1,128. This debt is for a gym \nmembership that became delinquent in August 2017. Applicant disputed this debt in the \nAnswer claiming that he never had a gym membership. When he learned about the debt \nduring his background interview, he called the gym and advised the creditor that he was \nnever a member. He mailed the gym a copy of a bill to show the creditor that he lived in \nanother state. The debt appears on a credit report submitted by the Government. \nApplicant provided no documentation in support of his claimed dispute. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. at 51-55; GE 2 at 7; GE 6 at 8.) \nMitigation \nApplicant has provided little evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised \nby his financial delinquencies. He testified that he has purchased a home and new \nvehicles, but he provided no budgetary information that would support a conclusion that \nhe is presently living within his means and has the financial ability to repay his delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. at 10.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed a total of approximately \n$39,000 on seven past-due debts. These facts are established by the three most recent \ncredit reports in the record (GE 4-6). Accordingly, the foregoing disqualifying conditions \nare established, and the burden of proof shifts to Applicant to mitigate those security \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue. \nOverall, Applicant has not established any of the above mitigating conditions. The \ndebts remain outstanding and cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. He has not acted responsibly in addressing his debts since he became \nemployed in 2018. He has not provided credible evidence that he has paid or otherwise \nresolved these debts. He has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay the debts nor has \nhe provided any documented proof to substantiate the basis of his disputes of certain \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s claim that he has no documents to support his position that some of \nthe debts have been resolved because his personal property was lost due to hurricane \ndamage is unconvincing. He could have tried to contact the creditors and sought new \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumentation. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s claims of resolutions or disputes of certain debts \nare not credible in light of the fact that the debts remain on his credit reports. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his financial situation. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(AE A) \nApplicant expects his divorce to be final at the end of March 2022. (Tr. 46) His \nspouse is employed outside her home. (Tr. 43) He provides $1,500 to $1,700 monthly to \nhis spouse for support. (Tr. 43; AE I) Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) \nindicates his monthly gross income is $8,442, and his net monthly income is $7,802. (Tr. \n44, 49; AE F) His PFS net monthly remainder is $1,613. (Tr. 45; AE F) However, he \nincluded his rent ($1,300) in the PFS debt section and in his PFS expense section, which \nresulted in a double deduction from his net income. (AE F) He did not include his monthly \nspousal support ($1,500) as an expense. (Id.) He included his spouse\u2019s income ($2,692) \nin the PFS gross monthly income. (Id.) He did not show any payments to address his \nstudent loans on his PFS. (Id.) Consequently, his available monthly remainder is much \nless than the $1,613 he indicated in his PFS. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file his federal income tax return for tax year \n(TY) 2016, and SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges he owed $1,500 in federal income taxes for TY 2016. \nApplicant said his marital difficulties distracted him, and he forgot to file his federal income \ntax return for TY 2016. (Tr. 20) He never filed his federal income tax return for TY 2016. \nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax return for him and transferred about $730 \nfrom his refund for TY 2017 or 2018 to pay his taxes for TY 2016.

See Federal Student Aid website, \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nApplicant said he contacted the creditor, and he planned to start making payments \nin May 2022. (Tr. 26) A university-related creditor recently emailed Applicant that he had \nan outstanding tuition balance of $10,794, and the creditor suggested settlement of the \ndebt for a lesser amount or that he establish a payment plan.

(GE 4 at 2) When Applicant moved out of \nan apartment, he called the furniture owner and told them to pick-up their furniture. (Tr. \n29) The owner picked up the furniture, and Applicant said he paid $185, which resolved \nthe debt. (Tr. 29; AE D)  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.k allege charged-off debts for $1,879 and $2,938. Applicant said \nthe debts resulted from credit cards that he shared with his spouse. (Tr. 32, 34) The debts \nhave been delinquent for two or three years. (Tr. 32, 34) He expects family court to \nallocate these debts to him or his spouse in the divorce. (Tr. 34) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.j, 1.l, and 1.n allege seven delinquent medical debts for $160, \n$95, $92, $62, $48, $1,378, and $160. Applicant was unaware of the debts because he \nbelieved his medical insurance paid for his medical care.

(Tr. 35; AE E) On March \n2, 2022, a medical creditor wrote that Applicant paid $800 toward a judgment of $1,155. \n(AE E) He said all of the SOR medical debts were paid in full. (Tr. 32, 34, 37; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $438. On \nMarch 2, 2021, Applicant paid this debt, and he provided a receipt showing payment. (Tr. \n36; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges in 2017 Applicant was evicted and owes his landlord $2,700. \nOn March 14, 2017, April 7, 2017, and May 10, 2017, his landlord obtained three default \njudgments against Applicant totaling about $3,000. (GE 5) Applicant said about two years \nago he discussed the debt with the creditor; however, he did not agree to the amount of \nthe debt or make any payments. (Tr. 39) There is no evidence of subsequent \ncommunications between Applicant and this creditor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges in April 2004, Applicant filed for bankruptcy, and in July 2004, \nhis nonpriority and unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCode.

(Tr. 40) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

May 2, 1996). \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra.  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant indicated three circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his \nfinances: (1) unemployment; (2) separation; and (3) pending divorce. However, \u201c[e]ven if \n[an applicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the \napplicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether \nhe or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments \nto keep debts current. Applicant did not provide supporting documentary evidence that \nhe maintained contact with several creditors. He did not provide documentary evidence \nof settlements or written offers to settle with several of his creditors. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for TY 2016 and to timely \npay any taxes due. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) \na federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax return for TY 2016 against him as a crime. In regard to the \nfailure to timely file this federal income tax return, the DOHA Appeal Board has \ncommented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant provided some important evidence of mitigation in this case. I have \ncredited him with mitigating of the following SOR debts: the furniture debt in \u00b6 1.d by \npaying $187; the medical debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.j, 1.l, and 1.n because of his payments; \nthe telecommunications debt in \u00b6 1.m for $438, which he paid; and the credit card debts \nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.e for $1,879 and SOR \u00b6 1.k for $2,938, which are pending allocation in family \ncourt. He is credited with mitigation of his bankruptcy in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) because it is \nnot recent. \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of payments to address his student loan \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $43,276. His reliance on the COVID-19 pandemic-based \nstudent loans deferment to establish mitigation for security clearance purposes is \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmisplaced.

He did not establish he was unable to establish a payment plan and make \nsome payments in 2018, 2019, or early 2020. \nApplicant did not mitigate the $2,700 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o related to his 2017 eviction. \nThe creditor obtained judgments against Applicant, and he has not taken any recent \naction to resolve this debt. He did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress \nsooner filing his federal income tax return for TY 2016 and paying his tax debt for that \nyear. He failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he tests virtual reality software for a DOD contractor. \nIn 2005, he received an associate\u2019s degree in computer network technology. He served \nin the Navy from 1989 to 2009, and he honorably retired as a petty officer first class. He \nhas a 70 percent VA disability rating. There is no evidence that Applicant uses illegal \ndrugs, violated security, or has issues with excessive alcohol consumption. \nApplicant did not prove he lacked sufficient financial resources to pay his debts, \nincluding his taxes. The only areas of recent financial irresponsibility are his history of \nfailing to timely file his federal income tax return and timely pay any taxes when due for \nTY 2016, his failure to establish a payment plan to address his student loans from 2018 \nto early 2020, and his failure to pay a debt owed to his landlord. His other SOR debts and \nhis bankruptcy in 2004 are mitigated. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated\u201d). \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id. \nat 5. \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his federal income tax return for TY 2016, to timely pay his taxes, \nstudent loans, and other debts in the context of his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. However, like the applicant in ISCR Case No. 15-03481, he did not establish \nhe was unable to make greater progress sooner in the resolution of his financial issues. \nHis actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate \nsecurity concerns. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d through 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He stated \nthat he changed banks and did not have documents establishing the payments. The \ndebts are reported by all three credit-reporting agencies on the February 2018 \ncombined credit report, and they both appear on the March 2020 Equifax credit report. \nThe debts do not appear on the October 2021 Equifax credit report nor the February \n2022 Experian credit report. The debts did not \u201cage off\u201d the reports because they were \nnot past the seven-year reporting window.

The defaulted auto loan, which he has been paying since April \n2021, is the only delinquent account with a balance reported on the two most recent \ncredit reports.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment and being a single \nparent without the benefit of child support from his child\u2019s mother. He also admitted that \nhe made irresponsible financial decisions. \nApplicant began paying his debts before he received the SOR. He paid four \nsmall debts and other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He has a $505-per-month \npayment plan for the repossessed vehicle loan, and he documented ten payments \ntotaling $5,050. He has legitimate questions about the validity of the 13 medical debts \nand the 2 remaining small non-medical debts. None of the debts appear on the October \n2021 Equifax credit report or the February 2022 Experian credit report. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \nApplicant has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. His finances no longer generate questions about his \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about his finances are mitigated. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana sporadically from when he was a teenager until about \n2017. He used Xanax that was not prescribed to him in 2009. He used cocaine in 2011 \nand 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since 2017. He credibly testified that he \nwants to be a good role model for his child, and he does not intend to use marijuana or \nany other illegal drug in the future. He fully disclosed his drug involvement on his SF-86 \nand throughout the security clearance proceedings, which bolsters his credibility. His \nconduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nfind that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and \nthat illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was arrested in September 2013 and charged with assault upon the \nmother of his child. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) have some applicability. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly denied striking the mother of his child. He stated that she \ncalled the police and claimed that he pushed her against a wall after he asked her to \nmove out of his apartment. The charge was dismissed in December 2014 after the \ncounty attorney moved the court to dismiss the charge because the \u201cevidence [was] \ninsufficient.\u201d I also note that Applicant has had custody of their child since about 2015; \nthis was his only arrest; and there are no other allegations of domestic violence. \nI find that the conduct is unsubstantiated and from a source of questionable \nreliability; it is unlikely to recur; it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment; and it does not serve as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(e), and 17(g) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, and H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines E, F, and H.  \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.j, and stated that the alleged debts were paid. Applicant is 33 years old. He married his wife in 2013. They have four children. He served on active duty in the Army from June 2008 to March 2017. He received a secret security clearance in 2008. He was a specialist, E-4, when he was honorably discharged. He immediately enlisted in the National Guard and was placed on yearly orders until he started his current position in November 2017 with a defense contractor. He is a field service representative. After beginning his job, he returned to reserve duty with the National Guard. He is a staff sergeant, E-6. His wife was on active duty in the Army for ten years, during the same time period as Applicant. (Tr. 17-21; GE 1 at 32) When Applicant and his wife were discharged from the Army in March 2017, they had a combined annual income of about $96,000. After leaving, his wife started nursing school and stopped working. They then lived on his National Guard income, which was about $30,000. She is still in school, and he continues to support the family on his current salary of about $49,000.

I received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He \ndenied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.j, and stated that the alleged debts were \npaid. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He married his wife in 2013. They have four children. He \nserved on active duty in the Army from June 2008 to March 2017. He received a secret \nsecurity clearance in 2008. He was a specialist, E-4, when he was honorably discharged. \nHe immediately enlisted in the National Guard and was placed on yearly orders until he \nstarted his current position in November 2017 with a defense contractor. He is a field \nservice representative. After beginning his job, he returned to reserve duty with the \nNational Guard. He is a staff sergeant, E-6. His wife was on active duty in the Army for \nten years, during the same time period as Applicant. (Tr. 17-21; GE 1 at 32) \nWhen Applicant and his wife were discharged from the Army in March 2017, they \nhad a combined annual income of about $96,000. After leaving, his wife started nursing \nschool and stopped working. They then lived on his National Guard income, which was \nabout $30,000. She is still in school, and he continues to support the family on his current \nsalary of about $49,000. (Tr. 20-23) \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from March 2019, November 2019, January \n2021, and April 2022, the SOR alleged ten delinquent debts, which totaled $41,335 and \nbecame delinquent between 2014 and 2019. (GE 2, 3, 4, 7) The status of each debt is \nlisted below: \n1.a. The $14,572 charged-off account is owed to NF credit union for a $22,000 \npersonal loan Applicant and his wife took out in 2016 to purchase a used car. They made \npayments up to the time he left active duty in March 2017. He still has the car. He \nacknowledged that this is his debt. The debt no longer appears on his CBR, so he has \nbeen unable to locate the creditor to work out a settlement. (Tr. 23-26) The debt is \nunresolved. \n1.b. The $13,127 charged-off account is owed to NF for a loan he took out in 2012 \nto purchase a 2007 truck. In late 2014, he sold it to another service member, who wrote \nhim a check for the balance due on his loan. That checked bounced and he became \nresponsible for the loan balance. He reported the theft to the police. He has been unable \nto locate the service member or the necessary documents from the sale of the truck, \nwhich are necessary to bring charges. (Tr. 26-32; GE 2 at 3) This debt is unresolved. \n1.c. The $4,632 charged-off account was owed to CO for a car loan. After the car \nwas voluntarily repossessed, it was immediately sold. Applicant negotiated a settlement \nfor the balance owed and paid it in 2018. (Tr. 33-34; GE 7 at 6) This debt is resolved. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n         \n1.d. The $4,080 charged-off account was owed to PI for a personal loan that \nApplicant took out to buy a motorcycle. The debt was paid in March 2021. (Tr. 35-36; AE \nA at 5) This debt is resolved. \n1.e. The $3,391 cell phone bill was paid on May 10, 2022. (Tr. 36-37; AE A at 6) \nThis debt is resolved. \n1.f. The $652 credit card debt was paid on May 15, 2022. (Tr. 38-39; AE A 7) This \ndebt is resolved. \n1.g. The $341 debt was owed to a company for automobile insurance. It was paid \nin February 2021. (Tr. 39; GE 7 at 2) This debt is resolved. \n1.h. The $232 medical bill was paid in February 2021. (Tr. 39; GE 7 at 2) This debt \nis resolved. \n This $163 debt is a duplicate of the credit card debt listed in \u00b6 1.f, but references \na lesser balance because Applicant had made payments on the debt. It was resolved in \nMay 2022, as noted above. (Tr. 40-41) \n1.j. The $145 medical debt was paid in February 2021. (Tr. 41-42; GE 7 at 2) This \ndebt is resolved. \nApplicant has two debts that were not alleged in the SOR. A delinquent account \nfor $1,354, which is owed to OPP for a personal loan he took out in October 2019 to cover \nwork expenses. It was reported as charged-off in March 2022. He made payments on it \nin January and February 2022 according to his April 2022 CBR. (Tr. 43; AE 7 at 4) In April \n2022, a college reported a delinquent debt of $3,984 for a training class he took. (GE 7 \nat 2) He established a payment plan with the college and has made four bi-weekly \npayments of $250 on the debt. (Tr. 44) Both are being resolved. \nApplicant has not participated in credit or budget counseling. (Tr. 50) He said his \nwife helps with their finances and he is more confident about his financial situation \nbecause of his current position. (Tr. 46) In his post-hearing submission, he said he \ncontacted Military One Source and would be working with them for assistance with his \nbudget.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline lists several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. The following two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts between 2014 and 2019, two of which he \nhas been unable to pay or resolve. The evidence establishes both disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following five are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has two old delinquent debts relating to automobile purchases, which he \nmade while serving in the Army and prior to his discharge in 2017. They total about \n$28,000 and remain unresolved. Since then, two other debts were charged off in early \n2022, which total about $5,300. While he has resolved the majority of the SOR-alleged \ndebts, the recent debts raise some question about his financial reliability. The evidence \nestablishes limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). There is evidence that some debts are \nattributable to a significant decrease in his family income when he and his wife left the \nArmy in March 2017. In addition, a check he received for the sale of a truck in 2014 \nbounced, resulting in an unanticipated debt. Those were some circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. However, there is insufficient evidence to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(b) because he did not begin addressing his debts until 2018. \nApplicant has not participated in credit counseling, however, his wife is managing \ntheir finances. Based on his resolution of a car loan in 2018, five debts in 2021, and two \ndebts that he began addressing through payment plans soon after they became \ndelinquent in early 2022, there is evidence that his debts are coming under control. To \ndate, he has resolved $13,636 of his debt and is resolving his recent debt of $5,300. The \nevidence establishes some mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). \nApplicant intends to pay the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a when he is able to locate it. He \nwould like to pursue criminal charges against the service member who stole his truck, but \nhas been unable to find him, and he has not made an arrangement to resolve the debt \nwith the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n             \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________ \nApplicant is a 33-year-old soldier, who served on active duty in the Army from 2008 \nto 2017. He then transferred to the National Guard, where he continues to serve as a staff \nsergeant. He has been working for a defense contractor since November 2017, over four \nyears. His wife also served in the Army and now attends nursing school. Their financial \nproblems increased after they left military service in March 2017 and Applicant became \nthe sole provider. \nApplicant made sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. He paid and \nresolved eight of the ten alleged SOR debts, and is resolving two debts that became \ndelinquent in early 2022. He intends to resolve the large NF automobile loan when he \nlocates the current creditor. He would like to file criminal charges against the soldier who \nstole his truck, however, he is aware he remains responsible for the debt. His outstanding \nfour debts total approximately $33,000, of which he is resolving two that total about \n$5,000. After listening to his credible testimony, I have no doubts that he appreciates the \nimportance of financial responsibility and will continue to resolve his outstanding debts \nand monitor his finances with his wife\u2019s assistance. He mitigated the security concerns \nraised under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2006. He served in the military from 1992 to 1996 and was honorably\ndischarged. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2017.

His\nincome has increased incrementally from about $150,000 in 2018 to his present salary.\nApplicant testified that he has held a security clearance since 1992. (Transcript (Tr.) 21-\n26, 56) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his past financial issues to his wife\u2019s gambling problem. He \nbecame aware of it around 2007. She would gamble away her paycheck and then \nwithdraw money from their joint account and gamble that money away. Her problem \ngradually became worse. She would seek help, attend counseling, but then eventually \nresume gambling again. Applicant supported her when she sought professional help for \nher gambling problem. He said that once her problem got out of control he took over the \nfinances, but could not recall exactly when that occurred. He wanted to save his marriage. \nEach time she would be remorseful, and Applicant would accept her commitment to stop \ngambling, but she repeatedly resumed gambling. (Tr. 35, 38, 43-46) \nAfter Applicant and his wife divorced in 2017, they reconciled and remarried in\nNovember 2018. They were living in different states at the time. His wife was getting\nprofessional help. They did not share a bank account. He learned she was gambling\nagain, and they divorced. Applicant stated that his wife\u2019s gambling impacted his finances.\nHis younger daughter was living with his wife and the older daughter moved out with him.\nApplicant provided financial support for his younger child.

Applicant pays the \namount not covered. His older daughter now also receives financial aid for her tuition, \nand Applicant pays her room, board, and incidental expenses. He was paying more for \nher expenses before she began receiving financial aid. He estimated that he now pays \napproximately $5,300 a month for both daughters\u2019 expenses. Applicant is committed to \nensuring his children are cared for and their school expenses are paid. (Tr. 50-54; AE F) \nApplicant has no other income source except what he earns from his employer. \nHe estimated he has about $250-$300 in his checking account and $40 or $50 in his \nsavings account. He has about $13,000 to $14,000 in a 401k pension plan. He estimated \nthat after he pays his daughters\u2019 expenses and his living expenses he has about $1,000 \nto $1,500 remaining in expendable income. He uses that for routine items or providing \nadditional money for his daughters. (Tr. 43, 57-61) \nApplicant purchased a 2017 BMW for $43,000 in May 2020. He withdrew $13,000 \nfrom his 401k pension plan for the down payment. He deferred payment of the taxes and \npenalty on the withdrawal for when he filed his 2020 annual tax return. (Tr. 26-27, 61-64) \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent medical debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($383) and 1.b (643) that \nwere incurred in 2015. In January 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator and was confronted with the debts. In June 2021, after receiving the SOR, \nApplicant began making payments. He has made seven payments and resolved the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. He still owes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and said he is making payments on it. \nThis debt is being resolved. He testified that he was aware of the debts and has no excuse \nfor not paying them as required. (Tr. 37-38, 65-68; AE C, D) \nApplicant incurred a third medical debt in 2018 that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($141). \nHe did not pay the debt until after he received the SOR. He stated he has no excuse for \nhis failure to timely pay this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 67-68; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant purchased a new vehicle in 2015 for $44,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). His payments \nbecame delinquent in 2018 and the vehicle was repossessed. He was able to retrieve the \nvehicle after he paid the deficiency. It was repossessed again in 2020, when he did not \nmake the payments. He stated the monthly payments were approximately $1,078. In \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer he said he would contact the creditor and begin making \npayments in June 2021. He did not. In December 2021, he contacted the creditor to \nresolve the debt, but it wanted larger payments than he can afford. He made one payment \nof $100. Applicant does not have an accepted payment plan with the creditor. When \nasked why he delayed in contacting the creditor, he said he just did not do it, but intends \nto do so now. (Tr.68-74; GE 2; AE B). \nApplicant and his wife purchased a home in 2006 for approximately $400,000. \nThey became delinquent on their mortgage payments and the last payment was in \nDecember 2016. Applicant and his eldest child moved from the house in February 2017 \nwhen Applicant separated from his wife. He testified that at some point, the creditor \naccepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Applicant testified that they had a \u201ccash for keys\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagreement with the mortgage company. Applicant\u2019s documents do not reflect this \nagreement. Applicant believes he is not responsible for the deficiency owed for the \nmortgage. Credit reports from August 2017, August 2019, January 2021, and December \n2021, all reflect a past-due amount of $16,997. In May 2017, Applicant received an IRS \nForm 1099-C cancellation of debt from the mortgage company in the amount of $133,503. \nWhen questioned, Applicant stated he did not file this form with his 2017 federal income \nreturn. Post-hearing, Applicant provided an email from the creditor with a portion of a \ndocument reflecting his mortgage. Although it shows the principal as zero, part of the \npage is missing so it is inconclusive to determine if a deficiency balance is owed. Applicant \ndid not provide substantive evidence to conclude he does not owe a deficiency on the \nmortgage. However, the deficiency is likely included in the cancellation of debt issued by \nthe mortgage company. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 35-37; 74-81; Answer to SOR; GE 2, \n4, 5, 6, 7, 8; AE E, G) \nApplicant testified that he and his wife would prepare their tax returns together. \nShe would make payment plans when they were married. There were periods of time\nwhere there was a disconnect between Applicant and his wife on who was managing the\ntaxes. Applicant filed his 2014 federal tax return in September 2015 (balance owed -\n$4,142); 2015 tax return filed June 2017 (balance owed - $2,339); 2016 filed April 2017\n(balance owed - $6,704); 2017 \u2013 extension request granted, filed past extension in May\n2019 (balance owed - $828); 2018 filed month late May 2019 (no balance owed).\nApplicant filed his 2019 federal income tax return in October 2020 (balance owed -\n$1,850). Applicant testified that he probably filed his 2020 federal income tax return late.\nHe noted that he believes he owes a total of about $30,000 in past-due taxes to the IRS.\n(Tr. 33-35, 81-99; GE 2, 3) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that due to his wife\u2019s gambling problem, he would take \nwithdrawals from his 401k pension plan to pay bills and would incur additional tax liabilities \nin certain years. This began in approximately 2011. He would defer paying the taxes on \nthe withdrawals until the end of the year. He was then unable to pay the tax liabilities \nduring those years. Applicant testified that he would make periodic payments to the IRS \nfor his delinquent taxes, but did not have an approved installment agreement with the \nIRS. Applicant\u2019s 2014 tax transcript reflects an installment agreement was established in \nJanuary 2016. Two payments of $1,184 and $777 were made in June 2019. Another \ninstallment agreement was established in September 2019. A payment of $183 was made \nin May 2020. Post-hearing, Applicant provided a document from the IRS reflecting a \nhistory of tax payments. It shows he made three payments in 2017 for tax year 2011; one \npayment in 2020 and one payment in 2021 for tax year 2012; two payments in 2019 and \ntwo payments in 2020 for tax year 2014; one payment in 2020 for tax year 2015; three \npayments in 2020 and one payment in 2021 for tax year 2016; two payments in 2020 and \none payment in 2021 for tax year 2017; and one payment in 2020 for tax year 2020. (Tr. \n27-35, 41-43, 90-99; AE J; GE 2, 3) \nIn May 2020, Applicant completed government interrogatories. In them he said he \nowed the IRS approximately $33,298 in delinquent taxes. In November 2020, he \ncompleted another set of government interrogatories.

He further said that he asked an \nIRS agent to verify the status of his monthly payments, which were $408 a month, and he \nsaid he was advised by the agent that his payment plan was current. (GE 2, 3) \nApplicant provided a March 2021 letter from the IRS responding to his \ncorrespondence from October 2020. It confirmed that he had requested an installment \nagreement in October 2020, and the IRS declined because the amount he proposed was \ninsufficient to create a full pay installment agreement based on the balance he owed for \ntax years 2011-2017, and 2019. The IRS would accept a monthly payment of $297. This \nletter contradicts Applicant\u2019s statements in his interrogatories that he was making monthly \npayments of $408 on an established payment plan. The history of payments document \nthat Applicant provided from the IRS does not reflect consistent monthly payments as part \nof a plan. None of the payments made were for $408. Applicant completed the installment \nagreement form provided by the IRS in May 2021, in which he indicated that he owed \n$30,400 for the previously noted tax years. (Tr. 91-99; Answer to the SOR; AE J) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he attributed his delinquent taxes to his marital \nissues and the financial stress placed on his family due to his wife\u2019s gambling. He stated: \nI\u2019ve always intended to pay my taxes. Due to overwhelming financial issues \nwe were on a payment plan. We were scheduled to pay $408 a month; \nrecently after this I made an inquiry about my taxes. The IRS sent me a new \namount due which is $294 dollars a month. I set up auto payments to pay \nevery month. The auto pay will help me be consistent with my payments. \nPrior to this I have been making some of my half of the payments of around \n$200 month. Adjusting to taking care of my daughters led to some \ninconsistencies with some payments being on time in the past. (Answer to \nSOR) \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing email, he stated that he contacted the IRS after his \nhearing and was advised that his payment plan would not start until after his 2020 tax \nreturns are processed. There is a delay due to the pandemic. Applicant provided a \ndocument to show he made a $300 payment to the IRS in December 2021, and he intends \nto continue to make a monthly payment until the automatic withdrawal begins. He also \nstated that his 2020 tax liability is approximately $35,000 because he received a \nrelocation package and a bonus. (AE I, K) \nIn July 2017, Applicant completed an electronic Questionnaire for Investigation \nProcessing (e-QIP).

It was never my \nintention to falsify documents about my financial record - Taxes in the past \nseven (7) years. I have filled out a few e-QIP since 2017 and have answered \nyes to taxes owed. I fully understand even if I deliberately answer no to that \nquestion you can\u2019t hide this information. I made a mistake and didn\u2019t include \nmy brother on a previous e-QIP. This is another example of an oversight \nand not intentionally hiding my brother who\u2019s mentioned on all of my e-QIP. \n(Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified that his failure to disclose his delinquent tax filings and payments \nwas a mistake and not intentional. A copy of his January 2020 e-QIP was produced by \nthe Government and admitted into evidence (GE 9). It reflects he answered \u201cno\u201d that he \ndid not fail to timely file or pay his taxes. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. I find \nhe deliberately failed to disclose that he owed delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2014, \n2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 27-33, 100-113; GE 1, 9) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR including other \ndelinquent tax years, will not be considered for disqualifying purposes. It may be \nconsidered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in a whole person analysis. \nApplicant testified that he has not been responsible in the past, but in the future he \nwill do everything right. He will put things in order and prove he can be responsible. He \nintends to contact the IRS to determine the status of his agreement. He takes these \nmatters seriously, and he is not a threat to national security. He believes he is trustworthy. \n(Tr. 114-115) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015 and 2017 federal income tax returns. I find \nApplicant\u2019s delay in filing his 2014 tax returns was de minimis. He failed to pay his federal \nincome taxes for 2014 through 2017 as required. He accumulated other debts that \nbecame delinquent. Applicant had the resources to pay his taxes, but prioritized paying \nhis daughters\u2019 college expenses. There is sufficient evidence to support the application \nof the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s gambling which he became \naware of in 2007. He eventually divorced her due to her gambling problem, but remarried \nher. He did not make timely adjustments to ensure his accounts were no longer held \njointly for many years after he was aware of her issues. Although the gambling issue was \nbeyond his control, the fact that he did not take affirmative action to protect his finances \nwere within his control. He did not act responsibly in this regard. Applicant said he and \nhis wife prepared their tax returns together, and she would arrange payment plans. I did \nnot find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. Even after he and his wife divorced, he continued \nto fail to timely address his tax issues. His budget reflects that he is expending \napproximately $5,300 a month on his daughters\u2019 tuition, room, board, and other \nexpenses, but has made inconsistent payments to resolve his years of tax liabilities. He \nwould withdraw money from his pension plan to pay expenses or purchase a vehicle, \ndeferred paying the tax liability and then failed to do so. It may be commendable that he \nis financing his daughters\u2019 education, but he has done it while ignoring his responsibility \nto pay his other delinquent debts and his legal obligation to pay his taxes. AG \u00b6 20(b) has \nminimal application. \nApplicant\u2019s recent installment agreement application with the IRS was signed in \nMay 2021. It includes tax years 2011 through 2017, and 2019. His post-hearing \nstatements reflected the IRS was still processing his 2020 tax return. It is unknown if this \nagreement will be accepted once the return is processed, considering he stated he \nbelieved he had a $35,000 tax debt for 2020 due to a bonus and relocation allowance. \nApplicant\u2019s recent payment of $300 toward his tax debt and his sporadic payments made \nin the past do not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his tax debt. Based on his years \nof inaction in addressing his medical debts and other debts, his conduct raises issues \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Under the circumstances I \ncannot conclude it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence he has received financial counseling. There is evidence that \nApplicant has corresponded with the IRS and has applied for an installment agreement. \nHe has made one payment of $300 in anticipation that the agreement will be accepted. \nApplicant does not have a reliable track record of complying with paying his taxes. At this \njuncture, he does not yet have an approved agreement with the IRS or shown that he is \nin compliance with an approved agreement. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies to the tax returns that have now been filed, but does not apply to Applicant\u2019s \nunpaid taxes. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debts Applicant has resolved. (Tr. 65) \nAlthough it is likely that Applicant does not have any further legal obligation \nregarding his foreclosed mortgage, it is a concern, based on his testimony that he failed \nto file the IRS 1099-C cancellation of debt form with his 2017 tax return, which likely will \nresult in an additional tax liability. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI have considered all of the evidence and conclude that Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose on his 2017 e-QIP that he did not timely file his federal income tax return for \ntax years 2015 and 2017, and he failed to pay his federal income taxes for 2014 through \n2017. I did not find his explanations credible. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that the government would be able to find out on its own \nthat he had not timely filed or paid his taxes so why would he lie is unpersuasive. The \ngovernment relies on those having access to sensitive and classified material to self-\nreport information. Applicant\u2019s claim that he disclosed his tax issues in other e-QIPs was \nrefuted when his 2020 e-QIP was produced showing he failed to disclose the information \nin it. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission is not minor and based on his testimony, I cannot \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfind that it is unlikely to recur. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness \nand good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns and also failed to pay \nhis federal income taxes for several years. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  1  \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his federal income taxes and pay his delinquent debts, along with his \ndeliberate failure to disclose his tax issues on his e-QIP raise serious concerns. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \n1 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant owed $332,265 for 20 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.p and 1.r \u2013 1.u). Also alleged was a mortgage in foreclosure with a $276,088 balance due. The debts at SOR 1.a, 1.g, 1.t \u2013 1.u are for unpaid medical services totaling $19,099. In response, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the SOR allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since January 2018. She worked for federal contractors between 2002 and 2006, then was self- employed until 2017 as the owner of a small defense contractor, which she ran with her 2 I then-husband. Applicant served as an enlisted member of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) between 1993 and 2008, when she was honorably discharged. Applicant has a solid reputation with her employer and with their government customer. She is regarded as a hard worker and a productive member of the contract team to which she is assigned, and she volunteers at her church in her spare time. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX D \u2013 G; Tr. 42 \u2013 43) Applicant was married between 2000 and 2002.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not, as required by \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, \nas amended (Directive), Section 4.2, make an affirmative determination that it is clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to continue to have access \nto classified information. \nOn September 3, 2020, the DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative \nguideline for financial considerations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR is one \nof the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on October 25, 2021, and I scheduled a hearing to be convened \nvia video teleconference on February 1, 2022. The parties appeared as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 7. Department Counsel also \nprovided a list of exhibits and a discovery letter that are included in the record as Hearing \nExhibits (HX) 1. \nApplicant testified and produced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 C. I held the record \nopen after the hearing so Applicant could submit additional relevant information. \nreceived a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 8, 2022. The record closed on \nFebruary 18, 2022, when I received and admitted AX D \u2013 I. \nProcedural Issues \nThe allegation at SOR 1.l alleged that Applicant owes $46,165 for a delinquent car \npurchase loan. At hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR 1.l to reflect an \nactual balance due of $9,970. Without objection, I granted the Government\u2019s motion \npursuant to Directive, E3.1.17. \nDepartment Counsel also introduced a Pre-Foreclosure Report as GX 7. After \nsome discussion, Department Counsel withdrew the exhibit. It is included in the record; \nhowever, I have not considered its contents. (Tr. 27 \u2013 28) \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant owed $332,265 for 20 delinquent or \npast-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.p and 1.r \u2013 1.u). Also alleged was a mortgage in foreclosure \nwith a $276,088 balance due. The debts at SOR 1.a, 1.g, 1.t \u2013 1.u are for unpaid medical \nservices totaling $19,099. In response, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the \nSOR allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nI make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since January \n2018. She worked for federal contractors between 2002 and 2006, then was self-\nemployed until 2017 as the owner of a small defense contractor, which she ran with her \n2 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthen-husband. Applicant served as an enlisted member of the United States Marine Corps \n(USMC) between 1993 and 2008, when she was honorably discharged. Applicant has a \nsolid reputation with her employer and with their government customer. She is regarded \nas a hard worker and a productive member of the contract team to which she is assigned, \nand she volunteers at her church in her spare time. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX D \u2013 G; Tr. 42 \n\u2013 43) \nApplicant was married between 2000 and 2002. She has a 21-year-old child from \nthat marriage whom she has raised without financial assistance and for whom she has \npaid college tuition. Applicant remarried in August 2002 but divorced in August 2020. It \nwas with her second husband that she ran her small business. They have two children \nwhom Applicant is raising with little or no financial support from their father. (GX 1; GX 2; \nAX K; Tr. 37 \u2013 38, 54) \nThe SOR allegations are supported by her disclosures of financial problems in her \ne-QIP (GX 1) and by credit reports obtained as part of the ensuing background \ninvestigation and adjudication. (GX 3 \u2013 6). Applicant discussed the debts alleged during \npersonal subject interviews conducted on August 8 and 15, 2019 (GX 2), and she \nadmitted to all of the SOR allegations (Answer). At the outset, Department Counsel \nconceded that the debts at SOR 1.b, 1.i, and 1.j had been resolved. (AX B; AX C; AX I; \nTr. 14 \u2013 15) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to a business downturn in late 2016 and \nher divorce in 2020. As to her business, her company worked as a subcontractor on a \nproject for which a much larger company was the prime contractor. When that company \nlost the contract, Applicant\u2019s company was unsuccessful in its bidding to continue working \non the next contract, and she had to look elsewhere for new business. Thereafter, \nApplicant and her ex-husband had mixed success generating revenue for their company. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband also became less involved in the company so that he could \npursue unrelated personal interests. Applicant took her current job in 2018 because \nincome from her company no longer could support their family. She also took a part-time \njob starting to make ends meet in late 2017. Additionally, unexpected medical problems \nadversely affected her finances when she had unplanned surgeries in March 2017 and \nMarch 2018. Even though she had medical insurance, her deductibles were high and \nposed unexpected expenses she struggled to pay. Applicant and her ex-husband began \ndivorce proceedings in late 2019. The legal expenses of a contentious divorce, as well as \nhis lack of financial support also have hurt her finances. Further contributing to her \nfinancial problems has been her commitment to pay college tuition for the child of her first \nmarriage, whose father has not supported in that regard. That child will graduate in the \nspring of 2022. Applicant\u2019s second husband was unemployed when they divorced and \nwas ordered to pay only $250 a month to augment medical insurance for her younger \nchildren. (GX 1; GX 2; AX F; Tr. 47 \u2013 53) \nApplicant started her small business in State A. In August 2005, she and her ex-\nhusband bought a house there.

In \n2007, they bought a home in State B to be closer to the largest of her company\u2019s \ncustomers. When they moved, they had difficulty selling the house in State A due to a \nweak housing market. They had sporadic success renting it while it was listed for sale, \nand they eventually resolved the SOR 1.q mortgage in 2019 by selling it for far less than \nthe total balances owed on the three related mortgages. Available information shows that \nboth accounts are still outstanding as either foreclosures or as charge-offs of the \ndeficiency due after sale of the house. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3 \u2013 6; AX B; Tr. 75 \u2013 89) \nIn February 2007, Applicant and her ex-husband paid $500,000 for their first house \nin State B. The mortgage debts at SOR 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o are equity loans associated with \nthis property. In May 2012, Applicant and her ex-husband bought and moved into another \nhouse in State B. Because the housing market continued to underperform, they again \nhad difficulty selling the first house, again having mixed success renting the property while \nit was listed for sale. The primary mortgage of $400,000 was foreclosed in December \n2017. One of the equity loans, either SOR 1.m or 1.o, was used to pay the remaining \n$100,000 for the purchase price. The SOR 1.k loan was used to finance installation of a \npool soon after Applicant and her ex-husband moved in. The foreclosed first mortgage \nwas not addressed in the SOR. The debts at SOR 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o remain unresolved. \nThey are joint liabilities which Applicant believes her ex-husband should help resolve. \nShe reports that he will not respond to her requests to do so. Applicant is unable to pay \nanything meaningful toward these debts and is waiting for them to fall off her credit history \nby 2025, when the seven-year reporting period under the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n(FRCA) expires. (GX 2 \u2013 6; AX B; Tr. 68 \u2013 80) \nApplicant and her ex-husband bought the second State B house for $875,000. The \nmortgage debt alleged at SOR 1.i represents the primary mortgage for that purchase. \nApplicant and her ex-husband made their last payment on that mortgage in May 2018. \nApplicant and her ex-husband lived together in the house from the time divorce \nproceedings were initiated in 2019 until they sold the house in April 2020. This sale \nsatisfied the mortgage at SOR 1.i. Applicant acknowledges that the decision to move in \n2012 was purely discretionary, and in hindsight, that it was a poor decision by her and \nher ex-husband. (GX 1 \u2013 6; AX B; AX I; Tr. 60 \u2013 68, 104 \u2013 105) \nThe debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.g, 1.t and 1.u are for unpaid medical bills. As \nnoted above, Applicant underwent emergency surgery in 2017 and in 2018. Although she \nhad medical insurance, she estimates the deductible for each procedure was as high as \n$5,000. In addition to information showing she has paid the debt at SOR 1.b, Applicant \naverred that her remaining medical bills totaled $12,839 and were owed to a single \nmedical creditor not specified in the SOR. The debt at SOR 1.h is for a delinquent credit \ncard account totaling $21,345. Applicant used the card to cover expenses when her \nbusiness started failing and her ex-husband was out of work. Applicant had another \ndelinquent card for $6,597 with the same creditor. The creditor apparently agreed to \n$12,986 in satisfaction of those debts.

(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 6; \nAX B; AX C; AX I; Tr. 55 \u2013 60, 81 \u2013 84) \nThe net proceeds from the April 2020 sale of Applicant\u2019s house provided Applicant \nand her ex-husband with $135,230, which they split evenly through their divorce. \nApplicant used her share ($67,615) to buy a car because her\u2019s had been repossessed in \nOctober 2018, as addressed at SOR 1.l. Applicant has also used this money to pay her \ndivorce-related legal fees and to pay college tuition for her oldest child. She paid the \n$2,508 debt alleged at SOR 1.j and began addressing smaller medical and other debts \nof which she was aware at the time. The SOR 1.l debt for $9,970 (amended from $46,165) \nis for the remainder after resale of a repossessed car. Applicant chose to pay other debts \nand to support her son\u2019s education, while allowing this debt to drop from her credit history \nafter seven years in 2024 or 2025. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 6; AX B; AX C; AX I; Tr. 64, 98 \u2013 99) \nThe debts at SOR 1.r and 1.s also remain unresolved. They are delinquent credit \ncard accounts in Applicant\u2019s name, which she avers were used by both her and her ex-\nhusband, and for which she believes he is jointly responsible. She further claimed that \ntheir debts were divided between them in their divorce decree, a copy of which she stated \nshe would provide post-hearing but did not. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 6; AX B; Tr. 94) \nApplicant testified that her current finances are stable, in that, she is able to meet \nall of her regular monthly expenses. She further explained that her decision to let some \nof her debts fall off her credit history after seven years is an acknowledgment that she will \nbe unable to resolve larger debts related to mortgages and repossessions for which her \nex-husband is jointly liable. Nonetheless, she is trying to resolve her more modest debts, \nsuch as her medical bills and retail credit card debts left from her marriage. Applicant also \nhas eschewed credit cards, choosing to live on a cash-only basis. She has cut expenses \nwhere possible, has a second job, and has started saving money, albeit at a modest rate. \nShe has not engaged in any formal credit counseling or financial management assistance, \nchoosing instead to research debt resolution strategies on her own. Applicant insists she \nis doing the best she can to resolve her debts and manage her finances appropriately; \nhowever, she sometimes is hindered by unexpected expenses, such as a recent major \ncar repair. (Answer; AX F; AX H; Tr. 84 - 90) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations \nthat Applicant incurred significant amounts of delinquent or past-due debts, mostly in the \nform of six delinquent mortgage and home equity loans. Available information shows that \nonly one of her mortgage debts (SOR 1.i) has been resolved. Additionally, a debt \nremaining after a car repossession and two credit card delinquencies remain unpaid. This \ninformation reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Appellant still has unresolved debts that arose \nover several years. Accordingly, her financial problems must be viewed as frequent, \nrecent, and ongoing. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nresulted, in large part, from difficulties in the housing market between 2007 and 2017, \nunplanned surgeries in 2017 and 2018, the downturn in her business starting in 2016, \nand from her subsequent divorce in 2020.

She incurred unplanned expenses in the form of legal fees \nfor her divorce, and large deductibles for surgeries in 2017 and 2018, and she receives \nonly nominal financial support from her second husband. \nTo fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b), it must be shown that Applicant acted responsibly given \nthe circumstances with which she was faced. I conclude she has. The mortgage debts \nwere incurred together with her ex-husband and are of such a scale given her income \nsince 2018 that they cannot reasonably be addressed by only one of them. Instead, \nApplicant has focused on resolving her more modest debts to the extent her available \nresources will allow. Most, if not all, of her medical debts are paid, as are two of her \ncommercial credit accounts. She also is faced with the fact that many of her largest debts \nwill no longer be collectible in the next two or three years and has decided to let that \nprocess run its course. Resolving debts in this way, standing alone, is not an acceptable \nmeans of addressing one\u2019s debts. In this case, however, Applicant is simply unable on \nher own to constructively address the mortgage debts, for which her ex-husband is jointly \nresponsible. By contrast, she has paid what she can, cut expenses, taken a second job \nfor extra income, and is meeting all of her current obligations without incurring further \ndebt. I conclude that all of the information probative of this mitigating condition supports \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has not engaged in any credit \ncounseling or other professional financial assistance in resolving her debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies to some of Applicant\u2019s medical debts, which she paid with proceeds from the sale \nof her second State B house, and to her payment of three of her retail credit accounts. \nApplicant still is responsible for a significant amount of debt through her unresolved \nmortgages and one car repossession; however, the analysis under this guideline does \nnot focus solely on the presence of outstanding delinquencies. Despite her financial \nproblems, Applicant has demonstrated good judgment and trustworthiness in resolving \nthose debts that were within her means to pay, and by cutting expenses and avoiding \nadditional debt after her divorce. Available information shows that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur and that she is unlikely to resort to inappropriate conduct \nto generate funds to pay her remaining debts. The concerns raised under this guideline \nare mitigated. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s debts arose from circumstances beyond her control and her \nresponse to those problems reflects positively on her judgment and reliability. Also of note \nis her honorable service in the Marines, the positive information about her job \nperformance from her current employer and government customer, and other positive \ninformation about her character and integrity. The record evidence as a whole supports \na fair and commonsense conclusion in favor of granting her request for continued access \nto classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.u: \n For Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

Since June 2019, Applicant has been self-employed as a contract Truck Driver for a defense contractor. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to three creditors on accounts that were charged off totaling approximately $31,000. In her answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. A credit report of the Applicant dated July 27, 2019, confirms that each of these debts was at one time owing. (Government Exhibit 5.) Applicant attributes her financial difficulties to her divorce in 2014, moving costs she incurred associated with starting over again, and simply not being able to earn enough money to pay off delinquent debts she incurred in the past. She states that her current financial status is improving now that she has a higher paying job. Applicant recently hired a credit counseling service to assist her in resolving her delinquent debt.

Items 1 through 5 will hereinafter be \nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 57 years old. She is divorced, and has three adult children. She has \na high school diploma. Since June 2019, Applicant has been self-employed as a \ncontract Truck Driver for a defense contractor. She is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with her employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to three creditors on accounts that \nwere charged off totaling approximately $31,000. In her answer, Applicant admits each \nof the allegations set forth in the SOR. A credit report of the Applicant dated July 27, \n2019, confirms that each of these debts was at one time owing. (Government Exhibit \n5.) \nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to her divorce in 2014, moving costs \nshe incurred associated with starting over again, and simply not being able to earn \nenough money to pay off delinquent debts she incurred in the past. She states that her \ncurrent financial status is improving now that she has a higher paying job. Applicant \nrecently hired a credit counseling service to assist her in resolving her delinquent debt. \n(See, letter dated August 6, 2020 attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) She is now \nearning higher wages and has stable working hours that allow her to make payments \ntoward resolving her delinquent debt. She is currently working diligently to resolve her \noutstanding accounts. She states that once she has eliminated her delinquent debt, \nshe has no intent to have any financial problems in the future. \nThe SOR lists the following delinquent debts of security concern: \n1.a. \nA delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $11,603. This was a vehicle (Honda) purchased in 2012, by the \nApplicant and her husband during their marriage. They made the payments for several \nyears. \nThey could no longer make the payments and the vehicle was voluntarily \nrepossessed and sold at auction in 2016. The deficiency balance owed is $11,603. \nApplicant has been working with a credit repair company to resolve this delinquent debt. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe provided a letter dated March 29, 2022, from an authorized representative of the \ncreditor, which confirms receipt of Applicant\u2019s final payment of $1,290. This settles the \naccount in full for less than the full balance. (Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM.) \n1.b.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate \namount of $6,671.  This was for a vehicle (Lincoln) purchased by the Applicant and her \nhusband during their marriage.  Her husband was to use the vehicle as a taxi.  At some \npoint, they could no longer afford to make the payments, and it was voluntarily \nrepossessed.  Applicant has been working with a credit repair company to resolve this \ndelinquent debt.  She provided a letter dated March 10, 2022, regarding the settlement \narrangement in place to resolve the debt.  Applicant agreed to pay $1,000.69 by March \n18, 2022, to settle the debt in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM.)      \n1.c.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $12,727.  This debt is regarding the same vehicle discussed in \n1.b., Applicant stated that when she could no longer afford the payments, she requested \na loan refinance.  The creditor refused to refinance the loan, and so Applicant voluntarily \nallowed the car to be repossessed.  The car payments were not delinquent at the time \nApplicant had the car repossessed.  Applicant has been working with a credit repair \ncompany to resolve this delinquent debt.  Applicant provided a letter dated March 22, \n2022, from the law firm representing the creditor, which sets forth the settlement \nagreement in place.  The debt has increased to $18,311.11.  Applicant is required to \nmake regular monthly payments of $1,625, on the 30 of every month starting March 30, \n2022, until the debt is paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM.)        \n  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship brought on by a divorce in 2014 and \ncosts associated with it, as well as her inability to earn sufficient monies to pay her bills. \nHer actions or inactions since then demonstrated a history of not addressing her debt \nand an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant is now earning higher wages and has directed her focus at resolving \nher delinquent debts. \nShe understands the importance of being responsible and \ntrustworthy in every aspect of her life, including her finances. She has been working \nwith a credit repair company and receiving financial counseling to assist in resolving her \ndelinquent debts. She has made remarkable progress toward her goal. She has \ncompletely settled one of the debts in full, she has about $1,000 left to pay toward \nsettling a second debt, and she is making regular monthly payments toward resolving a \nthird debt. Applicant has been working hard to get her delinquent debts in order, and \nhas demonstrated responsibility and good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nMitigating conditions 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are applicable. \n5 \n \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are in the process of been resolved.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant must follow \nthrough with her commitment to pay her delinquent debts, and continue to show \nfinancial responsibility in the future, or she will once again be in jeopardy of losing her \nsecurity clearance and access to classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had outstanding taxes, and past-due indebtedness. He also failed to \nfile two years of tax returns. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has not acted responsibly as to his delinquent taxes, or as to his past-\ndue indebtedness. He waited six years to pay his past-due taxes, and only then by the \nIRS taking his refund. Applicant has submitted nothing showing he has addressed his \npast-due indebtedness. The record has not established mitigation of financial security \nconcerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security \nclearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nguideline for financial considerations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

He attended \ncollege between 2000 and 2003, and again between 2006 and 2019, but did not receive \na degree. Applicant has never been married, and he has no children. \nApplicant work history shows four periods of unemployment, the result of being in \nbetween contracts. He was unemployed between February and August 2009; between \nAugust and November 2010; between April and May 2011; and he was laid off in July \n2017 and unemployed until September 2017.

Except for the above periods of \nunemployment, Applicant has been working for federal contractors since November 2009. \nHe was hired by his current employer and security sponsor, a federal contractor, in April \n2019. He is an Information Technology (IT) systems administrator. (Tr. 23) He is earning \nabout $93,000 a year. (Tr. 29) \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on April \n9, 2019, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his job. He stated \nthat other federal agencies granted him clearances in 2007 and 2009, and that the Office \nof Personnel Management granted him eligibility for a secret clearance in 2009. (GE 1) \nIn his answers to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2019 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed he was delinquent in four accounts including the car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n(surrendered in 2015, and owing $25,733); the credit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \n(delinquent in 2015, and owing $1,152); the delinquent rent alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g (owing \n$5,822 since 2015); and the medical account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (delinquent in 2016, \nand owing $6,425). \nApplicant explained that his financial problems were the result of periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. He works for federal contractors, and he is subject \nto layoffs when the contracts end or his employers fail to renew the contract. He claimed \nhe had been in contact with his creditors trying to establish payment agreements or to \nsettle the accounts. He failed to present documentary evidence to substantiate his claim. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, totaling about $41,000, which include two \ncharged-off consumer credit accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d); and seven collection \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e through 1.i). The remaining SOR allegation, SOR \u00b6 \n1.j, alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2008, which was \ndischarged in April 2009.

Applicant was unable to \nmake the car payments after he was laid off. He claimed he maintained contact with the \ncreditor and made some payments with the help of his mother after he was laid off. \nUltimately, he surrendered the car to the creditor in 2015. Applicant received a \nCancellation of Debt, Form 1099-C, for $23,712, dated December 31, 2021. (AE O) He \nintends to file the document with is 2022 income tax return. (The 1099 is from 2021 so it \nhas to be the 2021 tax return.) He failed to present documentary evidence to substantiate \nhis claim of contacts with the creditor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,425) alleges a medical account in collection. After he was laid off in \n2015, Applicant travelled to another state and was hospitalized and treated for kidney \nstones in 2016. Applicant never made any payments toward this debt. In May 2021, he \ncontacted the creditor and was offered a $4,500 lump-sum settlement. He intends to take \nout a loan to pay off the debt. (Tr. 48-50) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,152) alleges a delinquent credit card in collection. The creditor \nobtained a $1,152 civil judgment against Applicant in September 2017. (GE 7) Applicant \nclaimed he contacted the creditor on an unknown date before he received the February \n2021 SOR, and then again on April 19, 2021, and was offered a $1,000 lump sum \nsettlement. He satisfied the judgment on June 24, 2021. (AE R) He failed to present \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate his claim of contacts with the creditor before April \n2021. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($683) alleges a delinquent credit card in collection. Applicant opened \nthe account in 2013-2014 and it became delinquent when he lost his job around 2015. He \nclaimed he sporadically contacted his creditors telephonically trying to settle his \ndelinquent accounts. He claimed he contacted the creditor before he received the SOR \nand made a settlement offer. The creditor agreed to settle the account for $480. Applicant \nsettled the account for less than owed and paid $480 on April 1, 2021. (AE B, AE T) He \nfailed to present documentary evidence to substantiate his claim of contacts with the \ncreditor before April 2021. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($444) alleges a charged-off credit card account. Applicant opened the \naccount in 2013-2014, and it became delinquent in late 2014. He contacted the creditor \nafter he received the SOR and made a settlement offer. The creditor agreed to settle the \naccount for $312. Applicant paid the account on March 29, 2021. (AE A, AE N) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($370) alleges a medical account in collection. After he was laid off in \n2015, Applicant travelled to another state and was hospitalized and treated for kidney \nstones in 2016. The debt is for emergency services he received. Applicant never made \nany payments toward this debt. He paid the debt after it was charged-off in October 2020. \n(Tr. 62-64; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($5,822) alleges a delinquent lease in collection.

(Tr. 69-70) He presented no \ndocumentary evidence of his contacts with the creditor or of other efforts to resolve the \ndebt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($448) alleges a medical account in collection. After he was laid off in \n2015, Applicant travelled to another state looking for employment and was hospitalized \nand treated for kidney stones in 2016. He believes the debt is for medical services he \nreceived during that period. Applicant paid the debt after he received the SOR. (Tr. 70-\n71; AE C, I) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($228) alleges a delinquent insurance debt in collection. After he \nsurrendered his car, Applicant failed to pay his car insurance. He contacted the creditor \nand settled the account for less than owed in April 2021. (AE, D, F; Tr. 70, 71) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2008. \nThe bankruptcy was discharged in April 2009. (Tr. 40) Bankruptcy is a legal recourse and \nApplicant was entitled to obtain financial relief and secure a fresh start. A Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge releases individual debtors from personal liability for unsecured \nnonpriority debts and prevents the creditors owed those debts from taking any collection \naction against the debtor. Applicant\u2019s SOR debts were acquired after his bankruptcy \ndischarge in 2009. \nI note that Applicant has student loans for about $50,000, that are currently in \nforbearance and were not alleged in the SOR. On December 22, 2021, the DOE extended \nthe student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes the following \nrelief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments, a 0% interest rate, and \nstopped collections on defaulted loans. The Federal Student Aid began accepting and \nreviewing applications from borrowers seeking loan forgiveness under the Public Service \nLoan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program in the fall of 2017. Applicant presented no evidence \nto show that he had applied for student loan forgiveness. He promised to pay his student \nloans when they become due. \nApplicant believes that circumstances beyond his control prevented him from \naddressing his SOR debts between the time they became delinquent and February 2021, \nwhen the SOR was issued. He averred that his periods of unemployment, \nunderemployment, and illness (kidney stones) adversely affected his ability to pay his \nfinancial obligations. Because of his low yearly income (below or about $63,000), he was \nunable to recover from his financial problems between 2015 and 2019. He averred his \nincome was insufficient to pay for his living expenses, current debts, and his delinquent \ndebts. After he was hired by his current employer in April 2019, Applicant has been \nmaking around $93,000 a year.  \nApplicant believes he has done his best to reestablish himself financially and to \npay off his delinquent debts. He stated that he has taken a loan to pay off the two \nremaining SOR delinquent debts. He believes that his financial situation is good.

Only SOR \u00b6 1.e appears to have been paid before he \nreceived the SOR. He was required to participate in financial counseling when he filed for \nbankruptcy in 2008. He presented no evidence showing that he has participated in any \nrecent financial counseling. \nApplicant averred he has a working budget. (AE U) He stated that he now \nunderstands what he needs to do to get his financial problems corrected and to establish \nhis financial responsibility. Applicant expressed his desire to resolve his financial \nproblems. He now understands the seriousness of having negative information on his \ncredit. He promised to resolve the two remaining delinquent debts in the near future. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The\nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988). \n \n \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information))  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history includes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2009. \nFollowing his bankruptcy discharge, he accrued nine delinquent accounts, totaling about \n$41,000, of which three were charged-off and six were placed for collection. Applicant \npaid or resolved six small debts, totaling $3,325 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f, and 1.h and 1.i). \nHe received a cancellation of debt (Form 1099-C) for the largest charged-off debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a ($25,733)). He claimed to be negotiating settlements or payment agreements with \nthe creditors of the two remaining large debts (SOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,425) and SOR \u00b6 1.g \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n($5,822)), totaling $12,247. These two debts remain unresolved. The record establishes \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about \nthe possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable because Applicant has unresolved ongoing debts that \nhave been delinquent for many years. Applicant claimed circumstances beyond his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol prevented him from addressing his delinquent debts, i.e., periods of \nunemployment and underemployment and a period of illness. \nWhile I accept that Applicant\u2019s financial problems may have been aggravated by \ncircumstances beyond his control, his evidence is insufficient to show that he was \nfinancially responsible under his circumstances. \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since at least 2009. He knew \nor should have known of the periods of unemployment or underemployment in between \ncontracts and should have anticipated and planned for such occasions. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to show his emergency or contingency plans in the event of future \nunderemployment and unemployment. \nApplicant was unemployed seven months in 2009; four months in 2010; two \nmonths in 2011; and three months in 2017. He testified that he was underemployed during \nmost of his periods of unemployment working part-time jobs or \u201cother gigs\u201d. Except for \nthose periods of unemployment, Applicant has been fully employed by federal contractors \nsince November 2009. He has been earning about $93,000 a year since April 2019. \nApplicant presented little documentary evidence of efforts to contact his creditors, \nof payments made, settlements agreements, or payment plans established before he \nreceived the SOR in February 2021. Only SOR \u00b6 1.f appears to have been paid before \nthe SOR was issued. All the other SOR accounts that Applicant paid were paid after the \nSOR was issued. I also note that SOR \u00b6 1.c was paid in June 2021, after a judgment was \nfiled against Applicant in September 2017. \nApplicant received credit for his recent efforts to pay or resolve his delinquent \ndebts after receipt of the SOR. Notwithstanding, I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis evidence is insufficient to explain why he was unable to address his delinquent \naccounts more diligently. Two of the SOR accounts remain unresolved and have been \ndelinquent for many years. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, 51, has been working for federal contractors since at least 2009, while \npossessing eligibility for a clearance. He started the process to pay or resolve most of the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR after receipt of the SOR. He has made a good \nstart to establish his future financial responsibility. Notwithstanding, financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated at this time. He should have been \nmore diligent addressing and resolving his delinquent accounts. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make \ngreater documented progress sooner to resolve the SOR debts. He did not provide \npersuasive documentary evidence showing he made specific and reasonable offers to \nsettle the SOR debts. His lack of documented responsible financial action in regard to \nthese SOR debts for the last five years raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debt, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f, and  \n   1.h-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable \nto find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n The hearing was held as rescheduled.

His two marriages \nended in divorce. (Tr. 24; GE 1 at 24) Applicant\u2019s most recent marriage ended in 2009. \n(GE 2 at 8) Applicant earned an associate degree in 2012. (Tr. 25) He is a veteran of the \nU.S. Army. He served on active duty from 1993 to 2000, and in the Army Reserve from \n2000 to 2005, before returning t o active duty between 2005 and 2009.

He has \nbeen working for his current full-time employer for three years in the field of information \ntechnology. (Tr. 70) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. Per the company\u2019s senior network \nengineer, Applicant \u201chas always shown a desire to lean [sic] and do a good job.\u201d \nMoreover, while working for his employer, Applicant has achieved significant milestones, \nand \u201chas conducted himself professionally . . . \u201c (AE E at 2) Per a coworker, Applicant is \na valued asset to the team whose character is above reproach. (AE E at 1) \nIn February 2007, a female private first class, subordinate to Applicant in rank, \naccused him of sexually assaulting her in the barracks while she was unconscious from \nintoxication. When the episode occurred, Applicant was the assigned supervisor in charge \nof quarters. (Tr. 43) His job was to keep soldiers and property safe. (Tr. 45) Subsequently, \nApplicant was tried by general court-martial and charged with rape, sodomy by force and \nwithout consent, adultery, and dereliction of duty. (AE A) Applicant admitted to having \nsexual relations with the female soldier, but contended that it was consensual and limited \nto oral sex. (Tr. 47) Applicant was found guilty of dereliction of duty, rape, and adultery. \nAs for the sodomy charge, the Army amended it, omitting the phrase, \u201cby forcible [sic] \nand without the consent of the said Private First Class . . . . ,\u201d whereupon Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npleaded guilty to the amended charge. (AE A at 1) On June 12, 2007, Applicant was \nsentenced to nine months of confinement and reduction in rank from E-4 to E-1 for six \nmonths. (GE 10 at 1, 8) After being released from confinement, Applicant was discharged \nhonorably in 2009 and allowed to enlist in the reserves. (AE B) \nIn November 2008, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) determined \nthat Applicant committed the offenses of making a false statement, larceny of government \nfunds, and false claims when he submitted fraudulent documents to the Defense Finance \nand Accounting Service, claiming his dependents were residing in one state when they \nactually lived in another. (GE 7 at 2) He submitted these claims for April 6, 2006 through \nDecember 20, 2007. (GE 7 at 2) According to the investigation, Applicant\u2019s actions \nallowed him to receive approximately $18,126 in unauthorized pay and allowances. (GE \n7 at 2) Applicant denied this allegation. He testified that his then wife and child relocated \nfrom the state where they had all been living together in order to live with family members \nin another state. Moreover, per Applicant, when he proved to the relevant authority that \nhis family members were, in fact, living in another state, the Army concluded that his \nclaims were properly submitted and authorized. (Tr. 75) Applicant provided no proof of \nthis contention. \nWhile on reserve duty in November 2011, Applicant was accused by a female \nsoldier of touching her buttocks without permission. (Answer at 2) A subsequent \ninvestigation substantiated the female soldier\u2019s allegation, leading to Applicant being \ncharged with wrongful sexual contact under the UCMJ. Consequently, Applicant was \nreprimanded. (Answer at 2) \nApplicant characterized his behavior in this instance as \u201ca foolish and inappropriate \nattempt at a joke,\u201d that \u201cwas taken out of context to the extreme.\u201d (Answer at 2) Moreover, \nhe testified that he has not engaged in any sexual misconduct in nearly ten years, and \nthat his past sexual misconduct is not reflective of his current character. (Tr. 89) \nSince 2009, Applicant has incurred $54,000 of delinquent debt. Approximately \n$25,000 of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt is comprised of overdue child support, as alleged \nin subparagraph 3.b. (GE 3 at 2) Applicant began falling behind on child support payments \nshortly after his divorce was finalized in 2009. Applicant contended that he could not afford \nthe payments because they constituted 50 percent of his income. (Tr. 30; GE 2 at 8) He \nfurther contends that he has been satisfying his child support delinquency through a wage \ngarnishment. (Tr. 54) There is no record evidence that Applicant\u2019s wages are being \ngarnished to pay child support. As of July 2021, the past-due balance was $21,741. (GE \n5 at 3) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 3.c is an auto loan totaling $10,374. Applicant \npurchased the vehicle in 2016. Unable to afford it after a contract job abruptly ended, he \nallowed it to be voluntarily repossessed later that same year. He has made no payments \non this delinquency since the repossession. (GE 4 at 3; Tr. 58) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 3.d, and 3.f through 3.h are student loan accounts with overdue \npayment amounts totaling approximately $1,570, and collective balances totaling \napproximately $38,000. In 2017, he obtained a forbearance. (Tr. 59) As of July 2021, \nnone of the accounts were in delinquent status. (GE 5 at 3-5) \nThe delinquency alleged in subparagraph 3.e, totaling $8,944, is the balance due \non a car. As with the car that Applicant purchased in 2017, he fell behind on t he p ayments \nafter an employment contract ended, compelling him to seek voluntary repossession. (Tr. \n32) His current job, which he has held since 2018, is more stable than his previous jobs. \n(Tr. 32) Consequently, Applicant has not experienced any erratic disruptions in pay, like \nhe experienced when contracts ended on previous jobs. Applicant has nevertheless made \nno payments toward the satisfaction of the car delinquency since it was repossessed. (Tr. \n58) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 3.i, totaling $377, is a delinquent insurance bill. \nApplicant contends that he satisfied it several years ago. (Tr. 13) He provided no \ndocumented proof of payment. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 3.j is a collection agent for a phone company, \ntotaling $260. Applicant contends that he satisfied it, but provided no documented proof. \nCurrently, Applicant has approximately $250 deposited in his checking account \nand $250 deposited in a savings account. Although he has not formally received any \nfinancial counseling, he has read a book on financial management. (Tr. 69) \nIn 2006, when Applicant was in the military, the U.S. Army Central Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Facility issued an intent to revoke his access to classified information \nand eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information, alleging financial \nconsiderations security concerns. (GE 9 at 13) Subsequently, Applicant was issued a \nsecurity clearance conditioned upon his compliance with debt repayment arrangements. \n(GE 9 at 10) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; ( 4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at t he time of the conduct; ( 5) the extent t o \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, c\n \noercion, ex\n \nploitation, or \n \n duress; an\n \nd (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or\nsensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of sexually assaulting a subordinate. The egregiousness \nof this offense was compounded by the fact that he was married at the time and was in \ncharge of the base quarters where the assault occurred. Under these circumstances, AG \n\u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature . . .,\u201d and AG \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior . . . \nthat reflects lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d applies. \nNearly ten years have elapsed since Applicant has engaged in any sexual \nmisconduct. Conversely, it is extremely disturbing that nine months of incarceration after \nhis first episode of sexual misconduct did not deter him from committing another act of \nsexual misconduct in 2012. Moreover, I am not persuaded that patting a coworker on the \nbuttocks while at work could under any circumstances be taken out of context, as \nApplicant contends in this case, particularly given the false residency papers he \nsubmitted, as addressed below, which further calls his credibility into question. None of \nthe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) The allegation that Applicant submitted false residency \ndocuments in an attempt to receive unauthorized pay and allowances raises the issue of \nwhether AG \u00b6 16(d)(1) \u201cuntrustworthy . . . behavior . . .  .\u201d applies. Applicant denies this \nallegation, contending that the claims at issue were properly submitted. Applicant \nprovided no documentary evidence supporting this contention. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(d)(1) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual assault of an intoxicated soldier, cross-alleged under Guideline \nE, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(2), \u201cany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate \nbehavior.\u201d Applicant\u2019s false residency claim, together with his sexual misconduct, triggers \nthe application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d Given the \nnature and seriousness of these allegations, I conclude that they continue to raise \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s student loan accounts are no longer in delinquent status, as they are currently \nin forbearance. Consequently, I resolve SOR subparagraphs 3.d, and 3.f through 3.g in \nhis favor.  \nApplicant\u2019s child support obligations remain delinquent in excess of $20,000. The \ndelinquencies stemming from the car repossessions remain outstanding and \nunaddressed. Applicant\u2019s contention that he paid the insurance bill and the phone bill, as \nalleged in subparagraphs 3.i and 3.i, are unsubstantiated. Under these circumstances, \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply, and Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn adjudicating this case, I considered the recurrence of issues that generated \nsecurity concerns. Particularly, Applicant committed another incident of sexual \nmisconduct three years after being convicted of rape, and his financial problems had \npreviously posed a security issue when he was in the military. Upon considering the \nrelevant guidelines in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude that Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns at issue in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n_____________________ \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.f \u2013 3.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.i \u2013 3.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to another administrative judge on November 2, 2021. \nThe case was transferred to me on June 14, 2022. The hearing was held via video-\nteleconference on October 27, 2022. The record was held open until November 28, 2022, \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted additional \ndocuments on that date.

Applicant is a 43-year-old contractor who \nworks overseas. In December 2013, he married a woman who is a citizen of the foreign \ncountry where he resides. His wife works for a foreign company and has never resided in \nthe US. She is not a dual citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. His tax issues began \nwhen he attempted to get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for his wife \nfrom the IRS. The IRS was non-responsive. He even attempted to get an ITIN when he \nwas back in the US visiting family. Applicant believed he could not file his federal income \ntax returns without an ITIN for his wife. He indicated this issue on his November 2018 \nsecurity clearance application. \nDuring his subsequent security clearance background investigation, Applicant was \nadvised to file his federal income tax returns with a single status. Once his wife received \nan ITIN, he could amend the federal income tax returns. (Gov 4 at 6) Applicant pursued \nthis course of action and completed and filed all returns before the SOR was issued. He \nowes no money to the IRS. He has filed all subsequent federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2019, 2020, and 2021. He is current on all of his income tax filings and has no \ndelinquent debts. (AE A - AE D) \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and \nconsidered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. \nI also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that \nhe met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

He has two Bachelor\u2019s degrees. Applicant began work with his current employer in March 2017. He requires access to sensitive personal information in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.) The SOR contained four allegations under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, concerning consumer debts. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR under this paragraph with explanations. Evidence for the existence of the debts set forth in the SOR is found in a credit report of Applicant dated November 16, 2019. (Government Exhibit 3.) The total amount of past-due indebtedness owed by Applicant is alleged to be approximately $34,083. None of the debts appear in two other credit reports submitted by the Government dated April 28, 2021; and May 23, 2022. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.) The debts also do not appear in a credit report dated February 12, 2021, and attached by Applicant to his Answer. Applicant and his second wife divorced in April 2014. The debts in the SOR all date to this marriage. He has consistently stated that his financial difficulties primarily resulted from this marriage and eventual divorce. Applicant stated, and the credit reports in the record show, that he has been consistent in paying his student loans, current automobile loans, credit cards, and child support. ",

The record then closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old and married for the third time. He has two children, one \nof whom is a minor living with his second ex-wife. He has two Bachelor\u2019s degrees. \nApplicant began work with his current employer in March 2017. He requires access to \nsensitive personal information in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit \n1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.) \nThe SOR contained four allegations under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, \nconcerning consumer debts. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR under this \nparagraph with explanations. \nEvidence for the existence of the debts set forth in the SOR is found in a credit \nreport of Applicant dated November 16, 2019. (Government Exhibit 3.) The total amount \nof past-due indebtedness owed by Applicant is alleged to be approximately $34,083. \nNone of the debts appear in two other credit reports submitted by the Government \ndated April 28, 2021; and May 23, 2022. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.) The debts also \ndo not appear in a credit report dated February 12, 2021, and attached by Applicant to \nhis Answer. \nApplicant and his second wife divorced in April 2014. The debts in the SOR all \ndate to this marriage. He has consistently stated that his financial difficulties primarily \nresulted from this marriage and eventual divorce. Applicant stated, and the credit \nreports in the record show, that he has been consistent in paying his student loans, \ncurrent automobile loans, credit cards, and child support. He has been able to buy a \nhouse and an automobile recently. His current financial situation is stable. (Tr. 17-18; \nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 3-4.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \n1.a. Applicant admitted that this automobile loan in the amount of $5,441 had \nbeen charged off. This debt related to an automobile that was retained by his ex-wife at \nthe time of the divorce. She did not maintain the payments and the vehicle was \nrepossessed by the creditor and sold. Applicant testified that he had received a Form \n1099-C from the creditor about this account, but he did not introduce a copy into the \nrecord. He further stated that he did not believe this was an active account that he could \npay. Based on the state of the record, there is insufficient evidence to show that it is \nresolved. (Tr. 20-23.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing a past-due medical debt in the amount of $301. He \nstated that this delinquency was due to his insurance company not paying the bill.

He stated that he believed the debt had been resolved because it was no \nlonger showing as delinquent on his credit reports. Based on the state of the record, \nthere is insufficient evidence to show that this debt has been resolved. (Tr. 26-27.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off credit card debt in the amount \nof approximately $11,563. This debt arose during his marriage to his second wife. He \nstated that the debt had been forgiven by the creditor and a Form 1099-C issued. \nApplicant Exhibit A indicates that a credit card debt in the amount of $11,019 had been \ndischarged and forgiven. He testified that he had paid the resulting taxes. The IRS \ndocument further stated that the banking entity is the same as that set forth in allegation \n1.d, below, which is not that stated in the SOR or Government Exhibit 3 for this \nallegation. However, based on the fact the figures in the credit report and Applicant \nExhibit A are so close, and based on all other evidence in the record, I find that this debt \nhas been resolved. (Tr. 28-31.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off credit card debt in the amount \nof approximately $16,778. This debt also arose during his marriage to his second wife. \nHe stated that the debt had been forgiven by the creditor and a Form 1099-C issued. He \nstated that he had paid the resulting taxes. Applicant Exhibit A indicates that a credit \ncard debt in that amount had been discharged and forgiven. I find that this debt has \nbeen resolved. (Tr. 28-33.) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility for a \npublic trust position, the administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the AGs. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility decision. \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of being unable to fully satisfy all of his debts. The \nevidence raises both trustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe evidence supports application of both of these mitigating conditions in this \ncase. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties occurred several years ago in conjunction with his \ndivorce from his second wife. The two largest debts have been forgiven by the creditor \nor creditors. Applicant was issued a Form 1099-C for them, and he paid the resulting \ntaxes. Such documentation was not provided for allegations 1.a and 1.b. However, \nunder the circumstances of this case, particularly Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and \noutstanding current credit history, the lack documentation is not dispositive in this case. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 (a) and (b) apply. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility for a trustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense \njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person \nconcept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant submitted sufficient \ninformation from which to conclude that his financial obligations are being responsibly \nmanaged and that similar problems are unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \npublic trust position. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant met his burden to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial problems. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive ADP information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 60 years old and has been married to his current wife for twelve years. He was married to his ex-wife from 1982 until 2007, and they have two adult children. He has no ongoing financial support requirements for his ex-wife or children. In 1990, he received an associate degree in industrial electronics. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1980 and served until 1990, when he was honorably discharged as a sergeant (E-5). He has worked for Defense contractors, since July 1990, and he has been with his current employer since 1997. His current job title is lead test engineer. He has held at least a secret-level security clearance since 1981, and held a top-secret security clearance for an unrecalled period when he was in the Marine Corps. (Tr. 10-11, 26-29, 88; GE 1; GE 2; AE A) The SOR alleged that Applicant had eleven delinquent debts totaling $38,365. In his second response to the SOR, he indicated, \u201cI admit\u201d to each of the SOR allegations. However, he claimed he was \u201cmaking payments\u201d toward SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j, and he had \u201cpaid off\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k. Therefore, I am considering his admissions to be de facto denials. He did not submit supporting documentation for these claims. The Amendment to the SOR included three delinquent debts totaling $1,492 and an account that was $13,390 past due on an account with a total balance of $122,191. Additionally, the Amendment alleged that he misused his company\u2019s credit car",

(Tr. 10-11, 26-29, \n88; GE 1; GE 2; AE A) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eleven delinquent debts totaling $38,365. In \nhis second response to the SOR, he indicated, \u201cI admit\u201d to each of the SOR allegations. \nHowever, he claimed he was \u201cmaking payments\u201d toward SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.j, and he had \u201cpaid off\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k.

The Amendment to the SOR included three delinquent debts totaling $1,492 \nand an account that was $13,390 past due on an account with a total balance of $122,191. \nAdditionally, the Amendment alleged that he misused his company\u2019s credit card between \n2015 and 2017. He admitted these five allegations. (SOR; Answer; HE I; HE II; GE 1 at \n46) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2019 SCA, he disclosed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h and \nthree unalleged debts.

He indicated his financial issues were the result \nof his wife\u2019s health issues, and all of the detailed debts were being paid. At the hearing \nhe testified that prior to completing his SCA, he discussed his family finances with his \nwife. She told him that they had some delinquent debts, but she had established payment \narrangements, and the debts were being paid. He was unaware that they had delinquent \ndebts prior to completing the 2019 SCA. He did not investigate the status of his finances \nfurther or confirm that the delinquent debts were being paid, because she told him she \nhad \u201ca handle\u201d on the bills. He continued to trust her with their finances, despite her past \ninability to manage money responsibility, as discussed below. He was also unable to \nmonitor their finances closely due to his frequent work-related travel. (GE 1 at 46-51, Tr. \n30-32, 40-46) \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p, starting in approximately 2015, Applicant used his \ncompany-issued-travel card, at his wife\u2019s request, to pay for personal things they needed \nwhen they were between paychecks. They would pay off the card when he received his \nnext paycheck before the card\u2019s billing cycle. He resorted to using his company card, \nbecause his personal credit cards were \u201cclose to their limit and \u2026 there wasn\u2019t enough \nmoney on the card to put the total amount on the personal card.\u201d He did this more than \nten times, despite knowing it was a violation of his company\u2019s policy, and continued until \nhis misuse was discovered in a company audit.

His time spent overseas is collective, not \nconsecutive. While he is abroad, his wife handles their finances, and according to \nApplicant, she has not handled them well. Despite Applicant\u2019s wife asking him to use his \ncompany-travel card to pay for their household expenses, he was still under the \nimpression that she had a \u201chandle\u201d on their finances.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started due to his wife\u2019s illness and her \nmismanagement of their financial affairs; however, he failed to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly in the intervening years to address his delinquent debts and to establish \ncontrol over their finances. The record lacks evidence of him making proactive payments \ntoward his alleged delinquent debts prior to April 2022. There is evidence that some of \nthe alleged debts were resolved; however, all of the payments were made either just \nbefore or just after the hearing. This does not reflect a good-faith effort to repay or resolve \nhis debts. Additionally, he failed to provide substantiating documentation that the \nremaining debts are being resolved or paid. He made assertions throughout the process \nthat his debts were paid or were being paid, and the documentation demonstrated that \nthese claims were inaccurate or false. According to Appeal Board jurisprudence, \nApplicant is responsible for providing reasonably available corroborating documentation \nto show debt resolution. He did not meet his burden of showing his debts were resolved. \nDue to Applicant and his wife failing to manage their personal finances, he resorted \nto intentionally violating his company\u2019s policy regarding the use of his company credit \ncard. At his wife\u2019s request, between 2015 and 2017, he charged personal expenses to \nhis company card, because he did not have enough credit available on his personal cards. \nHe did this at least ten times, and the behavior only ceased due to a company audit. \nBecause he overextended himself, he engaged in questionable acts to generate funds, \nwhile knowing he was violating his employer\u2019s policy. This conduct does not demonstrate \ngood judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide adequate documentation to demonstrate that he has \nresolved or is resolving his debts as he claimed is sufficient to demonstrate that he has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances to address and resolve his financial \nobligations. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) was not established. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s honorable military service and work overseas. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, he has not demonstrated the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy \nperson. I conclude he did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l \u2013 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o \u2013 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

He married in 2015 and has four children under the age \nof five years. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and master\u2019s degree in 2015.

(Tr. 15-22; GE \n1; AE B, D, E) \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from February 2004 to April 2017. \nHe testified that from 2004 to 2006, while in college, he used marijuana less than ten \ntimes. He used marijuana once in June 2009, while on a camping trip. He did not use \nmarijuana from June 2009 to June 2016. He illegally purchased marijuana one time in \n2016. He cooked this marijuana in brownies to eat. He used marijuana from June 2016 \nto February 2017, about five to seven times, while holding a security clearance. His \nexplanation for using it was he was dealing with anxiety, sleep issues, and a back injury. \nHis doctor had prescribed medication, but he did not like taking the drugs because they \nmade him groggy. He used marijuana as a muscle relaxer. He now infrequently takes a \nprescribed medication for stress, anxiety, and sleep issues that has minimal side effects. \nHe testified the last time he used marijuana was February 2017. (Answer to SOR; GE 4; \nTr. 23-30) \nApplicant used the prescription drugs Adderall and Ritalin from May 2012 to 2019. \nThese drugs were not prescribed to him. He got the drugs from a friend. He was unaware \nthis was inappropriate and was not overly concerned using these drugs. He swapped his \nprescribed Xanax with a friend who had Adderall and Ritalin. He infrequently used it while \nattending college and later night school in 2015, while earning his master\u2019s degree or \nwhen completing a big project to help him be more focused. He estimated he used his \nfriend\u2019s prescription drugs about five or less times and did not take a whole pill. He no \nlonger has contact with this friend since Applicant moved to a new state in 2019 that is a \nlong distance away. His doctor was unaware he was using these drugs. (Tr. 30-32, 40-\n45,48-50; GE 4) \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed his drug use on his security clearance applications \n(SCA) in 2011, 2018, and again in 2020.

He also indicated in writing that he is willing to submit to \nrandom and scheduled drug testing. (Tr. 32-34; GE 1, 2, 3; AE G) \nApplicant fully understands that illegal drug use is inconsistent with holding a \nsecurity clearance. He understands this is regardless of whether he actually has access \nto classified information. (Tr. 35-36, 43) \nAfter the birth of his first child in 2017, Applicant made a conscious decision that \nhe must set an example for his children and illegal drug use was inconsistent with the \nmodel he wanted to represent. He is a different person since becoming a parent. He felt \nit was more important to be honest in disclosing his past drug use than to hide it and \nalthough disclosure was required, it was also the right thing to do. He does not regret \nbeing honest. He admitted he made errors in judgment that are in his past and has thought \nabout the negative impact his past drug use could have on his family and his career. He \nasked for another chance. (Tr. 35-37) \nCharacter witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They described him as honest, \nhonorable, prodigious, forthright, disciplined, and trustworthy. They would never question \nhis integrity. He is a devoted family man and father. He is devoted to his faith and is part \nof a team at his church. His supervisor testified that Applicant is highly respected at work \nfor his attention to detail, and he ensures the project is completed on schedule. All but his \nwife, who testified for him, hold security clearances. All expressed they had no concerns \nabout Applicant holding a security clearance. (Tr. 52-91) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about February 2004 to \nFebruary 2017. He purchased marijuana on one occasion in 2016. After being granted \na security clearance, he used marijuana. Applicant used the prescription drugs Adderall \nand Ritalin from 2012 to at least 2018, without a prescription. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nThe primary concern is that Applicant used drugs while holding a security \nclearance, a serious transgression. Applicant voluntarily disclosed all of his past illegal \ndrugs use in his SCAs, and background interview. His testimony was candid and \nforthcoming. He recognizes his errors in judgment. The defining point in his life was when \nhe had his first child in 2017. He vowed to be a good role model. He understands his \ntransgressions have serious consequences and is committed to leading a drug-free life. \nHe no longer lives near a friend who provided him the prescription drugs. He signed a \nstatement to abstain from all drug involvement acknowledging future involvement may \nresult in revocation of his clearance. The evidence supports that Applicant has been \nleading an exemplary life and performing excellently at work. I do not believe he will use \nillegal drugs or drugs that are not prescribed to him in the future. I have considered all of \nthe evidence and find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress b a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from February 2004 to February \n2017. He illegally purchased marijuana in 2016. He used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. He used prescription drugs that were not prescribed to him from 2012 \nto 2018. The above disqualifying condition applies \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce the vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe drug involvement security concerns discussed above were cross-alleged \nunder the personal conduct security concerns. The same facts and analysis apply. In \naddition, use of drugs while holding a security concern is not a minor offense. I believe \nfuture misuse of drugs is unlikely to recur and he has taken steps to reduce vulnerability, \nexploitation, or duress through his commitment to remain drug-free and moving to a new \nstate. Applicant\u2019s conduct was infrequent and did not appear to be for recreational use. I \nfind there is sufficient evidence to apply the above mitigating conditions.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a dedicated professional who is a devoted family man and father. He \nrecognizes his past use of illegal drugs was inconsistent with being a role model for his \nchildren and was inconsistent with his employment while holding a security clearance. \nHis use of drugs while holding a security clearance is a serious transgression. He has \nabstained from using illegal drugs for more than five years. Based on his honest \ndisclosures in his SCAs, background interview, and testimony, I believe illegal drug use \nis in his past and he will not use illegal drugs or drugs not prescribed in the future. \nAlthough not an excuse, his drug use was not recreational. I find he is worthy of a second \nchance. In my whole-person assessment, I find the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

Access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 15, 2018, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On August 28, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline J. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On May 3, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.

On June 14, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 29, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits into evidence, and \nApplicant did not offer any exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 12, 15-17; GE 1-7) There were no \nobjections and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence.

(Tr. 9) \nCriminal Conduct  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in August 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nimporting cocaine into the United States. (HE 2) In October 2001, she pleaded guilty in \nU.S. district court to importing at least 500 grams of cocaine into the United States. The \ncourt dismissed a charge of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. In January 2002, \nshe was sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release.  \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (HE 3) At the time of the offense, \nshe was 18 years old and earning $7.25 an hour working in a retail establishment. (Tr. \n19-22) A drug distributor promised to pay her $1,500, and in return, she agreed to import \nan illegal drug into the United States. (Tr. 19-21; HE 3) She left the United States and \nwent to Jamaica with the intention of bringing illegal drugs into the United States. (Tr. 19-\n21; HE 3) The drug distributor paid for her travel and vacation expenses for her trip to \nJamaica. (Tr. 23) Authorities discovered about 3.1 pounds of cocaine concealed in her \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuitcase.

(Tr. 21; HE 3) Her probation ended in 2004. (Tr. 21) She described her decision to \nimport cocaine into the United States as na\u00efve and ignorant. (Tr. 25) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges in April 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with the \nfollowing crimes: aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, a 2nd degree felony; \naggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a 3rd  degree felony; and battery. (HE 2) In \nOctober 2012, she pleaded guilty in state court to battery and assault. She received \ndeferred adjudication of both charges with concurrent sentences of 12 months of \nimprisonment and 6 months of probation.  \nApplicant admitted the charges, pleas, and sentence described in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (HE \n3) She was outside a restaurant/night club where her sister worked. (HE 3) A woman \nasked Applicant about whether she was dating someone the woman was also dating. (Tr. \n23, 26) Applicant got into her vehicle, and several women climbed into Applicant\u2019s vehicle. \n(Tr. 24) Applicant exited her vehicle, and a physical altercation between Applicant, her \nsister, and three women occurred. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Applicant\u2019s sister helped Applicant get \nback into her vehicle. Applicant said she was innocent of the charges because of self-\ndefense; however, her attorney advised her to plead guilty because she was a convicted \nfelon. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Her sister went to trial and was acquitted. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Applicant \ncompleted a six-month anger-management class in 2012. (Tr. 27; HE 3)  \nThe police report states: \n[Applicant] intentionally struck the [victim] against her will and in doing so \ncaused harm (abrasions cuts and bruising). [Applicant] used closed fists in \nthe incident. [Applicant] then using a motor vehicle intentionally used the \nvehicle as a deadly weapon driving at and striking the victim with the \nvehicle. [Applicant] then turned the vehicle around and drove the vehicle at \nthe [victim] as she lay on the ground. Victim was pulled out of the path of \n[Applicant\u2019s] vehicle. (GE 5 at 11)   \nApplicant\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview \n(PSI) states Applicant admitted that she bumped the woman when she was backing the \nvehicle.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations. When an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe \nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.

See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nFrom 2001 to December 2016, Applicant was charged with five felonies: \nimportation of cocaine (2001); aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (2011); \naggravated assault with a deadly weapon (2011); public assistance fraud (2019); and \npublic assistance fraud (2019). She pleaded guilty to all five charges or lesser-included \noffenses. She received deferred adjudication for all offenses except importation of \ncocaine; she successfully completed all probation requirements; and she paid court-\nordered restitution. The offenses in 2001 and 2011 are not recent. \nThe public assistance fraud was a continuing offense that occurred in 2015 and \n2016, and the offenses are relatively recent. The offense in 2001 and the offenses \nprosecuted in 2019 had financial components. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant made misleading or false statements in \nher SCA and during her OPM interview. Her claim that she would have received the public \nassistance even if she had accurately reported her income is not credible. This claim was \nrepeated in her SCA, during her OPM interview, and initially at her hearing. The \nrequirement for restitution shows the court believed she needed to repay funds that she \nwrongfully obtained after she provided false income information to the state. \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nAfter careful assessment of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, her criminal conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nCriminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old contracts negotiator employed by a DOD contractor \nsince about 2015. She attended community college, and in 2012, she received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in legal studies and prelaw. She completed one year towards a \nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration and contracts negotiation. She has several \nyears of experience as a quality inspector. She is well educated and intelligent. \nFrom 2001 to December 2016, Applicant was charged with five felonies: \nimportation of cocaine; aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; aggravated assault with \na deadly weapon; public assistance fraud; and public assistance fraud. She pleaded guilty \nto all five charges or lesser-included offenses. She received deferred adjudication for all \noffenses except importation of cocaine, and she successfully completed all probation \nrequirements and paid court-ordered restitution. She only has one felony conviction, and \nthat was for the offense in 2001. The 2011 offense involved minor injuries to the victim. \nThe 2001 and 2011 offenses are not recent. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant submitted false \nincome information to the state and received about $18,278 in benefits for which she was \nnot entitled. She claimed the income information she provided was not material to the \ndecision to pay benefits. The court-ordered restitution of $18,278 is contrary to her claim. \nHer misstatements about the materiality of her false income information shows her failure \nto accept full responsibility for her fraudulent behavior, and it shows a lack of \nrehabilitation. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without any conduct of security concern, and a longer track record of \nbehavior consistent with her obligations, she may be able to demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of her security clearance worthiness. I have carefully applied the law, as set \nforth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Items 3 through \n6 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s Answer included documents that are admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The case was assigned to me on April \n27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 43, has five children, including four who share his last name (ages \n16, 14, 11, and 7 (born January 2015)) and one with a different last name, age 7 (born \nNovember 2014). He was married twice. He divorced his first wife of six years in 2008 \nand his second wife of three years in 2017. (Item 3) \nApplicant served on active duty as an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy from 1999 \nuntil 2010, when he was honorably discharged. His education history was not indicated \nin the record. He has been employed as an avionics technician by the defense contractor \nsponsoring his SCA since July 2019. He was granted a DOD security clearance in 2003 \nduring his military service, and again in 2014 as employee of another defense contractor. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling $46,010, including a $26,388 child \nsupport obligation. In his Answer, Applicant admitted 9 of the 12 alleged debts. His \nadmitted debts totaled $39,698. Each of the SOR allegations were confirmed by \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports, dated September 2019, April 2020, and January 2022. (Items \n4-6) \nApplicant denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($2,696) and SOR \u00b6 1.f ($2,980) \non the basis that his ex-wife was responsible for repaying them. He disputed the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($636) on the basis that he was being wrongfully charged for \nequipment that he returned and for which he received a receipt. He did not proffer any \ncorroborating documents. He asserted that SOR \u00b6 1.a related to his \u201cex-wife\u2019s previous \nrental company.\u201d His credit reports listed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a as a joint account, \nand SOR \u00b6 1.b as an individual account. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant asserted that the medical collection accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \n($119), 1.c ($36), 1.d ($105), 1.i ($1,077), and 1.j ($358) will be paid by his U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits. He explained: \u201cVA provides me \nwith full coverage due to disabilities.\u201d He did not proffer any corroborating documents. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d appeared on all three credit reports in the \nrecord. Those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j only appeared in the 2019 report. The 2022 \nreport also revealed four new medical debts totaling $613 that went to collections after \nthe SOR was issued. (Item 4,5) \nAlthough he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e ($26,388), Applicant claimed that he \u201creceived \ncourt ordered termination\u201d of his child support obligation.

AE B relates to his child support obligation for three \nof the children who share his last name, ages 14, 11, and 7. Their mother is identified as \nApplicant\u2019s second ex-wife. AE B is a document terminating a previous income \nwithholding order. AE A is the related court order. Neither AE A nor B establish that \nApplicant\u2019s child support obligation was terminated. They only evince that an income \nwithholding order previously issued to his employer was terminated. Applicant\u2019s 2022 \ncredit report listed two child support accounts in collection status: the one alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e with a reduced balance of $6,189, and another with a balance of $36,226. Because \nthe $36,226 account was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only in evaluating \nmitigation and the whole person. (AE A, B; Item 6 at 4 and 6) \nApplicant plans to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k and 1.l. With respect to the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, he reported that the \u201cvehicle was repossessed,\u201d without \nproffering a plan to resolve it. Applicant\u2019s credit reports revealed two new loan accounts \nand six new credit-card accounts opened between October 2019 and December 2021, \nand that he financed a home purchase in June 2022 with a VA loan. All of the new \naccounts were reported to be in good standing. The record did not address the reason \nwhy Applicant failed to disclose any of his derogatory financial information on his SCA \nnor was that omission alleged in the SOR. Thus, I will consider it only in evaluating \nmitigation and the whole person. (Item 3 at 43-44; Item 5 at 1, 4; Item 6 at 6-8) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying condition under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Due to a lack of \ninformation in the record, neither AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) nor AG \u00b6 19(b) \n(unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so) are established. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe Government presented a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline \nF. Accordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient information on which \napplication of the mitigating conditions could be based. With the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \nand 1.j, which I find in Applicant\u2019s favor based on the application of AG \u00b6 20(d), he failed \nto do so. Although Applicant raised the potential applicability of the mitigating conditions \ncited above, he produced no corroborating documentation or other sufficient information \nto support the application of any of the mitigating conditions as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.h, 1.k, and 1.l. Accordingly, based on the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence to fully mitigate the Guideline F concerns at \nthis time.  \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson.

The case was assigned to me on August 30, 2021. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on October 13, 2021. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4 were admitted in evidence without objection.

Without objections, I granted the motion. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 32 years old. He served in the Army between 2009 and 2014. He was \nhonorably discharged in 2014 as an E-4 (specialist). He held a secret clearance while in \nthe service. He testified that he is receiving a $2,000 monthly disability pension, because \nof anxiety, depression, and tinnitus. (Tr. 64-65) He married in 2010 and divorced in 2011. \nHe has a nine-year-old daughter for whom he provides court-ordered financial support \n($471 monthly) since 2012.

He was unemployed between March 2017 and October 2017. He fell behind in his \nchild-support payments while unemployed, but claimed he is presently current.

He was hired by his current employer and security sponsor in May 2021. He seeks \neligibility for a security clearance, which is required for him to maintain his employment. \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts, with balances totaling about $40,000. \nApplicant admitted to owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($9,453); 1.b ($8,662); and \n1.d ($6,195). He denied all of the remaining SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e through \n1.l, except 1.g).  \nThe status of the SOR allegations follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($9,453) concerns a car loan. In 2019, he totaled the car in an accident. \nAfter that, he claimed he could not afford to continue making the loan payments for a car \nhe no longer had. He stated he needed to take care of his wife, who was pregnant at the \ntime. As of his hearing date, he had not made written contact with the creditor to settle, \npay, or resolve the debt. He intends to resolve the debt sometime in future. He averred \nthat in 2020, he contacted the creditor asking for a possible settlement. He was asked to \nsubmit his request in writing, and he never did. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($8,662) concerns a car repossession. Applicant purchased a car. In \n2013, he voluntarily surrendered it to the creditor because he could not afford to continue \nmaking the payments. The creditor charged off the debt. The account remains delinquent. \nAfter 2013, he did not contact the creditor to settle, pay, or resolve the debt.

(Tr. 47-48) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($6,195) concerns a delinquent, joint credit-card account that Applicant \nstopped paying in 2015. He has not contacted the creditor to resolve the debt, and the \naccount remains delinquent. (Tr. 48-49) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,463) concerns furniture Applicant claimed his wife purchased \nwithout his knowledge. He claimed not knowing about this account until 2020. The \naccount was charged off in 2017. He testified he contacted the creditor three weeks \nbefore his hearing (after receipt of the SOR) to resolve the debt. He was offered a \nsettlement for about $1,200, but he did not have the financial means to take the offer. The \naccount remains delinquent. (Tr. 49-50) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($50) alleges a delinquent account for communication services that \nApplicant denied and claimed he disputed.

He \nhas not contacted the creditor to resolve the debt, and the account remains delinquent. \n(Tr. 52) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,158) alleges a 2012 delinquent account to a communications \nservices provider that Applicant denied and claimed it was not his account. The debt is \nestablished by the credit reports in evidence. Applicant claimed he had the same \ncommunications services provider until recently, when he exchanged providers, and was \nnot delinquent. He failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate his claim. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($2,828) alleges a delinquent child-support obligation placed for \ncollection. During his hearing, Applicant denied being in arrears or being delinquent in his \nsupport obligation. After the hearing, Applicant submitted documentary evidence from his \nstate\u2019s child support enforcing agency showing his payment record between November \n2018 and November 2021. (AE B) During the period of the report, Applicant was \nsometimes current and other times delinquent. As of November 2021, he was $1,207 in \narrears. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,226) alleges a delinquent account to a communications services \nprovider that Applicant denied and claimed it was not his account.

The credit reports in \nevidence establish it as Applicant\u2019s account and show he stopped making payments on \n2018. \nThe Government questioned Applicant about three delinquent accounts not \nalleged in the SOR. The first is for $217 to a power company. Applicant claimed he paid \nit during the summer of 2017. After the hearing, he submitted documentary evidence \nshowing he paid it on October 25, 2021. The second is a $3,691 debt to a \ntelecommunications services provider. Applicant admitted it was his account and that it \nwas unresolved. (Tr. 59-60) The third is a debt for $594 owed to a communications \nservices provider. The account is unresolved. \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified he did not have a written budget, but claimed he \nwas following a budget. Post-hearing, he submitted a written budget showing a $5,409 \nmonthly income, monthly expenses of $4,395, and $1,000 remainder. (AE A) He \npresented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling. \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment after his discharge from the military, his divorce from his first wife, and \nhis separation from his current wife. With the exception of the garnishment, Applicant \npresented no evidence of any payments made toward the debts alleged in the SOR, until \nafter he was issued the SOR. None of his payments predate his hearing. He stated that \nhe was concentrating on paying the child-support garnishment, providing support for his \nother children, and the loan for his current car. He implied that his income is insufficient \nto pay for his living expenses and delinquent debts. Applicant testified that when he \napproached his creditors seeking a settlement, he was asked for large sums of money \nthat he could not afford. \nApplicant admitted that letting his finances suffer was a careless and an \nirresponsible thing to do. He stated: \nI put myself in a lot of bad positions. I've allowed relationships to take the \nbest of me. I allowed my emotions, as far as being relationships, to take the, \nto get the best of me. I wanted to make sure I took care of my family first  \n. . . . I was just trying to take care of family. Making sure I get them in order. \nPutting things on the back burner, and then, forgetting about it. Not getting \nback to it in time. And then, just I wasn't keeping a budget. I didn't have a \nbudget in order. And I just I allowed myself to get really irresponsible when \nit came to a lot of money things. (Tr. 63) \nApplicant expressed his desire to resolve his financial problems. He stated that he \ntakes his financial problems seriously.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The\nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in\nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one\nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988). \n \n \n \n \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes 11 delinquent debts, unresolved for \nmany years, is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment after his discharge from the military, his divorce from his first wife, and \nhis separation from his current wife. However, several debts became delinquent before \nhis discharge from the military, and others became delinquent after he was fully employed \nwith federal contractors. The only debt that is being paid is through involuntary \ngarnishment of his pay. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nI note that Applicant started the process to establish his financial responsibility, \nalbeit after receipt of the SOR.

Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Consequently, it is too soon to conclude \nthat she has mitigated the financial considerations concern. Also, Applicant failed to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns posed by her delinquent finances and her falsification \nof her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Procession (EQIP). Her application for a \npublic trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 16, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, explaining why it was unable to conclude that Applicant was eligible to \noccupy a public trust position. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).

She \nrequested a decision without a hearing. On June 24, 2021, Department Counsel prepared \na File of Relevant Materials (FORM) setting forth the Government\u2019s argument in support of \nthe SOR, together with supporting documentation. Applicant received a copy of the FORM \non July 6, 2021, and was instructed to file any objections to this information, or to \nsupplement the file within 30 days of receipt. On August 9, 2021, Applicant filed a reply. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 6, 2021.  \nPreliminary Ruling \nThe allegations set forth in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d allege that Applicant owes \ndebts, but do not identify the respective creditors. \u201cTo be legally sufficient, an SOR must \nplace an applicant on reasonable notice of the allegations against him or her so that the \napplicant has a meaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations and prepare a defense \nagainst them.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-17219 (App. Board, Jan. 7, 2005) at 2). SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d do not meet this threshold. Therefore, in light of Applicant\u2019s \ndenials, I resolve subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d in her favor. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old single woman. She graduated from college in 2011 and \nhas been working as a healthcare consultant for various companies since then. (Item 1 at \n5; Item 3 at 5) \nSince finishing college in 2011, Applicant has incurred approximately $50,000 of \ndelinquent debts. Subparagraph 1.a, totaling $185, is a delinquent health club fee. \nApplicant satisfied it on May 4, 2021. (Item 1 at 11) Subparagraph 1.b, totaling $623, is a \ndelinquent car insurance payment. (Item 1 at 6) The delinquent amount is the balance due \nwhen she switched car insurance carriers in September 2019. She switched car insurance \nproviders because she could no longer afford the rate after losing her job in 2019. (Item 3 \nat 9) On May 4, 2021, Applicant contacted the creditor and arranged a payment plan. She \npaid her first installment, totaling $124, that day. (Item 1 at 13) \nSubparagraphs 1.e through 1.g are allegedly delinquent student loans, totaling \napproximately $32,000. Subject originally borrowed $18,000 to $20,000. (Item 3 at 8) She \ndeferred paying these loans for three years. (Item 3 at 8) She was unaware that interest \nwould accrue while the loans were in deferral. In May 2021, Applicant retained a credit \nrepair company to help her set up a payment plan. (Item 1 at 7, 24) She provided no \nevidence of any payments made yet. \nSOR subparagraph 1.h alleges that Applicant failed to file her state income tax \nreturn for 2018. Applicant performed seasonal work in this state, but did not live there. \n(Item 1 at 7) Moreover, she never received a W-2 or W-4 form from the state\u2019s taxing \nauthority, as her employer failed to withhold income taxes from her salary. (Item 1 at 5) In \nearly 2021, the state garnished her wages. Since then, she has been paying $250 per pay \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperiod. (Item 1 at 29) The initial balance was approximately $6,000, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.i. Currently, the balance is $2,000. (Item 1 at 7) \n \nApplicant did not file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 on \ntime, as alleged in subparagraph 1.j. (Item 1 at 7) Moreover, as of the date of the SOR, \nApplicant owed back federal income taxes totaling $3,889 for 2014 (subparagraph 1.k), \n$8,554 for 2015 (subparagraph 1.l), and $13,193 for tax year 2016 (subparagraph 1.m). In \nApril 2021, Applicant paid $1,500 towards her federal income tax deficiency. The IRS \napplied the payment to tax years 2014 through 2016 in equal, $500 amounts. (Item 1 at 32-\n36) On August 3, 2021, Applicant retained a company that assists people with resolving \nincome tax delinquencies.

Previously, all of her work was either temporary or seasonal, and her income was \nsporadic. Between 2014 and 2018, she only worked 40 percent of the year, and between \n2018 and Fall of 2019, she was unemployed. (Item 1 at 5, Item 3 at 5) \nIn January 2018, Applicant went on a tropical vacation out of the country. She took \nanother vacation out of the country in January 2019. (Item 2 at 19-20) \n \nSection 26 of the EQIP requests applicants to disclose whether they have had any \naccounts or credit cards turned over to a collection agency, suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled for failing to pay as agreed. (Item 2 at 27) SOR subparagraph 2.a alleges that \nApplicant falsified this section because she did not list the debts alleged in subparagraphs \n1.a through 1.d. When Applicant completed the SOR, she was aware that both \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b were delinquent, but did not know that they had been turned \nover to collection agencies. (Item 1 at 8-9) \nSection 26 of the EQIP also requires applicants to disclose current federal \ndelinquencies, whether they have ever been delinquent on federal or state delinquencies in \nthe past seven years, or whether they have failed to file any federal or state income tax \nreturn. (Item 2 at 27) Applicant did not include her delinquent federal student loans, as \nrequired. During her subject interview, she admitted taking out several student loans in \n2012 and being subsequently unable to satisfy them because of employment instability. \n(Item 3 at 7) In her answer, she stated that they were \u201cnot factual debts.\u201d (Item 1 at 9) \nApplicant did not include her state income tax delinquencies on her EQIP. At the \nbeginning of Applicant\u2019s subject interview, she volunteered that she had not paid state \ntaxes for 2017 and 2018. (Item 3 at 7) She did not mention her federal income tax \ndelinquency. She contends that she did not include the federal tax delinquencies because \nshe was unaware they had been turned over to a collection agency.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coerion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 \n18, as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . .. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant did not live in the state where she worked. Her employer neither withheld \nmoney from the state she lived, nor withheld state income taxes from the state where she \nworked. Consequently, although she is responsible for the delinquent state tax debt, her \nfailure to file state income tax returns has no negative security consequences. I resolve \nsubparagraph 1.h in her favor. \nNevertheless, Applicant is responsible for the delinquent state tax debts. These \ndebts, together with the other debts in the SOR, generate security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Her failure to file her tax years 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns, and \nher federal and state income tax delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure \nto file, or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns, or failure to \npay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved, or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was unable to keep current with her debts because she was either \nunderemployed or unemployed for much of the period between 2014 and 2019. Now that \nshe is fully employed, she has satisfied subparagraph 1.a, and has been satisfying her car \ninsurance delinquency, and her income tax delinquencies through payment plans. In \naddition, she has contacted a credit counseling company to assist in resolving the \nremaining debts. Conversely, she took two vacations out of the country between 2018 and \n2019. Given her financial problems, this was not responsible. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies, but has limited probative value. \nApplicant\u2019s work with the credit counseling company and her initiation of payment \nplans triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). The arrangements she initiated to satisfy her \nincome tax delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(g). \nAlthough Applicant has retained a credit repair company, and has begun making \nplans towards the resolution of her delinquencies, her progress is minimal in relation to the \namount due. Moreover, she has yet to begin making payments towards the resolution of \nher student loans. Under these circumstances, although Applicant has made some \nprogress, it is insufficient to conclude that she has mitigated the trustworthiness concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\" (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful or candid answers during security investigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s responses on Section 26 of the EQIP raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 \n16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \nApplicant was aware that she was delinquent on the bills set forth in subparagraphs 1.a \nand 1.b, but was unaware that they had been turned over to credit collection agencies. \nApplicant was unaware of the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, and the \ncreditors remain unidentified. I conclude that Applicant did not falsify subparagraph 2.a, \nand did not intend to conceal these accounts during her subject interview in 2019, as \nalleged in subparagraph 2.d. \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s subject interview, she admitted taking out several student loans in \n2012 and being subsequently unable to satisfy them because of employment instability. In \nresponse to SOR subparagraph 2.b, which alleged that she deliberately omitted them from \nher EQIP, Applicant replied that the student loans were invalid. Given the conflicting \nexplanations about the student loans, I conclude that her omission was an intentional \nfalsification. \nAlthough Applicant did not list her state tax delinquencies on the EQIP, she \nvolunteered them to the investigator before being confronted at her interview. AG \u00b6 17(a), \n\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d applies. I conclude that the omission of \nthe state tax delinquencies and her failure to note that she had not filed them on time do \nnot constitute intentional falsifications. \n \nThe EQIP unequivocally requires applicants to include any failure to file or pay \ntaxes. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s contention that she did not include her federal \ndelinquencies on the EQIP because they had not been referred to a collection agent is not \ncredible. I conclude that her failure to list her federal income tax delinquencies on her EQIP \nwas an intentional omission. \nIn sum, given the intentional omissions, as alleged in subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct trustworthiness. concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and they do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to public \ntrust information.

After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. She has been married since 2006 and has two children \nwho are 16 and 14 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2014. She is a prospective employee for a federal contractor. (Transcript (Tr.) \n14-17; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges two student loans debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$45,694 and 1.b-$119,570). \nApplicant testified that she attended an out-of-state college from 1994 to 1998. Her \nparents took out loans to pay some of her college expenses, and she took out student \nloans in her own name. She was not certain of the exact amount of her original loans, but \nestimated the total was likely $60,000. Applicant took college courses from a private \ncollege from 1999 to 2002, while working full time. Her undergraduate student loans were \ndeferred during this time. She used student loans to fund her graduate education and she \nestimated the amount of those loans to be around $60,000. She did not earn a degree \nfrom this school. (Tr. 25; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant testified that when she left school in 2002 she was supposed to start \nrepaying her student loans. She said she paid $100 a month until about 2006 when she \nmarried. She said sometime after 2006 the owner of the loan changed, and she did not \nknow who to pay. She testified that at some point, she began paying again. It is unclear \nwhen the loans became delinquent again. She did not provide any documents to \ncorroborate her testimony. (Tr. 25, 30-32) \nApplicant began attending online college classes through a private university from \n2011 to 2014. She testified that her student loans were deferred during this period. She \nalso was able to get a small loan of about $3,000, through the GI Bill, because her \nhusband was on active duty in the military. She received her master\u2019s degree in 2014. \nShe contacted the creditor and learned she owed a lot more than she thought. She has \nnot made any payments on any of her student loans since graduating in 2014. (Tr. 14-15, \n25-26, 32-33) \nIn 2013, Applicant founded a non-profit organization. She had a detailed business \nplan, but it technically did not launch until about 2015. She voluntarily left her job in 2015 \nto run the non-profit. She had a partner. Applicant invested a small amount of her own \nmoney into the business, but the bulk of the operating and funding was to come from \ngovernment grants. She anticipated it would be three years before she was earning an \nincome. She estimated that both her and her partner would each earn about $90,000. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFrom 2015 to 2016, Applicant was not earning any income. The business account has a \ncurrent balance of about $7,000 to $8,000. When asked how she intended to make \nstudent loan payments during the three years she did not anticipate earning an income, \nshe said she had not factored that expense into her planning. (Tr. 19-24, 33-37) \nApplicant went back to work in December 2016. She changed jobs in the later part \nof 2019 and was then laid off in March or May 2020 due to the pandemic. She was earning \nabout $24,000 annually in her new position. She was unable to make student loan \npayments. He wages were garnished by the Department of Education. She contacted the \ncreditor and was advised that she could apply for an income based repayment plan. By \nthe time she received the application form, the pandemic had begun and student loans \nwere put in a deferred status. She has not contacted the creditor since the loans were \ndeferred. She hopes to participate in a payment plan after the deferment ends. (Tr. 17-\n19, 24, 37-42) \nApplicant did not recall making any voluntary payments on her student loans since \n2011. Applicant has no idea how she will repay her student loans. She has no savings. \nHer family\u2019s annual income is about $65,000. She is conscientious in how her family \nspends their money. She credibly testified that when she was 18 years old she wanted to \nattend a certain school and did not consider how expensive it was. When she graduated, \nshe was shocked at how much the monthly amount was to repay her student loans. Then \nshe attended another college that was also expensive, but again did not think about the \nfinancial impact. She thought with a master\u2019s degree her earning potential would allow \nher to repay the loans because she would earn more money. By the time she realized the \nfinancial impact, she was between 35 and 40 years old and had about $160,000 of student \nloan debt. She attempted to get a better paying job with a federal contractor, but is having \ndifficulty meeting its qualifications. She is hoping if she can get a better paying job, she \ncan pay her student loans. (Tr. 41-47) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were in a delinquent status for many years before they \nwere deferred due to the pandemic. They are unresolved. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=-'s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant testified that she made some payments on her student loans, but \nstopped in 2006. She said she resumed paying once she determined the new creditor. \nShe did not provide any corroborating evidence of her payments. She incurred additional \nstudent loans to complete her master\u2019s degree. She has not provided evidence of efforts \nto repay those loans. She left her job to start a non-profit organization and did not earn \nan income. This was a voluntary decision and within her control. When she resumed \nemployment she was underemployed, which may have been beyond her control. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Although Applicant may want to repay her student loans, she has not \nmade tangible efforts to address the loans and does not have the resources to do so. She \ngave up a job to start a nonprofit, but did not factor in her obligation to pay her delinquent \nstudent loans. Her delinquent debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling and there are not clear \nindications that her financial delinquencies are being resolved. Although she may have \nmade some payments on her student loans in the past, she did not provide corroborating \ndocuments for that assertion and admitted that she has not made any payments in recent \nyears. The facts do not support the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant owes an overwhelming amount of student loan debt that she cannot \nafford to pay and she is underemployed. She made significant financial decisions without \nconsidering how she would repay her delinquent student loans. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

His elder son lives with the boy\u2019s \nmother. (Tr. 16 -17) \nConcerning his alcohol consumption, Applicant testified that from about 1988 to \nabout 1992, he consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication. \nFrom about 1993 to about 2008, he rarely consumed alcohol and never to excess or \nintoxication.

During the period of 2014 to June 2017, Applicant went \nthrough what he described was an extremely rough time in his prior marriage, including \na separation that culminated in divorce. During this period, he consumed alcohol at times \nin excess and to the point of intoxication. (SOR answer) \nApplicant attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings with his first AA sponsor \nperiodically between 2014 and July 2020. He had some success with lengthy periods of \nsustained sobriety. He believes he has learned from his mistakes and has not had any \nalcohol since July 2020. (Tr. 18; AE A) He attributes his success abstaining from alcohol \nto attending weekly AA meetings and starting his new AA Big Book Step Study with a \nnew sponsor. His new sponsor has taken him through the 12 Steps of Recovery. He \nconsiders himself a recovered alcoholic and has no intentions of consuming alcohol \nagain. He is committed to making responsible decisions for himself and his family, \nincluding refraining from the use of alcohol. He stated that he is attending AA meetings \nevery week. \nIn October 2014, during his first marriage and prior to his entry into AA, Applicant \nattended a family function and had \u201ca few\u201d drinks of alcohol. On his way home, his child \nfell sleep in the car and he stopped at a store allegedly to buy food, leaving the child alone \nin the car. The police were called and Applicant was arrested and charged with intoxicated \nendangerment/unattended child under eight years old. Applicant expressed remorse for \nhis poor judgment. After the arrest, he attended 12 weeks of alcohol counseling, which \nincluded weekly breathalyzer tests and random urinalysis screenings, and started \nattending AA meetings. (Counselor\u2019s letter of October 2014) The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office \ndismissed the charge and the state expunged the record. Applicant testified that this is \nthe only alcohol-related legal action that he has faced. \nIn November 2018, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependency in partial \nremission, and in December 2018, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Applicant \nexplained that in November 2018, he started to see a new physician who prescribed six \nshots of an alcohol medication to help him maintain sobriety. The new medication was \nhelpful preventing the cravings or his desire to consume alcohol, but it was expensive at \nabout $2,900 per injection. Applicant explained the doctor changed the diagnosis so that \nhis medical insurance would pay for the injections. He received the injections from \nDecember 2018 to June 2019. (GE 3) \nApplicant attributed his success in abstaining from alcohol to his wife\u2019s support. \nShe has been proactive on working with him to learn what is going to keep him sober and \nkeep their relationship in a good spiritual base. He wants to be a good father and husband \nfor his family. (Tr. 21 \u2013 22) \nApplicant submitted an evaluation from his licensed counselor, dated October 7, \n2021.

(AE A, attachments 5a \u2013 5h) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), which became effective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nFrom 1988 to about March 2020, Applicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess \nand to the point of intoxication. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) In October 2014, he was charged with \nintoxicated endangerment/unattended child under eight years old. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) In \nNovember 2018, he was diagnosed with alcohol dependency in partial remission (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), and in December 2018, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are supported by the facts in this case: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress in a treatment program; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is partially established by the evidence. The only alcohol-related legal \nincident happened in 2014, thus, it is not recent. However, Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol \nconsumption occurred in March 2020, and it could be considered recent. Notwithstanding, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) through 23(d) are fully established by the record evidence. The evidence \nshows a significant period has passed without recurrence. Applicant has demonstrated a \npattern of abstinence, he has continued to participate in AA counseling, and is making \nsatisfactory progress. Under the circumstance of this case, Applicant has demonstrated \nchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related problems were caused by a difficult marriage and \nsubsequent divorce. After he was charged in 2014 with intoxicated endangerment of his \nunattended child, he acknowledged his problem and voluntarily sought treatment, which \nhe completed. The source of the stress caused by the deterioration of his marriage \napparently has been resolved by divorce and is unlikely to recur. He is now remarried and \nin a healthy relationship. \nThe testimonials of the coworkers, supervisors, and friends indicate that Applicant \nhas improved his performance and demonstrated a desire to achieve sobriety. He is \nconsidered to be a valued employee who does a great job as a coworker, husband, father, \nand friend. He has made great strides over the past few years, and is in a good place \nprofessionally and personally. Applicant recognizes that he will not receive a second \nchance if he abuses alcohol again. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis \nand considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere, candid, remorseful, and \ncredible at the hearing. He is highly regarded by his colleagues and supervisors, who \nbelieve that he has overcome his alcohol problem and that it will not recur. He has \nvoluntarily sought and received treatment. He loves his family and his desire to be a good \nfather has helped him abstain from alcohol consumption. A licensed alcohol counselor \nopined that he did not appear to have an alcohol problem when she last evaluated him in \nOctober 2021. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline \nG, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nJUAN J.

Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4 Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7 \n1 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \n \n \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nThe evidence before me does not support a conclusion that Applicant has \nengaged in sufficient remedial efforts to justify a favorable clearance decision. She has \nnot presented any documentary evidence in support of her case. Her 13 delinquent \naccounts remain wholly unresolved. None of the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20 \napply here. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she \nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

(TR at page 24 line 12 to page 35 line 1, and GX 1 at \npage 25.) He is divorced, and has two children, ages 26 and 29 years old.

When his \ncompany failed in 2009, Applicant filed for unemployment benefits on behalf of his minor \nchildren, for \u201c99 weeks,\u201d ending in \u201cmid-2011.\u201d (TR at page 32 line 7 to page 35 line 2.) \nHe placed said monies, when received, \u201cinto their bank accounts.\u201d (TR at page 15 lines \n12~25.) \nIn December of 2015, Applicant was charged with two counts of False \nStatement, Representation, or Concealment; two counts of Identity Theft \u2013 Obtain \nCredit with Other\u2019s Identity; and Grand Theft \u2013 all felonies. Applicant denies committing \nthese felonies, but did pled guilty to Failure to Post Benefit Rights in his work place, a \nmisdemeanor. (TR at page 15 line 7 to page 22 line 24, at page 23 line 13 to page 24 \nline 6, and page 37 lines 4~16.) Applicant was ordered to pay $45,000 in restitution; \nwhich he avers has been paid (currently in civil litigation), and was placed on probation \nuntil this month, March of 2022. (TR at page 38 line 4 to page 40 line 6, and GX4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant was convicted of a misdemeanor offense in 2017. He was placed on \nprobation for five years, which ends this month, March of 2022. The evidence \nestablishes the above three disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nMore than ten years have passed since the Applicant\u2019s alleged felonious \nconduct, and his admitted misdemeanor conduct. Within the month of this writing, his \nprobation is ending. He provided evidence of successful work with his employer. (AppXs \nB~D.) The evidence does establish mitigation under the above conditions. Criminal \nConduct is found for Applicant \nWhole-Person Concept \n4 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppXs B~H.) Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Criminal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He did not answer SOR \u00b6 2.a, but since it is a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.a, I consider it admitted. He \u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6 3.a, but with an explanation that I construe as a denial, and, in any event, SOR \u00b6 3.a has been withdrawn. Applicant\u2019s admission and statements are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He has never married. He has a three-year-old son with his former fianc\u00e9e. (Item 5 at 9) Applicant enlisted in the U.S Marine Corps after graduating from high school in 2008.

He pleaded guilty to one count of each offense, received a \nsuspended sentence and probation term, and was ordered to complete a psychological \nevaluation and treatment. Although he has completed the probation term and the court-\nordered requirements, Applicant\u2019s conduct, which occurred after he submitted his \nsecurity clearance application, continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. Applicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate sexual conduct \nand criminal conduct security concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2018, in \nconnection with his employment in the defense industry.

On August 20, \n2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 9. The FORM was mailed to \nApplicant on August 26, 2021. He was afforded an opportunity to note objections and to \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and was given 30 days from \nreceipt of the FORM to do so. Applicant received the FORM on September 1, 2021. \nDOHA received his response on September 29, 2021. Applicant did not note any \nobjections to the Government\u2019s evidence. Department Counsel did not object to \nadmission of Applicant\u2019s FORM response. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 3, 2021.

Items 3 through 9 are admitted \nwithout objection, as is Applicant\u2019s FORM Response. \nIn the Government\u2019s FORM, Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline E \nallegation, which concerned Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose his arrest to his \nemployer, as required. (FORM at 3) Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 3.a is withdrawn without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not answer SOR \n\u00b6 2.a, but since it is a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.a, I consider it admitted. He \n\u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6 3.a, but with an explanation that I construe as a denial, and, in any \nevent, SOR \u00b6 3.a has been withdrawn. Applicant\u2019s admission and statements are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has never married. He has a three-year-old son \nwith his former fianc\u00e9e. (Item 5 at 9) Applicant enlisted in the U.S Marine Corps after \ngraduating from high school in 2008. He spent three years on active duty and was \nhonorably discharged in September 2011 as a lance corporal (E-3). After a year of \nunemployment, he worked for five years in the health care industry (2012-2017). He has \nworked for his current employer, a large defense contractor, since January 2018.

(Item 8 at 29) By the time police \narrived, Applicant had moved to the backyard. He went inside when he noticed a police \nofficer in his front yard. He did not answer the door right away, but instead took a \nshower. He eventually came to the door and was then taken into custody. (Item 4 at 7-8, \nItem 8) \nPolice reports reflect multiple calls to the home in June and July 2018 following \nreports of similar activity. (Item 8 at 29) According to police records, under questioning \nfrom police, Applicant admitted exposing himself and masturbating in his front yard \nabout three times a week for the previous three months. (He denied that statement in \nhis FORM Response). According to the police report, he admitted to engaging in similar \nconduct in the parking lot of a fitness club to which he belonged (leading to an earlier \npolice report), the parking lot of a convenience store, and in a park. (Item 8 at 6) \nAs Applicant explained during his background interview, he was living with his \nfianc\u00e9e at the time. She was pregnant, and they were not sexually active. These \ncircumstances left Applicant sexually frustrated. She would not allow him to watch \npornography in their home, so he would do so outside instead, on his cell phone; even, \non occasion, such as on the day of his arrest, when she was not home. (Item 4 at 7) \nApplicant was charged with four counts of indecent exposure to a person greater \nthan 15 and four counts of public indecency. In October 2018, he pleaded guilty to one \ncount of each offense and the remaining six counts were dismissed. He was given a \n180-day jail term, with all but one day suspended (that day was time served), and \nsentenced to 12 months of supervised probation and six months of unsupervised \nprobation. He was fined $2,500 (suspended) and ordered to participate in a \npsychological evaluation. (Item 5 at 5-8; Item 6) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a) \nApplicant had a one-hour psychiatric evaluation with a DNP (doctor of nursing \npractice) in February 2019. He was diagnosed with \u201cadjustment disorders with \ndepressed mood.\u201d (Item 5 at 9-13) He did not meet the criteria for sex addiction, but \nwas found to be \u201cat risk.\u201d (Item 5 at 12) Documentation from the evaluation reflects that \nApplicant reported that he sought counseling from the VA after his arrest, and that the \nVA therapist told him he no longer needed sessions, but no details were provided and \nthe VA counseling is undocumented. (Item 5 at 9) He successfully completed the \nrequirements of his probation and it was terminated early, in October 2019. (Item 5 at \n14) \nApplicant\u2019s conduct led to the end of his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e. He moved \nin with his parents. His parents, his sister, and some close friends are aware of his \nactions. (Item 4 at 10) \nIn his FORM response, Applicant wrote that \u201cthis entire situation has been \nembarrassing and emotionally painful.\u201d This is his only arrest. As noted above, he did \nnot recall stating to police he had \u201cexposed himself three times a week for the last three \nmonths prior to the arrest.\u201d He said it was never brought to his attention that he was at \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrisk for sex addiction or needed more treatment.

He said he needs his job to care \nfor his young son. (FORM response). \nApplicant provided no documentation with either his Answer or his FORM \nresponse of any reference letters, work evaluations, or other materials for consideration \nunder the whole-person concept or in mitigation. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis  \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant was arrested in July 2018 on multiple counts of indecent exposure and \npublic indecency after he was observed fully naked outside his home, masturbating \nwhile watching pornography on his cell phone. The police report reflects that Applicant \nadmitted engaging in this activity in other public locations around that time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \n13(c) and 13(d) apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nIn June and July 2018, Applicant was observed on multiple occasions fully naked \nand masturbating in public, on some occasions while watching pornography on his cell \nphone. He did so during a period of sexual frustration while his fianc\u00e9e was pregnant. \nHis fianc\u00e9e did not approve of his actions. He chose to do so outside, in public, both in \nthe front yard of his own property, and in other public areas. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 14(a) is not applicable, since Applicant\u2019s actions occurred during adulthood. \nApplicant\u2019s actions put him in position where he might have been subject to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. His actions ended his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, and \nhis family and close friends are aware of his conduct. His subsequent arrest is also a \nmatter of public record. Thus, AG \u00b6 14(c) has some application. \nAG \u00b6 14(e) has some application. Applicant participated in a court-ordered \npsychological evaluation, and, while he was found to be \u201cat risk,\u201d he was not found to \nmeet the criteria for sex addiction, so no treatment was deemed necessary. He also \npursued counseling with the VA, and was told he did not need further counseling. \nApplicant engaged in this activity during a period of sexual frustration in his \nrelationship with his pregnant fianc\u00e9e. Perhaps not surprisingly, that relationship ended \nbecause of his actions. His actions were limited to the summer of 2018, more than three \nyears ago. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s conduct is too recent to be considered fully \nmitigated. He engaged in this conduct while his current security clearance application \nwas pending adjudication, a time when an individual might be expected to be \nparticularly mindful of the importance of exercising good judgment, particularly in public. \nHe showed extremely poor judgment in engaging in this activity in public, on numerous \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccasions, not only on his own property (in the front yard, while fully naked) but in other \npublic areas as well.

AG \u00b6 14(b) \ndoes not apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s July 2018 arrest, for multiple counts of indecent exposure and public \nindecency, satisfies AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b). \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) has some application, as Applicant successfully completed probation \nand did so a year early. Yet there is little record evidence of his job training, good \nemployment record, or constructive employment which might have been considered \nhere, or under the whole-person concept, below.

Given the pattern of extremely poor \njudgment shown, his actions are simply too recent. AG \u00b6 32(a) therefore does not apply. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D and J in my whole-person analysis. As noted, Applicant provided no \nevidence beyond his own statements. Since he elected a decision on the written record, \nin lieu of a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to ask him questions about his \nconduct and his efforts towards rehabilitation. I also had no opportunity to observe \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor, and thus, to assess his credibility beyond the documentary \nrecord. The simple fact in this case is that Applicant engaged in a pattern of extremely \npoor judgment only months after submitting an application for a security clearance. His \nactions are too recent to warrant a determination that they are fully mitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s acts of extremely poor judgment, in public, cannot be mitigated on this \nrecord. He has not shown that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:   \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

On \nOctober 2, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline I. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 16, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

On June 14, 2022, Applicant\u2019s \nattorney entered an appearance and requested that the hearing be postponed to enable \nhim to prepare. The request for a postponement was granted, and the hearing was \nrescheduled for June 27, 2020. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. At Department \nCounsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took administrative notice of \nthe section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \n(DSM-5), pertaining to Delusional Disorder. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on July 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b and denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 48-year-old security guard employed by a federal contractor since \nFebruary 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1993 to February \n2006 and received an honorable discharge. There is no evidence that he had any \ndisciplinary problems in the Army. He was a federal counter-terrorism agent from \nSeptember 2006 to September 2007. He worked for various non-federal employers in \nvarious capacities involving law enforcement and physical security from July 2010 until \nhe was hired by his current employer. There is no evidence of unusual behavior since \nJuly 2010. He currently is a site supervisor for three security agents. He testified that he \nheld a security clearance in 2006 while employed by another government agency. At \npresent, he does not have an active clearance. (Tr. 22.) \nApplicant married in 2004 and divorced in 2006 due to cultural differences. His ex-\nwife wanted to live with her parents in a foreign country, and he wanted to return to the \nUnited States after his discharge from the Army. He has no children. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his employment as a federal \ncounter-terrorism agent was terminated under the pretense that he suffered from a mental \ndisorder. He claimed that he was a victim of organized gang stalking by subversive agents \nusing space-based satellite weapons systems. His answer included 100 case studies of \nindividuals claiming that they were victims of organized stalking, torture and abuse using \ndirected energy and neurological weapons that resulted in disruption of senses and bodily \nfunctions, and relentless thought control, all controlled remotely by radio frequency.1 The \n1 Applicant refers to the Space Preservation Act of 2001 in his answer and attached a copy of the Act to his \nanswer. The Act was introduced in the House of Representatives in 2001, 2002, and 2005. In each case it \nwas referred to committee and no further action ensued.

(Tr. 58.) \nApplicant testified that after a work trip in 2007, he told a fellow agent that he \nnoticed \u201chard surveillance,\u201d consisting of an unusual number of agents at the airport \nwhere they landed. After returning from the work trip, he was questioned about what he \nhad observed, and he filed a report about his observations. He also reported that other \nagents were spreading false rumors about him. He was taken to a medical facility but he \nrefused to voluntarily admit himself. (Tr. 34-40) \nIn 2007, Applicant telephonically contacted the local field office of a federal law-\nenforcement agency several times and reported that there were subversive activities \ngoing on in his agency. He then went to the headquarters of the law-enforcement agency, \nhoping to talk personally with an agent, but he was turned away by the security guard at \nthe entrance. At the hearing, he testified that, as he was leaving the headquarters office \nin his vehicle, he was stopped by several law-enforcement agents, briefly detained, and \nthen allowed to leave. (Tr. 25-28) \nApplicant was living with his father and stepmother when he was terminated from \nhis counter-terrorism position. He testified that when he tried to explain to his father and \nstepmother why he was terminated, his stepmother became concerned about his mental \nhealth. After his stepmother called his employer and inquired about the reason for his \ntermination, she notified local law-enforcement authorities, and Applicant was \ninvoluntarily hospitalized for four or five days. The record does not contain any \ndocumentary evidence of his diagnosis or treatment. He testified that hospital personnel \ntold him that he was hospitalized because he was delusional. He testified that he was \ngiven a medication to help him sleep while he was hospitalized and was advised to \ncontinue using the medication after discharge. He did not continue taking the medication. \nHe did not receive any other treatment recommendations. (Tr. 28-32.) \nApplicant testified that some of his coworkers are \u201chome-grown terrorists\u201d who \nengage in organized stalking. (Tr. 45-46.) He believes that these coworkers were \nsurveilling him and using electronic technology to transmit sounds and thoughts into his \nhead. (Tr. 52.) He testified that he continues to be targeted daily. He has experienced \nmuscular weakness and has been targeted with misinformation. He testified that \u201cyou \nbasically live almost like a slave inside the United States . . . for the duration of the time \nthat you\u2019re sitting under the satellite.\u201d (Tr. 64.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he continued to tell federal \nagencies and members of the intelligence community that he was still a federal agent \nbecause he was falsely terminated from his position. He stated that he had never \n\u201cbrandished\u201d his title after he was terminated. He testified that \u201ctechnically\u201d he was still a \nfederal agent because his termination was accomplished by a criminal act against him. \n(Tr. 61-62.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn March 2020, DOD CAF referred Applicant to a licensed psychologist for \nevaluation. The psychologist diagnosed Applicant with a \u201cdelusional disorder, persecutory \ntype.\u201d She concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s termination \nof employment, \ninpatient \nhospitalization, encounter with a law-enforcement agency, and lack of mental-health \ntreatment make it likely that additional lapses of judgment due to delusional thinking may \ncontinue to occur. She also concluded that, because Applicant does not believe he has a \npsychiatric problem, it is unlikely that he will voluntarily seek professional help in the \nfuture. His current prognosis is \u201cpoor,\u201d and she believes that his condition poses a \nsignificant risk to his judgment regarding classified information, and the risk of future \nmental health concerns is high without adequate psychiatric care. (GX 2 at 5-6.) \nThe psychologist\u2019s clinical observations noted that Applicant arrived early for his \nevaluation, was alert, and fully oriented. His attention was focused and normal. His \ncomprehension was normal. He appeared neat and clean. He displayed no unusual \nmannerisms. His affect was appropriate for the setting. He smiled regularly and was \ncooperative. (GX 2 at 4.) \nThe diagnostic criteria for a delusional disorder are described in DSM-5 as follows: \nA. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or \nlonger. \nB. Criteria A for schizophrenia has never been met. Note: Hallucinations, if \npresent, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (e.g., \nthe sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of \ninfestation.) \nC. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning \nis not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd. \nD. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been \nbrief relative to the duration of the delusional periods. \nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a \nsubstance or another medical condition and is not better explained by \nanother mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or \nobsessive-compulsive disorder. \nThe DSM-5 notes that the functional impairment of delusional disorder \u201cis usually \nmore circumscribed than that seen with other psychotic disorders.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \nthat he continues to claim that he is a federal agent despite his termination in 2007 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b), and that in or around March 2020, he was diagnosed by a licensed psychologist \napproved by the Department of Defense with a delusional disorder, persecutory type, that \nthe risk of future mental health issues is high, that his prognosis is poor, and that his \ncondition poses a significant risk to his judgment concerning classified information (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and are sufficient to raise the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant does not \nbelieve that he has a psychological condition. He has not sought or received counseling \nor treatment. He has not received a favorable prognosis. There is no evidence that his \ncondition was temporary or is under control or in remission. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant sincerely believes that he does not have a psychological \ncondition and that he is a victim of space-based neurological weapons systems. He has \nnot overcome the opinion of the psychologist that his present condition poses a risk \nsignificant to his judgment regarding classified information. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his psychological condition. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that he made poor financial choices. He vacationed in foreign \ncountries in 2010, 2011, March 2013, and August 2013. He was arrested for DUI in \n2013, which cost him more than $10,000 in fines and attorney fees. He netted about \n$50,000 from the sale of his condominium, which he planned to use to pay his debts, \nbut his wife was unable to find work because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nApplicant\u2019s finances have improved. His wife is working. He has not accrued any \nnew delinquent debt. He receives about $301 per month in disability pay from the VA, \nand he has a surplus at the end of the month. He has been saving money, which he \nplans to use to settle the SOR debts. However, intentions to resolve financial problems \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other \nresponsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There are no applicable \nmitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. at 14-15, 29-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4) Applicant submitted a \nletter from a friend with the following declaration: \nI am aware that [Applicant] is trying to get [a] security clearance but had \nan issue getting it due to his statement on prior marijuana use. I know he \nstopped using it several years ago because of work, for future jobs, and \nhealth. During a trip to [City] in August 2021, a friend from [State] brought \nsome marijuana gummies and offered them to the group. [Applicant] did \nnot have any stating he stopped for the reasons above. (AE A) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and moral character. He is praised for his honesty, reliability, veracity, \ndependability, loyalty, professionalism, dedication, work ethic, efficiency, maturity, and \nintegrity. The authors of the letters recommend that he retain his security clearance. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25.

The above \nmitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those \nconcerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant intentionally provided false information about his marijuana use on the \n2013 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.

He is credited with \nfinally coming clean in April 2019, but that is insufficient to overcome the lie that enabled \nhim to obtain a security clearance. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and that he now appears to be telling the truth. \nApplicant likely would not have received a security clearance in 2013 if he told the truth. \nHowever, if he had told the truth initially and actually stopped using marijuana, he \nalmost certainly would have a security clearance today and in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

He set up a payment plan for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, for $200 per month to begin in April 2021, and ending in February \n2022.

Applicant is financially stable and lives within his means. He is \nable to pay his oldest daughter\u2019s college tuition and living expenses without incurring \ndebt. After paying the household\u2019s recurring bills, he has $2,000 in disposable income. \nThe most recent credit report in the record dated April 2022 shows no delinquent \naccounts. Each of the 21 reported accounts is in good standing. (Tr. 34-34, 39-40; GE \n2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the financial considerations \nguideline. Applicant\u2019s admissions as well as the documents in the record support the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case. \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant admits to owing $28,152 on two \ndelinquent debts. The record supports the application of the following financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record also supports the application of the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not incur the delinquent debts under circumstances that indicate \nirresponsible or reckless financial behavior. After the issuance of the SOR, Applicant \nmade seven payments, totaling $1,400, toward the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The \ncreditor has cancelled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Here, Applicant\u2019s financial problems do not \nraise any behavior that indicates poor self-control, or an intentional unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations that may hinder his ability to properly handle or safeguard \nclassified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish that he has a history of \nfinancial problems dating back to 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant accrued approximately $38,000 in delinquent debt because of \nunderemployment, a condition beyond his control. In 2019, he reported his financial \nissues and efforts to resolve those debts during the security clearance process. He also \nworked with a debt counseling and consolidation service, provided evidence of payment \non his accrued debt, and sought more lucrative employment in an effort to resolve his \nfinancial problems. He subsequently found better paying, more stable employment and \ncontinued to pay his debt down. Record evidence reflects that he resolved approximately \n$3,899 of his delinquent debt before the SOR was issued, and resolved an additional \n$29,498 of delinquent debt before responding to the FORM. He provided documentary \nevidence that he negotiated repayment agreements with his remaining creditors, and that \nhe was in compliance with those agreements when he responded to the FORM. His \nrecent credit records reflect that he is current on all other accounts. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).  An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in \nhis debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that \nan [he] act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017).  \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, he received financial \ncounseling, found better employment, initiated and adhered to good-faith efforts to repay \nhis creditors, has resolved almost 90% of his delinquent debt, and has reached payment \nagreements with creditors for the remaining debt. Based upon the entire record, I \nconclude that the circumstances that led to his financial difficulties are unlikely to recur \nand do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nMitigating Conditions 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. A fair and commonsense assessment of the \nrecord evidence as a whole supports a conclusion that the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.
