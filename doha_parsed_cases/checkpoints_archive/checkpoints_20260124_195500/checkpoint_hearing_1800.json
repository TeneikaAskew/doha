Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: I. Charles McCullough, III, Esq. \n02/03/2021 \nDecision \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his eligibility \nfor a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant has three friends who \nare residents and citizens of Israel, and another friend who is a citizen and resident of \nTurkey. The security concerns raised by these friendships are mitigated by the casual \nand infrequent nature of the relationships. Applicant failed to present sufficient information \nto mitigate the security concern raised by his relationships with his parents-in-law and \nsister-in-law, who are residents and citizens of Syria. In particular, Applicant failed to \nprovide enough information to evaluate fully the potential security risks raised by his \nfather-in-law\u2019s status as a retired military officer. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2019, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the foreign influence guideline. The Agency acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed \nby President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the \ncase be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke or \ndeny Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. A hearing was \ninitially scheduled for April 28, 2020, but was continued in response to the Covid-19 \npandemic. The hearing was rescheduled for September 30, 2020. At the hearing, I \nadmitted as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \u2013 III: the case management order issued on \nSeptember 4, 2020; the discovery letter the Government sent to Applicant, serving him \nwith the documents supporting the Government\u2019s case against him, dated February 12, \n2020; and, the letter and exhibit list Applicant submitted in response to the case \nmanagement order, dated September 30, 2020.

(Tr. 17-18) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 29, has worked for his current employer since June 2018. He completed \na security clearance application, his first, in September 2018. At the time Applicant \ncompleted the application he was unmarried. However, he listed one foreign national \ncontact, an ex-girlfriend with whom he kept in touch. The DOD CAF did not find this \ncontact to be of security significance. During his January 2019 interview with a \nbackground investigator, Applicant disclosed additional foreign contacts to include three \nfriends from Israel and one friend from Turkey. These relationships are alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f. (GE 1 -2) \nTurkey \nDuring the course of obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations, \nApplicant participated in a study abroad program in Turkey in 2010. During that trip he \ndeveloped a friendship with a Turkish citizen. This relationship is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nWhen Applicant returned to Turkey in 2013 to teach English, Applicant lived with his \nfriend\u2019s family while he looked for an apartment. Applicant\u2019s friend completed his required \nmilitary service, but is no longer affiliated with the Turkish military or government. He \ncurrently works in the tourism industry.

Applicant last traveled to Turkey in 2015. \nHis friend has not traveled to the United States. (Tr. 131, 141-144; GE 1; AE B-C) \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system and a \npresident. The U.S.-Turkey friendship dates to 1831. Turkey is an important U.S. security \npartner and has been a valued North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally since 1952. \nTurkey is a leader in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. Turkey also \nis a vital member of the Counter-ISIL Coalition. Turkey continues to face a significant \nterrorist threat from both external and home-grown sources. The current U.S. State \nDepartment travel warning for Turkey reflects an increased risk from terrorist groups and \nthe potential for violence against U.S. citizens due to an increase in anti-American \nrhetoric. In the aftermath of the July 2016 coup attempt, the U.S. State Department has \nalso reported a number of significant human rights problems in Turkey. Of particular \nconcern are reports, including arbitrary killings, suspicious deaths of persons in custody, \nforced disappearances, torture, and the arbitrary arrests and detention of tens of \nthousands of persons, including opposition members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, \nforeign citizens, and Turkish nationals with purported claims to \u201cterrorist\u201d groups or \nengaging in peaceful legitimate speech. (HE VI) \nIsrael \n \nApplicant returned from Turkey in 2014 to begin a master\u2019s degree program in \nInternational Affairs at a U.S. university. During his studies, he befriended a classmate, a \nU.S. citizen, who subsequently immigrated to Israel in 2017. This relationship is alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant\u2019s friend serves in the Israeli Defense Forces. The two men have \nseen each other twice since their graduation in 2016 at informal class reunions, the most \nrecent being in September 2019. They maintained monthly contact through an electronic \nmessaging application from 2016 until February 2020, when Applicant unilaterally ended \nthe relationship, out of concern that the relationship would adversely affect his ability his \nto gain access to classified information. Applicant admits that his friend is aware of \nApplicant\u2019s employment with a federal contracting company and that Applicant works on \na military installation. According to Applicant, the friend does not know the details of \nApplicant\u2019s job or his clearance status. (Tr. 136-138, 175; AE B-C) \nWhile participating in a study-abroad program in Israel in 2015, Applicant met a \nwoman at a restaurant with whom he became friends. This relationship is alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. Before their meeting, the woman had completed her compulsory military service \nand was working as a human resources professional at a private company. He has not \nhad in-person contact with her since 2015, but the two maintained contact through an \nelectronic messaging application a few times per year. According to Applicant, they have \nnot had any contact in over one year. Applicant described the relationship as casual and \nsuperficial. The woman is not aware of Applicant\u2019s employment with a federal contracting \ncompany or his attempt to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 134-136, 175-177; AE B-C) \nApplicant also admitted to having another friend, also a citizen of Israel, who was \nemployed by the Israeli Trade Mission in the city where Applicant resides. This \nrelationship is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The two men met through friends and typically \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninteracted in group settings. Applicant admits that the man knew of his status as the \nemployee of a federal contracting company, and that he worked on a military installation. \nAccording to Applicant, the man did not know the details of Applicant\u2019s job or his clearance \nstatus. Applicant\u2019s last contact with the man was in November 2019, when the man \nreturned to Israel. Applicant has learned through mutual friends that the man no longer \nworks for the Israeli Trade Mission. (Tr. 138-140; AE B-C) \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral parliament and a prime \nminister, who exercises extensive executive power. The United States and Israel have \nmaintained diplomatic relations with Israel since 1949 and have always had strong \nbilateral relations. The United States extends substantial foreign aid to Israel and provides \nsignificant military support as well. The United States is also Israel\u2019s largest trading \npartner. Israel cooperates closely with the United States and other countries on \ncounterterrorism issues. Despite its close relationship with the United States, Israel has \nbeen involved in numerous instances of illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. \nrestricted and classified technology and products, including dual-use technology. Israel \ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens. When human-rights violations have occurred, \nthey have involved Palestinian detainees or Arab-Israelis. Terrorist suicide bombings are \na continuing threat in Israel, and U.S. citizens in Israel are advised to be cautious. Israel \nconsiders U.S. citizens with Israeli citizenship or who are eligible for Israeli citizenship to \nbe Israeli citizens for immigration and other legal purposes. Dual U.S.-Israeli citizens must \nenter and depart Israel using Israeli passports. U.S. citizens visiting Israel who also have \nor may have Israeli citizenship have been subjected to prolonged questioning and \nthorough searches by Israeli authorities upon entry or departure. (HE V) \nSyria \nIn July 2019, Applicant married a naturalized U.S. citizen from Syria. In response \nto interrogatories propounded by DOHA, Applicant provided information about his \nparents-in-law and sister-in-law who are citizens and residents of Syria. These \nrelationships are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n4 \n \nThe Syrian Arab Republic is ruled by an authoritarian regime dominated by the \nSocialist Ba\u2019ath Party currently engaged in a full-scale civil war with the armed Syrian \nopposition. Since 1979, the United States has designated Syria a State Sponsor of \nTerrorism due to its continuing political and military support to various terrorist groups as \nwell as its support of the Iranian government. Over the past decade, the Syrian \ngovernment has demonstrated a permissive attitude towards al-Qa\u2019ida and other terrorist \ngroups\u2019 foreign fighter facilitation efforts during the Iraq conflict that fed the growth of al-\nQa\u2019ida, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and affiliated terrorist networks inside \nSyria. In addition, the Syrian government has engaged in numerous human rights \nviolations to include arbitrary killings and detentions, the use of chemical weapons against \ncivilians, enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary and unlawful interference with \nprivacy, and undue restrictions on freedom of movement. During 2018, government-\nlinked paramilitary groups reportedly engaged in frequent violations and abuses, including \nmassacres, indiscriminate killings, kidnappings of civilians, arbitrary detentions, and rape \nas a war tactic. Government-affiliated militia repeatedly targeted civilians. The Syrian \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment took no steps to investigate, prosecute, or punish officials who committed \nhuman rights violations or abuses. (HE V) \nThe actions of the Syrian government against U.S. interests is well documented. \nThe Syrian government was aware of, and encouraged for many years, the transit of \nterrorists through Syria into Iraq for the purpose of fighting U.S. forces. In December 2015, \nPresident Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program improvement and Terrorist \nTravel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing Visa Waiver Program. Under \nthe 2015 amendment, citizens of Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United \nStates under the Visa Waiver program. The exclusion of Syria from waiver eligibility \nreflects the determination of the Secretary of Homeland Security that the presence of an \nindividual from that country increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat \nto the national security of the United States; that a foreign terrorist organization has a \nsignificant presence in the country; or that Syria is a safe haven for terrorists. In \nSeptember 2017, the Government suspended the entry of Syrian nationals into the United \nStates, citing concerns over significant inadequacies of the country\u2019s identity-\nmanagement protocols, the country\u2019s failure to share public safety and terrorism \ninformation, and the country\u2019s status as the source of significant terrorist threats. U.S. \ncitizens are also warned against traveling to Syria due to concerns about terrorism, \nkidnapping, and armed conflict. The U.S Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations \nin February 2012. (HE V) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, 69, is a retired Syrian military officer. In his October 2019 \nresponses to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported that none of his Syrian in-laws \nhad ties to any foreign government, military, or intelligence service. In response to the \nSOR, Applicant reported that his father-in-law was a retired \u201cAir Force Brigadier.\u201d At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that the term \u201cbrigadier\u201d in Arabic did not refer to a flag officer \nas it does in English and that he was mistaken in using the term. Applicant has never met \nhis in-laws. His communication with them is limited as he does not speak Arabic and his \nin-laws do not speak English. The information in the record about Applicant\u2019s in-laws is \nbased on the testimony of his wife. (Tr. 93, 133-134, 146; GE 2; AE B \u2013C) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that her father retired in approximately 2001, when she \nwas 18 years old. He served in the Syrian military throughout her childhood. She testified \nthat her father graduated from a military academy in Syria and was an officer. Applicant\u2019s \nwife corroborated Applicant\u2019s testimony that the term \u201cbrigadier\u201d in Arabic is not \nassociated with a general\u2019s rank as it is in the American military. However, Applicant\u2019s \nwife could not clarify the nature of her father\u2019s job in the Syrian military or his rank upon \nretirement. Applicant provided AE O, a letter obtained by his wife, from a Syrian \norganization of retired military members. Applicant presented Applicant both the original \nletter as written in Arabic and an English translation. The letter indicates that Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law has been associated with the veteran\u2019s organization since at least 2002. The \nletter, which was signed by a retired general, does not indicate his father-in-law\u2019s rank \nupon retirement. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that her father does have some interaction with \nother individuals associated with the Syrian military. Neither AE O nor Applicant\u2019s wife \nprovided details about the extent, frequency, or nature of her father\u2019s contact with current \nor former Syrian military members. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that her father receives a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmonthly pension of $50,000 Syrian pounds, which Applicant\u2019s wife claims to be valued at \n$100 U.S. dollars. Since retiring, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law has worked in the real estate \nindustry in Syria. (Tr. 93, 104-114, 112-125, 147; AE O) \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, 59, currently works as a member of the technical \neducation staff at a Syrian university. Both of Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are members of \nthe Ba\u2019ath Party, which Applicant\u2019s wife describes as the default political party. She \ntestified that neither of her parents is politically active. Applicant\u2019s wife stated that her \nparents are financially self-sufficient. They own their home as well as a home in her \nfather\u2019s hometown. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law, 25, is a student at a Syrian university. In \n2020, Applicant\u2019s wife filed petitions with the United States Customs and Immigration \nServices, seeking permission to sponsor her parents\u2019 immigration to the United States. \n(Tr. 93, 95, 103-104, 118-119, 125-126, 148, 150-157; AE B. N-O). \nApplicant\u2019s wife typically speaks telephonically to her parents at least once a week \nand communicates with her sister daily through an electronic messaging application. \nSince immigrating to the United States in 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife has returned to Syria \nevery two years to visit her parents and sister. Her last trip was in 2018. She currently \nhas no plans to return to Syria, citing her concerns about traveling during the Covid-19 \npandemic as well as the potential adverse implications of her travel on her husband\u2019s \nsecurity clearance application. The couple discussed meeting Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family in \nEurope to facilitate their first meeting. However, the couple decided to postpone the trip \nindefinitely. (Tr. 98-102, 127-128) \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. All of her assets are \nbased in the United States. Aside from his in-laws, Applicant\u2019s familial ties are all in the \nUnited States, as are his assets. (Tr. 97-98, 102, 150, 170, 173, 177-178) \nSince college, Applicant has dedicated himself to the study of international \nrelations. As a result, he is well traveled and has developed friendships with people from \nall over the world. In support of his application for security clearance, four character \nwitnesses spoke on Applicant\u2019s behalf. All are long-time clearance holders. All have \nsignificant intelligence and counter-intelligence experience. Each witness unequivocally \nrecommended Applicant for a security clearance, citing his professionalism, and his \nappreciation and understanding of the security concerns related to his position. One \nwitness in particular, a major in the U.S. Army, described the necessity of some clearance \nholders to have relationships with foreign nationals to further the important work of the \nUnited States government. The witness opined that Applicant was able to balance these \nrelationships with his duties as a clearance holder. (Tr, 23-89; GE 1; AE B, E-I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests . . .are a national security concern . . . if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interest or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure and coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) An assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign interest is \nlocated, including but not limited to, consideration of whether it is known to target U.S. \ncitizens to obtain classified or sensitive information, or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nThe SOR alleges as disqualifying Applicant\u2019s friendships with individuals from \nTurkey, Israel and Syria. The Government established its prima facie case that each of \nthe alleged relationships are disqualifying under AG \u00b6 7(a): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[C]ontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heighted risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nOnce the Government establishes its prima facie case, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to present witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts he has admitted or those established by Department Counsel. Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable clearance decision. (DOD \nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.15.) \nApplicant has met his burden of mitigation regarding his friendships with individuals \nwho are citizens and residents of Turkey (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and Israel (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.f). \nIndividuals seeking security clearance eligibility are not required to limit their personal, \nsocial, or professional relationships to individuals who are U.S citizens or U.S nationals. \nHere, Applicant established that he has no affinity toward either Israel or Turkey. He has \nalso established that those friendships are casual and that he is not bound to those foreign \nnationals by bonds of obligation or affection. The following mitigating conditions apply: \n AG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, or country is also minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interests; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so causal and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nHowever, the same analysis does not apply to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nparents-in-law and sister-in-law who are citizens and residents of Syria. The U.S. \nGovernment has designated Syria a State Sponsor of Terrorism and has also determined \nthat the Syrian government has a history of acting against U.S. interests. The \nGovernment\u2019s concerns regarding Syria are such that Syrian nationals are barred from \nentering the United States at this time, and U.S. citizens are encouraged not to travel to \nthere. \nGiven the relatively adverse relationship between the two countries, as well as the \nstatus of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, a retired Syrian Air Force officer, the security risk \nremains. The security risk is not mitigated because Applicant has never met his in-laws \nin person or because they do not speak the same language. Though Applicant may not \nhave any direct ties of obligation to his in-laws, those bonds of obligation are imputed to \nhim through his wife, who maintains close relationships with her parents and sister, as \nevidenced by the frequency of her contact with her Syrian family through phone calls, \nmessaging applications, and bi-annual visits to her home country. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplication of the foreign influence mitigating conditions also requires \nconsideration of the personal and professional activities of Applicant\u2019s in-laws in Syria. \nThe Government placed Applicant on notice in the October 2019 interrogatories that the \nGovernment had concerns about his Syrian in-laws. At the hearing, Applicant relied on \nhis wife\u2019s testimony to provide information about her family. However, she could not \nprovide any pertinent details about her father\u2019s military service to include his rank upon \nretirement, the nature of his job in the Syrian military, or the nature and extent of his \nongoing interaction with other individuals associated with the Syrian military. These \nmissing facts prevent a full assessment of the potential risks associated with this \nrelationship and the extent to which Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s status as a retired military \nofficer affects Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and sister-in-law. This missing information also \nprevents the application of any of the foreign influence mitigating conditions to these \nrelationships. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). A finding that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nrelationship with his Syrian in-laws does not suggest that Applicant is untrustworthy or \nunreliable. It is not a finding that Applicant is unable to follow the rules regarding the \nproper handling and safeguarding classified information. It is a finding necessitated by \nthe limited information in the record. Without more information, Applicant\u2019s close ties to \nSyrian citizens presents an unacceptable risk that he may be influenced to act \ninconsistent with U.S. interests, and creates doubt about his suitability for access to \nclassified information. Ultimately, any unresolved questions or concerns must be resolved \nin favor of protecting the national security. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 24, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He is a high school graduate and has earned some \ncollege credits. He married in 2008. His wife had a child that he adopted, and they also \nhave two other children. Their ages are 26, 20 and 18. Applicant has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2018. (Tr. 15-18) \nIn 2015 Applicant had a motorcycle accident and was severely injured. He had two \nsurgeries on his back, and he was unable to work for about three years. His job involved \nmanual labor. He was working at the time and was later terminated. He was cleared to \nresume work in late 2017 or early 2018. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his \naccident and being unable to work. His wife was working during this time and continues \nto work, but her income was insufficient to cover all of their family\u2019s expenses. Applicant \nalso acknowledged that he had some debts prior to his accident that he had difficulty \npaying. (Tr. 18-22, 34-36, 45-47) \nInitially, Applicant attempted to contact some creditors to negotiate settlements or \nrepayment plans, but was unable to do so because they either demanded the full amount \nbe paid or the payment plans were more money than he could afford. More recently, \nApplicant has contacted some creditors, but the debts had been sold to third-party \ncollection companies, and they wanted full payment of the debts. He has been unable to \nmake payments on any of his delinquent debts due to the amounts owed. (Tr. 22-23, 39\u00ad\n42) \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, statements to a government investigator, and credit reports from August \n2019, February 2020, and May 2021. A review of the May 2021 credit report shows that \nthe accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g and 1.k were resolved by dispute. (GE 1 through 6) \nApplicant\u2019s son attends college and receives a scholarship for his tuition, but \nApplicant pays for his room and board, which is about $5,000 a semester. His older \ndaughter is independent, and his younger daughter lives at home. He and his son have \ncars. One is paid for and the other is financed. His wife drives a car that is leased. \nApplicant also owes about $50,000 for student loans. These loans are in deferment, which \nApplicant indicated expires sometime at the end of this year. He anticipated his payments \nto be approximately $250 a month.

He would like to consolidate his debt when he is able. He estimated \nhis annual salary is about $27,000 and his wife\u2019s is about $23,000. Over the three years \nhe was unable to work, he estimated his out-of-pocket medical expenses were about \n$10,000. He lost his medical insurance when he lost his job after his accident. He used \ncredit cards to help pay his expenses and at times had difficulty paying his rent and \nproviding for his family. His parents helped them out. Applicant currently lives paycheck \nto paycheck. (Tr. 25, 29-35, 49-50) \nApplicant stated that he used Credit Karma to dispute some of his delinquent debts \nto have them removed from his credit report. He had questions about the amounts owed \nand believed there were inaccuracies on his credit report. He did not provide any \nsupporting documents. (Tr. 47-53) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that remain unresolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a motorcycle accident he had in 2015. \nHe had surgeries and lost his job and medical insurance. He was unable to pay his debts. \nThese were conditions beyond his control. He testified that he contacted creditors in the \npast to resolve his debts, but he has been unable to do so because he does not have the \nmoney. His debts remain unresolved. He stated that he disputed some debts to have \nthem removed from his credit report. I have given him credit for those accounts that are \non his latest credit report that note they were resolved. He did not provide any documents \nto substantiate other disputes or actions to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, \nbut Applicant did not provide evidence that he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. His debts are recent and ongoing. There is insufficient evidence to fully \napply any of the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant was in a serious accident in 2015. He was unable to pay his bills at the \ntime. He is unable to meet the creditors\u2019 demands to resolve his delinquent debts. At this \njuncture, he has an unreliable financial track record, and he has not met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He completed his compulsory military service in 2004. Applicant initially came to \nthe United States in 2004 with a J-1 visa to participate in an internship program. During \nthe internship program, Applicant met his future wife \u2013 a U.S. citizen by birth. The \ncouple married in 2005 and Applicant was able to obtain permanent resident status. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2009. (Tr. 21-22, 47, 52-83; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s father and stepmother are citizens and residents of Turkey. They live \nin a large city on the western coast of the country. Applicant\u2019s father, 68, retired from the \nTurkish Air Force as a colonel in the late 1990s, when Applicant was in middle school. \nApplicant testified that although his father trained to be a pilot, he spent his military \ncareer managing retail establishments on Turkish military bases. In the 30 years since \nretiring, Applicant\u2019s father has owned and operated a series of small businesses. On his \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he gave his father $52,000, \nwhich Applicant believes his father used as capital for a business venture. Applicant \nprovided the money from the savings he and his wife accumulated. He does not expect \nhis father to repay the money and sees it as an offering of gratitude for the financial \nsupport his father provided him through college. Applicant\u2019s stepmother is a French \nteacher who is retired from a public university. Applicant\u2019s father and stepmother \nreceive pensions from the Turkish government. They are financially self-sufficient and \ndo not rely on him for ongoing financial support. (Tr. 29-31, 46, 48, 53-56, 58; GE 1) \nApplicant communicates with his father and stepmother a few times per month \nthrough video chats, primarily to allow his parents to see their granddaughter. Applicant \nhas not traveled to Turkey since 2007. His father and stepmother have a current tourist \nvisas to enter the United States. They have visited on four occasions for vacations with \nApplicant and his family. (Tr. 28, 49-51, 88) \nAside from his father and stepmother, Applicant has no other ties to Turkey and \nhe is not seeking to create any additional ties. Applicant considers himself firmly rooted \nto the United States by his family and the community in which he and his wife have \nchosen to live. He completed his master\u2019s degree at a U.S. university in 2013. Applicant \nand his wife have one child, age six who is a U.S. citizen by birth. They are expecting \ntheir second child in January 2021. Applicant and his wife have owned their current \nhome, their third home together, since July 2016. The couple has over $500,000 in U.S-\nbased assets. Neither Applicant nor his wife have any assets based outside of the \nUnited States. (Tr. 25-26, 31, 57, 83-85; GE 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Historically, Turkey \nhas been an ally of the United States; however, the recent political instability in the \ncountry and region has become a potential threat to U.S. interests operating there. \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationships with his father and stepmother are disqualifying \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is citizen of or resident \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heighted risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  \nApplicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns \nrelated to his relationships with his father and stepmother. Although Applicant\u2019s father \nserved in the Turkish military, he retired over 30 years ago. Aside from receiving his \npension, there is no indication that he has ongoing ties to the Turkish government or \nmilitary establishment. The record does not contain any evidence that the activities of \nApplicant\u2019s father and stepmother would draw the attention of either the Turkish \ngovernment or a non-government entity. Furthermore, while Applicant\u2019s relationships \nwith his father and stepmother are not casual, these relationships are unlikely to serve \nas a conflict of interest. The following foreign Influence mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b68(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the position or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG\u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, or country is also minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interests.  \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect and \nhandle classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s familial and financial ties to the United \nStates outweigh his ties to Turkey. He has not demonstrated divided loyalties between \nthe two nations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for this employer since December 2016. He experienced a period of unemployment while he attended college through September 2013. He is single, never married, and has no children. He has cohabitated with his girlfriend since 2015.

The allegations are supported by his disclosures to his trustworthiness application (SCA) in December 2016, statements to a defense investigator during his background investigation in January and February 2018, credit reports from March 2017, May 2019, March 2020, and April 2021, and admissions in his SOR answer. (GE 1-6; SOR Answer) Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to having to leave college because of a lack of funding in April 2013. He had a semester left but could not afford to continue. He financed his schooling, up to that point, using student loans. He experienced some health issues in approximately 2013, which required hospitalization.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 4, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nthis employer since December 2016. He experienced a period of unemployment while \nhe attended college through September 2013. He is single, never married, and has no \nchildren. He has cohabitated with his girlfriend since 2015. (Tr. at 6, 36; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant accumulated ten delinquent (four student loans \n($27,159) and six medical ($5,183)) debts totaling approximately $32,342 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.j). The allegations are supported by his disclosures to his trustworthiness application \n(SCA) in December 2016, statements to a defense investigator during his background \ninvestigation in January and February 2018, credit reports from March 2017, May 2019, \nMarch 2020, and April 2021, and admissions in his SOR answer. (GE 1-6; SOR \nAnswer) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to having to leave college because of a \nlack of funding in April 2013. He had a semester left but could not afford to continue. He \nfinanced his schooling, up to that point, using student loans. He experienced some \nhealth issues in approximately 2013, which required hospitalization. In 2015, his \ngirlfriend, with whom he was living, was involved in a serious auto accident. The brunt of \npaying the couple\u2019s bills fell on Applicant. His student loans became delinquent in \napproximately September 2013. Applicant asserted that his wages have been garnished \nin the past to pay his student loans and that either his 2019 or 2020 federal income tax \nrefund was captured by the IRS to apply towards his student loans. He failed to \ndocument either of these occurrences. He documented making a single $96 payment \ntoward his student loans in April 2019. He also documented applying for consideration \nunder a student loan rehabilitation program. He discontinued pursuing loan \nrehabilitation when he determined that the calculated payments under the program \nwould be too much. He has made no further payments or established a payment plan \ntowards his delinquent student loans and believes the current balance is approximately \n$30,000. He made a conscious choice to pay other bills before addressing his student \nloans. These debts remain unresolved. (Tr. at 24-30, 37-38; GE 3-5; SOR Answer \n(attachments)) \nApplicant claimed that he made payments toward his medical debts, but he failed \nto produce supporting documentation. His records show that he made several payments \nto his girlfriend in March 2021, but these payments cannot be correlated to any SOR \ndebt. The medical debts are unresolved.

He did not provide any budget or \nfinancial counseling information. (Tr. at 39; AE A-G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,000, most \nof which is from delinquent student loans. He chose not to pay his student loans, but \nrather address other debts first. I find all disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nstudent-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021)) \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant has not documented payment towards \nany SOR debts. While his medical issues in 2013 and his girlfriend\u2019s auto accident in \n2015 were circumstances beyond his control, he has not shown responsible action \ntoward addressing his delinquent debt. He failed to follow-up on an opportunity to \nrehabilitate his student loans. He has not provided any specific details about how he \nplans to address these debts in the future. None of the above mitigating conditions fully \napply. However, I am giving Applicant some mitigating credit for paying several non-\nSOR related debts.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, his medical issues in 2013, and his \ngirlfriend\u2019s auto accident in 2015, which caused him to pay their joint bills. However, \nApplicant made a conscious decision to ignore his student loans and failed to pay his \nmedical debts. He has not established a meaningful track record of financial \nresponsibility, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the SOR allegations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a government contractor. She began working for her employer as an intake representative in March 2018. She experienced periods of unemployment from: February to March 2018; December 2013 to July 2014; September 2012 to July 2013; and June 2011 to January 2012. She holds an associate\u2019s degree.

She experienced \nperiods of unemployment from: February to March 2018; December 2013 to July 2014; \nSeptember 2012 to July 2013; and June 2011 to January 2012. She holds an \nassociate\u2019s degree. She married in 2007, separated from her husband in 2010, and \ndivorced in 2016. She has three adult children. Her ex-husband failed to pay child \nsupport for these children when they were minors. She recently remarried in December \n2020. (Tr. 7, 18, 22-23; GE 1, 2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had five student loans in collection status totaling \n$21,348. It also alleged two collection debts from an apartment lease obligation totaling \n$3,659, and a consumer collection debt for $530. The debts were listed by Applicant in \nher security clearance application (SCA) dated March 21, 2018; discussed by her with \nan investigator during her background interview in May 2019; and listed on a credit \nreport from April 2018. (GE 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant incurred her student loan debt while attending technical school to \nreceive her associate\u2019s degree from 2011-2012. (SOR 1.a-1.e) The loans were in a \nforbearance status from approximately January 2013 until 2016. Applicant forgot to \nrenew her forbearance agreement and the loans became delinquent in approximately \n2017. The loans were assigned to a collection agency. She was told by the collector \nthat she qualified for a loan rehabilitation program. She made payments to the collector \nbefore September 2019, but she does not have supporting documentation for those \npayments. She documented that she paid the required monthly payments from \nSeptember 2019 to March 2020, when the loans were put in forbearance status due to \nCOVID-19. The loans remain in forbearance. When she was making payments, they \nwere coming directly out of her bank account. She has sufficient funds to begin making \nsimilar payments once the current forbearance period ends and she intends to do so. \nThese debts are being resolved. (Tr. 21, 26-29; AE B; SOR Answer) \nAfter Applicant separated from her husband in 2010, she moved herself and her \nchildren into an apartment complex in approximately 2012 and signed a lease. She lived \nthere several months with her daughter and granddaughter. While living there, two \ndrive-by shootings occurred at the complex. For safety reasons, Applicant decided to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ngive 30-days\u2019 notice of termination of the lease to the apartment manager and move \nout. She was given eviction papers the day she was moving out of the complex. She \nnever received any other documentation concerning the lease or eviction. She learned \nof these debts by reviewing her credit report. (SOR 1.f and 1.g, relate to the same \nunderlying debt) She contacted the current apartment manager to work out a payment \narrangement, but was told that there was no record of her or the debt. Additionally, the \ndebt no longer appears on her credit report. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 19-20; GE 4-5; \nSOR answer) \nApplicant credibly testified that the delinquent consumer debt was incurred and \neventually paid by her ex-husband. She attempted to contact him so he could provide a \nstatement to that effect, but she was unable to do so. This debt is no longer showing on \nher credit report. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 31; GE 2, 5) \nApplicant indicated that her current financial status is much improved. She and \nher second husband recently purchased a home. She stated that after paying all \nmonthly expenses, they have a remainder of approximately $1,000. They use this to \nmake extra mortgage payments or to add to their savings. Her most current credit report \nshows no delinquencies. Additionally, she provided a character statement from her \ncurrent supervisor who described Applicant as one of her most dependable team \nmembers. (Tr. 32-33; GE 5; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nApplicant became delinquent on her student loans and two other consumer \ndebts. I find both the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s incurred student loans from 2011-2012. They became delinquent \nwhen her forbearance period ended. At some point, a collection agency acquired her \nstudent loans. Applicant acted responsibly by reaching an agreement to rehabilitate her \nstudent loans. She started making her required monthly payments in September 2019 \nand continued through March 2020 when her loans were put in forbearance due to \nCOVID-19. She is current on her student loans and intends to make her required \npayments once this forbearance period ends. Concerning the lease debt, Applicant \nagain acted responsibly by contacting the creditor of the apartment complex and was \ntold there was no record of her debt. The debt no longer appears on her credit report. \nHer ex-husband resolved the remaining debt. Applicant lives within her means, recently \npurchased a home, and is now current on all her other financial obligations. All the \nabove mitigating conditions have some applicability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, her periods of unemployment, her divorce \nand lack of child support from her ex-husband, and the circumstances surrounding her \nindebtedness. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information.

In his \nAnswer, Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.d, a $13,368 charged-off account, and admits the \nremaining debts. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s March 2019 and \nJanuary 2018 credit bureau reports (CBR), discussed during his personal subject \ninterview (PSI), and partially disclosed on his e-QIP. (GX 6; GX 5; GX 4; GX 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant, 32, has been employed as a federal contractor part time since \nNovember 2017. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2009 \nuntil June 2013, which included a six-month combat deployment. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He has resided and shared expenses with his fianc\u00e9e since \n2016. He was first granted a security clearance in or about 2010. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nApplicant states that his past financial delinquencies arose due to a confluence of \nseveral \u201clife events.\u201d After leaving active duty, Applicant was unemployed from June until \nOctober 2013 when he obtained part-time seasonal employment. The part-time \nemployment ended in December 2013, and Applicant was unemployed until November \n2017 when he began working part time for his current employer. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nIn November 2011, Applicant secured a vehicle loan for approximately $15,502 \nand maintained timely payments. In December 2013, while between insurance policies, \nApplicant totaled the vehicle. Applicant believed that he had insurance that should have \ncovered the vehicle between policies and attempted to get proof of insurance from his \nprovider, but was unsuccessful. He contacted the creditor in an effort to enter a monthly \nrepayment plan, but the creditor demanded payment in full. Applicant intends to pay this \ndebt. The $11,572 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a reflects the balance due on this account. \nThe debt was charged off by the creditor. \nThe $6,675 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a delinquent credit card that Applicant \nopened in 2011. He fell behind on his payments while unemployed and incurring \nunanticipated costs after totaling his vehicle and moving. The account became delinquent \nin July 2014 with a balance of $7,500. Applicant entered a monthly repayment plan of \n$150 a month in December 2018. (GX 4; GX 6.) This debt is being resolved. \nThe $2,837 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was a secured account that was charged \noff in 2013. Both of Applicant\u2019s CBRs reflect a $0 balance due. (GX 5; GX 6.)

In June 2014, \nApplicant signed an agreement for a non-refundable deposit to hold an apartment in a \ncomplex that primarily housed college students. He did not sign a lease. While waiting for \nan apartment to become available, he needed a place to live so he rented in a different \ncomplex. He notified the original complex that he would not be renting from them in July \n2014. In 2017, Applicant discovered that the original complex had charged him for a full \nyear despite the fact that he did not sign a lease or reside in the complex. Applicant \ncontacted the complex in July 2017 to dispute the debt but was unable to reach a \nresolution. He disputed the debt with a major credit-reporting company in October 2017. \n(GX 4.)

This account has been resolved. \nApplicant does not recognize the $581 and the $646 medical debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. (GX 4.) Both debts were assigned for collection in January 2015 and closed \nin April 2015. (GX 5.) The debts do not appear on Applicant\u2019s March 2019 CBR. (GX 6.) \nDuring his PSI, Applicant explained that he is seeking higher paying employment \nopportunities and that he is actively focused on proper money management. He has no \ncurrent delinquencies and characterizes his financial status as stable, stating that he is \nsaving money, paying his bills on time, and trying to repair his credit.  \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs show a credit history dating back to 2008 that include paid-off \nstudent loans, credit cards, personal loans, a line of credit, and his 2017 apartment rental \nagreement. Despite his 2013 to 2017 period of unemployment and his ongoing \nunderemployment, Applicant has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2015. He lives \nwithin his means and does not have any open credit accounts. (GX 6.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAfter leaving active duty in June 2013, Applicant was unemployed, with the \nexception of a two-month seasonal employment from October through December 2013, \nuntil he gained his current part-time employment in November 2017. During his more than \nfour years of unemployment, Applicant overall maintained his finances. However, due to \nunusual circumstances, he fell behind on several of his obligations including the $6,675 \ncredit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He acted responsibly by entering a monthly \nrepayment plan for this debt in 2018 and continuing to make timely installments. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nIn December 2013, while briefly uninsured, Applicant totaled his vehicle and \nincurred a debt for the balance due on it. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) This event occurred more than \nseven years ago under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Applicant acted \nresponsibly by attempting to resolve this debt, first with the insurance provider and then \nwith the creditor. However, he was unable to resolve the debt and it has been charged off \nby the creditor. Applicant remains willing to pay this debt. \nThe $2,837 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was a secured debt and there is \nno outstanding balance. After unsuccessfully attempting to resolve the $13,368 debt \nclaimed by an apartment complex, Applicant disputed the debt and it has been removed \nfrom his credit report. Applicant does not recognize the two medical debts totaling $1,227 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) and they do not appear on his 2019 CBR. \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThe financial issues Applicant experienced were not caused by reckless or \nirresponsible behavior. The issues are the result of a sustained period of unemployment, \na vehicle accident, and ongoing underemployment. He has resolved or is resolving more \nthan 64% of the total amount of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s credit history between 2009 \nand 2019 includes consistent repayment of personal loans, student loans, credit cards, \nand a line of credit. Although three of the SOR debts remain outstanding, the charged-\noff balance for the vehicle loan and the two medical debts that are no longer on Applicant\u2019s \nCBR are unlikely to be sources of vulnerability to coercion or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s long history of overall financial stability, his resolution of the majority of \nthe SOR debt, and his current financial circumstances are sufficient to establish a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. He is focused on proper money management which is \ndemonstrated by the fact that he has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2015. He \nlives within his means and has no open credit accounts. He acted in good faith to resolve \nhis outstanding debts by entering a repayment agreement for his credit-card debt, by \nsuccessfully disputing the apartment complex debt, and by contacting the creditor in an \neffort to resolve the vehicle-loan debt and maintaining his willingness to pay the debt. He \nestablished a plan to resolve his delinquent debts and has implemented that plan. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d) and 20(e) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably on active duty in the Navy from 2009 until 2013, \nincluding a combat deployment. He was granted his first security clearance in \napproximately 2010. His overall credit history is indicative of a person who takes his \nfinancial responsibilities seriously. He incurred delinquent debt between 2013 and 2015 \ndue to unusual circumstances that were beyond his control but he acted responsibly. \nWhile those granted access to classified information are held to a high standard of \nconduct, they are not held to a standard of perfection. Security clearance adjudications \nare not meant to be punitive but rather are to determine an applicant\u2019s current ability to \nproperly handle and protect classified information. Ultimately, the record shows that \nApplicant has demonstrated the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required \nof those granted access to classified information. \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \nissues. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 31, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on June 21, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6 1.x. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He served in the military from 1980 to 2000 and retired \nin the paygrade E-7. He married in 1981 and divorced in 1997. There are no children from \nthe marriage. He remarried in 2013 and has three stepchildren, a 15-year-old and 13-\nyear-old twins. Applicant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is close to completing a master\u2019s \ndegree. He has been continuously employed by a federal contractor since April 2013. (Tr. \n15-18) \nApplicant explained his financial difficulties began after he married in 2013. He said \nshortly after they married, he and his wife opened multiple credit accounts. He greatly \nunderestimated the amount of expenses associated with three children. Two of the \nchildren have special needs. His wife does not receive child support for the twins because \ntheir father was in the United States illegally and his whereabouts are unknown. The \neldest child also does not receive child support. Applicant\u2019s wife returned to school in \n2012 to earn a degree in health care administration to get a better job. After they were \nmarried, she became permanently disabled and could not work. Due to the timing of her \ndisability, she does not receive Social Security disability benefits. Applicant\u2019s salary is \napproximately $112,000 and his military pension is approximately $14,400. Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s student loans (approximately $77,000) were forgiven due to her disability. He \nadmitted that his poor financial planning is responsible for his financial problems. (Tr. 18-\n21, 38-39, 41) \nIn approximately 2015, Applicant began falling behind on his accounts. He \ncontacted a credit-counseling service in March 2015, but their proposed payment plan \nwas more than he could afford. He contemplated filing bankruptcy, but wanted to pay his \ndebts. He sold timeshare contracts he owned to increase his cash flow. In 2017, he \nrelocated to a new state that did not have state income taxes, the weather was therapeutic \nfor his wife, and there were more government benefits available for the children. (Tr. 21-\n22) \nApplicant admitted that he has 25 delinquent debts that are alleged in the SOR. \nHe disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x ($175) and testified it was removed from his \ncredit report. He also testified that the past-due student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and \n1.m (total balance: $88,095 and $18,467 respectively) have been refinanced and are in \na deferred status.

The total amount of the delinquent debt he owes is approximately \n$31,892, excluding the three above accounts. (Tr. 34-38) \nApplicant provided exhibits to document that he began making payments of $150 \na month in April 2019 on the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,866) and 1.h \n($824) to the same creditor. The payments were made through an automatic withdrawal. \nHe said that he decided to pay first the creditor that had the largest balance and then he \nwill work his way through the remainder of his delinquent debts. He said for some reason \nafter approximately nine months the payments stopped. He had to restart the payments. \nThe debt was for a military credit account, so his tax refund was applied to the debt. The \npayments will continue until January 2022. Applicant believed the current balance is \naround $1,500. (Tr. 22-23, 29-33; AE B) \nApplicant provided documentary evidence that the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.aa \n($832) was paid through a payment agreement that was completed in April 2019. (Tr. 26\u00ad\n27; AE D) \nApplicant provided documents to show he is making payments on a settlement \nagreement reached in response to a lawsuit filed by a creditor. He indicated the case \nwent to mediation and the amount the creditor alleged was reduced. This debt is not \nalleged in the SOR (amount of debt to be paid is $1,777 plus court costs of $243) and will \nnot be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in the whole person \nanalysis and in mitigation. The last payment due is September 2021. (Tr. 23-26; AE C) \nApplicant testified that his wife has some \u201clow-level\u201d credit cards in her own name \nthat are being paid timely. (Tr. 40) They own two vehicles (2019 and 2020). At the end of \nthe month he estimated he has a couple hundred dollars remaining. He has no savings \nor investments. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he indicated that he was making payments on \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. When questioned about its current status, he stated at the time he \ncompleted his answer to the SOR he was making payments. He is not currently making \npayments and does not know the account\u2019s status. He estimated that his out-of-pocket \nmedical expenses are approximately $4,000 annually. Applicant also stated that he \nreached out via email to another counseling service in early 2020 about establishing \npayment plans for his debts, but due to the pandemic shutdown he did not follow up on \nit. He does not have a budget. He indicated his wife was not receptive to cutting expenses. \nHe testified that he intends to pay his debts. Other than the accounts noted above, \nApplicant has not had any contact with the creditors of the remaining delinquent debts, \nand he is not making any payments towards these debts.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2015 and \nremain unpaid. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to poor financial planning after getting \nmarried in 2013 and assuming financial responsibility for three children. He and his wife \nalso acquired multiple credit accounts. These conditions were within his control. His wife\u2019s \ninability to work impacted their finances. This condition was beyond his control. For the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant resolved the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.aa through a \npayment arrangement. He is also making payments as part of a settlement from a creditor \nwho had filed a lawsuit. Paying debts after or in anticipation of a lawsuit is not responsible \naction. Although he is paying one large debt, considering the totality of the evidence, I \ncannot find he has acted responsibly or his actions can be considered a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to \nthese debts. It does apply to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h. \nApplicant contacted two credit-counseling services. With the first one he decided \nthe payment plan was unaffordable. Regarding the second, he failed to follow up with \nthem during the pandemic. There is insufficient evidence that he is receiving financial \ncounseling and that there are clear indications his financial problems are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application. Applicant disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x. I find AG \n\u00b6 20(e) applies to this debt, and it is resolved. \nApplicant does not have a budget or a realistic plan for resolving his delinquent \ndebts. He testified that his wife is reluctant to cut their expenses. I am unable to find it is \nunlikely financial issues will recur. His behavior casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 59 years old. I have considered his honorable military service. \nAlthough Applicant testified that he did not want to file bankruptcy and wants to repay his \ncreditors, he does not have a realistic plan to accomplish it. He has little expendable \nincome and an unreliable financial track record. He has not met his burden of persuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.w: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.x:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.y-1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.aa: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in 2001. He married in 2011 and has two children ages eight and four years old. He has been employed by a federal contractor since September 2018. (Tr. 16-17; GE 1; AE J, K) The SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent credit card debts totaling approximately $49,447. He stopped paying the credit cards in 2014. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he said he contacted the creditor in 2015, but has not done anything since then. He said he was expecting to receive an IRS Form 1099C, cancelation of debt, but to date had not. (Tr. 37-40; GE 1, 2, 3) Applicant testified he reached out to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c in 2015, and then again in 2018 or 2019, but claimed he could not find the current creditor. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, he said that the debt was sold to a collection agency. He was offered a settlement, but had not paid anything on the debt. He provided a copy of a settlement offer from the collection company for this debt. He has not made payments to resolve these two debts. (Tr. 40-43; AE P) Applicant admitted he owed the debt in SOR \u00b61.a ($21,059) and he defaulted on it in 2014. He provided a copy of a news article and an administrative proceeding consent order from 2015 against ",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 15, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations.

On May 14, 2021, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the \nhearing via the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) system. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on June 23, 2021. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. \nApplicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through P. There were no \nobjections and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. The record remained open until \nJuly 7, 2021, to allow additional documents to be submitted. None were and the record \nclosed. DOHA received the hearing transcript on July 2, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2001. He married in 2011 and has two children ages eight and four years old. \nHe has been employed by a federal contractor since September 2018. (Tr. 16-17; GE 1; \nAE J, K) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent credit card debts totaling \napproximately $49,447. He stopped paying the credit cards in 2014. Regarding the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b, he said he contacted the creditor in 2015, but has not done anything since \nthen. He said he was expecting to receive an IRS Form 1099C, cancelation of debt, but \nto date had not. (Tr. 37-40; GE 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant testified he reached out to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c in 2015, and then \nagain in 2018 or 2019, but claimed he could not find the current creditor. Regarding the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, he said that the debt was sold to a collection agency. He was offered \na settlement, but had not paid anything on the debt. He provided a copy of a settlement \noffer from the collection company for this debt. He has not made payments to resolve \nthese two debts. (Tr. 40-43; AE P) \nApplicant admitted he owed the debt in SOR \u00b61.a ($21,059) and he defaulted on \nit in 2014. He provided a copy of a news article and an administrative proceeding consent \norder from 2015 against the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The order was issued by the United \nStates Consumer Protection Bureau for harmful practices by the creditor in violation of \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Act. The order applied to the time period January 1, \n2009, through June 30, 2014, for any pre-judgment collection litigation matters that were \npending during the time period; collection litigation matters where a judgment was \nobtained; and any court judgment that the creditor had obtained against the consumer \nthrough collection litigation. Applicant testified that the creditor did not initiate a lawsuit \nagainst him. He said he validated the debt in 2019 by contacting the original creditor \nseeking a settlement agreement. He provided a document from December 2019 from the \ncreditor confirming a settlement agreement offer, where if Applicant agreed to settle the \ndebt the payments would be $527 a month from December 2019 to November 2020, with \nthe total amount to be paid of $6,324. No payments were made. Applicant testified that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to extensive damage sustained to his \nhouse during a 2005 hurricane, which required major repairs. His homeowners insurance \nonly paid a fraction of the amount and then it went bankrupt. He estimated the costs he \nincurred, not paid by insurance, was approximately $20,000, or more. He said he had to \nuse credit cards to pay for the repairs. In 2008, his house depreciated due to the housing \nmarket, and his mortgage payments increased because he had an interest-only loan. His \nhomeowner association fees also increased. In 2012, he sold the house and paid the \nmortgage, but lost the amount he had put down as a deposit. (Tr. 18-24; AE A) \n \n \nIn 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife became pregnant with their first child. She had \ncomplications. She was working at the time in a job that required her to travel. She had \nto stop working due to the stress. After the birth of the child, she did not go back to work.  \nLater their child had medical issues and they visited multiple doctors. Their child was \ndiagnosed with autism and then later with another medical issue that required surgery. \nHe had health insurance, but there were extra medical expenses that he paid that were \nnot covered. He testified that his son\u2019s surgery was in 2015. His son\u2019s other medical \nissues were resolved around 2016 or 2017. The child attends a private school that meets \nhis special needs. (Tr. 24-28, 60-62, 71-72; AE B, C, D, E) \n \n \n \nhe was told he would be issued an IRS Form 1099C, cancellation of debt for this debt. \nHe said he lost communication with the creditor. He believes his debt is included in the \nabove consent order. Applicant may have a legal defense if it was deemed that his debt \nfell within the parameters of this order. His credit reports from April 2019 and February \n2020 reflect the debt was charged off by the credit grantor and in collection. (Tr. 32-37, \n73; GE 2, 3; AE F, N, O) \nApplicant\u2019s wife has been working part-time for about eight or nine months, earning \nabout $1,500 a month. Applicant earns about $132,000 annually. He participated in credit \ncounseling in January 2020 that was approximately an hour long. A debt repayment plan \nwas not prepared. He does not have a written budget. He said he contacted a debt \nconsolidation company in 2018, but the fees associated with its proposed plan were \nprohibitive, and he decided to address the problem on his own. He said his finances are \nstable, and he is financially responsible. He testified that more recently he has been trying \nto address his delinquent debts, but wants to be confident he is paying the correct creditor. \nHe said he will wait for an IRS Form 1099C to be sent to him and then settle the matters \nwith the IRS. He did not offer any substantive evidence of efforts he made to pay these \ncreditors. He noted that if he initiated contact with a creditor, because of the age of the \ndebt, it could restart the clock for the statute of limitations. (Tr. 24-25, 28, 45-60, 63-67; \nAE G, H) \nApplicant purchased a new home in February 2021 for $379,000. He put a down \npayment of $15,000. He testified the down payment was from money he saved. He and \nhis family traveled to Europe to visit family in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018.

He \nis well-liked by his teammates and is considered a man of integrity. (AE I, J, K, M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has four credit card debts that have been delinquent since 2014 and are \nunresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a 2005 hurricane that caused \nextensive damage to his house. His insurance company paid little and then went \nbankrupt. He paid approximately $20,000 or more to repair his home. This was beyond \nhis control. He had an interest-only loan, and his payments began to increase. He sold \nhis home in 2012. He did not make a profit. This financial decision was within his control. \nHe chose the type of loan to obtain and when to sell the house. The loss of his wife\u2019s \nincome because of medical issues due to her 2012 pregnancy was beyond his control. \nHis child\u2019s out-of-pocket medical expenses were beyond his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant must show he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant used his credit cards to help pay his expenses. He stopped \npaying them in 2014. He has been aware that his debts are a security concern since \n2019. Although he has made gestures towards resolving his debts, he has not done \nanything substantively to make payments. He appears to be in a wait and see mode, but \nhas not taken action. He is aware that these debts are all seven years old and likely will \nbe removed from his credit report. They may be uncollectable due to the statute of \nlimitation or other legal defenses, but his conduct shows he has disregarded and \nneglected paying legitimate debts he incurred. This does not show he acted responsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and ongoing. He had financial counseling, but there \nis scant evidence that his financial problems and debts are being resolved. He has not \nmade a good-faith payment to pay his overdue creditors. There is insufficient evidence to \nfully apply the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c) or 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He began experiencing financial problems in 2005 and \nhad other life events occur that impacted his finances. He used credit cards to pay his \nbills, but stopped paying them in 2014 and owes more than $49,000 that remains unpaid. \nAt this juncture, he has an unreliable financial track record, and he has not met his burden \nof persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 25, 2021, and the hearing was held as scheduled on June 30, \n2021 (Applicant waived the 15-days\u2019 notice provision; See hearing transcript (Tr.) 9-10). \nThis hearing was convened as scheduled using the Defense Collaboration Services \n(DCS) video teleconferencing capabilities. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, which were admitted into evidence without objection, except for GE 2, which \nwas objected to, but admitted for limited weight. The Government\u2019s pre-hearing discovery \nletter and exhibit list were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified but \nhe did not offer any documentary exhibits. The record remained open until July 16, 2021, \nbut no additional evidence was submitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJuly 8, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations, except for SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, which he partially denied, and amended SOR \u00b6 1.h. His admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He has worked for his contractor-employer for \napproximately three years. He is an avionics specialist. He has a high school diploma and \nhas taken some college courses. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2001 to 2005, but \nwas given a general discharge, under honorable conditions because of drug use. He is \ndivorced and has two children. (Tr. 6, 25, 28-30, 35; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana at various times from July 2000 to July \n2017; that in 2005, he was punished under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) for wrongful use of marijuana under Article 112a, resulting in an \ninvoluntary discharge from the Air Force; that he was arrested in approximately March \n2006, May 2013, and July 2017 for unlawful possession of marijuana; that in December \n2016, he was fired from his job for fighting with another employee; and that in August \n2015, he arrested for wrongful possession of drug paraphernalia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h) \nMarijuana use July 2000-July 2017 (SOR 1.a). Applicant admitted that his \nmarijuana use started while in high school in approximately 2000 when he used it \napproximately 10 times before joining the Air Force in 2001. He admitted his pre-service \ndrug use upon enlistment in the Air Force. He then used marijuana approximately one or \ntwo times in 2001 or 2002 when he was in the Air Force. He realizes he made a mistake \nby doing that while in the Air Force. He knew it was wrong at the time. He also admitted \nusing marijuana at various times after the Air Force up to approximately 2013. There were \nalso significant periods when he went without using marijuana, such as when he was on \nprobation for the offense listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 30-31, 33, 36-37, 54; GE 2) \nArticle 15, UCMJ action in March 2005 (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana while in the Air Force. He was at a social setting with some friends.

He realizes that it was a bad \ndecision to hang around the people he was with at the time. (Tr. 30-33) \nAggravated assault offense in November 2005 (SOR 1.c). Applicant admitted \nto a brief but tumultuous relationship with his ex-wife. He claims that they had an \nargument that turned physical when his ex-wife cut him with some glass and he picked \nup the nearest object, which was a clothes iron, and struck her in the head. He was \narrested and charged with aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty under a diversion \nprogram and was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, inter alia. He successfully complied \nwith the terms of the diversion. This incident led to the separation and divorce between \nApplicant and his ex-wife. He has had no further incidents connected to her. (Tr. 38-41; \nGE 3) \nArrest for wrongful possession of marijuana in March 2006 (SOR 1.d). \nApplicant admitted that he was stopped by the police on a warrant related to the \naggravated assault. He was searched, found in possession of marijuana, and arrested. \nHe pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months\u2019 probation, one day in jail, fines and \ncosts. (Tr. 42-43; AE 3) \nArrest for wrongful possession of marijuana in May 2013 (SOR 1.e). Applicant \nadmitted that he was driving and was stopped by the police. He was found in possession \nof some marijuana. He was arrested, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to six months\u2019 \nprobation, one day in jail, and fines and fees. He testified that this was the last time he \nused marijuana. (Tr. 44; AE 3) \nFired from a job because of a fight with another employee while on the job \nin December 2016 (SOR 1.f). Applicant believed a coworker was not performing his job \nas he should and discussed this with a supervisor. The other employee was made aware \nof Applicant\u2019s actions and confronted him. Later in the day, the other employee struck \nApplicant with a key close to his eye and a physical altercation resulted. Both Applicant \nand the other employee were fired from their positions. Applicant realized he was wrong \nfor physically engaging the other employee, even though he acted in self-defense. The \ncompany had a zero-tolerance policy concerning workplace fights. Although he was fired, \nhe received a strong recommendation from this company for his next position. (Tr. 45-47; \nAE 3) \n3 \nArrest for wrongful possession of marijuana in July 2017 (SOR 1.g). Applicant \nwas a passenger in a friend\u2019s car when they were stopped at a city park. They were there \nafter the park closed at 10 pm. A police car arrived and then approached the car Applicant \nwas in. A search of the vehicle revealed the presence of a small amount of marijuana. \nApplicant claimed he had no knowledge of the marijuana\u2019s presence in the vehicle. He \nbelieved he was charged with possession of marijuana and the charges were dropped \nafter spending a night in jail. His friend was also charged with possession of marijuana. \nHe still associates with this friend who he has known since second grade. His friend does \nnot use any drugs around Applicant anymore. Court records show that Applicant received \na citation for possession of drug paraphernalia on July 22, 2017, which was ultimately \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndismissed after a deferred disposition in January 2018. There are no court records \nshowing that Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession anytime in July 2017. It \nappears Applicant was mistaken about the nature of his arrest. (Tr. 47-48, 51-52; AE 3) \nArrest for wrongful possession of drug paraphernalia in August 2015 \n(Amended SOR 1.h). Applicant was driving his vehicle and was stopped by the police for \na traffic violation. A search revealed the presence of drug paraphernalia. He denied \nknowledge of its presence or its ownership. He believes a friend left it in the car. He longer \nassociates with this friend. Court documents show that he pleaded no contest to the \ncitation and paid the associated fine and fees. The case was closed in December 2015. \n(Tr. 48-49, 53; GE 5) \nStarting with providing his criminal history in his security clearance application, \nApplicant was forthcoming with the significant details of his arrests and has accepted \nresponsibility for his actions. He stated that in 2013, he examined his life and saw that \nusing marijuana was causing him financial and job-related problems. That is when he \ndecided to stop using marijuana. He stated his willingness to remove himself from any \nfriends who continue to use drugs. I found his testimony to be credible. (Tr. 26, 51, 53; \nGE 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s sporadic use of marijuana over time, his Article 15 for marijuana use in \nthe Air Force, his arrests associated with marijuana, his aggravated assault charge, and \nhis job termination for fighting all reflect poor judgment and raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Based upon the general personal conduct \nsecurity concern, AG 15 is raised by the evidence. \n5 \n \nIn analyzing the applicability of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG 16, I \nconclude that they do not specifically apply to the facts here. AG 16(a) and 16(b) do not \napply because this case does not involve allegations of falsification. AG 16(c) does not \napply because the government had sufficient information for an adverse determination \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse; and Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, but chose not to allege the conduct as such. AG 16(d) does not apply because \nthe conduct alleged could be specifically covered under Guidelines H and J. Perhaps the \nfighting on the job allegation (SOR 1.d) could be construed as a rules violation or \ndisruptive behavior under AG 16(d)(2)(3), however, that behavior also is already covered \nby the general concern stated in AG 15 (questionable judgment and rules non-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance), therefore, it is unnecessary to restate it. AG 16(e) is not applicable because \nApplicant was forthcoming about his conduct during the clearance investigative process \nthereby eliminating any concern that he might be subject to manipulation, exploitation or \nput under duress because of his past misconduct history. AG 16(f) and 16(g) were not \nspecifically alleged and therefore not applicable. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAppellant\u2019s use of marijuana ended in 2013. He was cited in 2015 and 2017, but \ncredibly claimed no involvement with marijuana, other than being with friends who had it. \nThe 2017 marijuana possession charge was not established because the court records \nrefer to a paraphernalia arrest, which was not alleged. He has stated his intent to not \nassociate with those friends in the future. His aggravated assault offense occurred 15 \nyears ago and there have been no similar incidents. He acted in self-defense when he \nfought with a coworker on the job and realizes that was a mistake. These actions are \nremote in time and were under unique circumstances such that similar behavior is unlikely \nto recur. I am convinced that Applicant has learned from these past experiences and his \nconduct does not cast doubt on his future reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c), 17(d), and substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s forthrightness \nand acceptance of responsibility for his past actions. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 28, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA) seeking a clearance. (Government Exhibit (GE) 1.) On November 22, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the above three \nadjudicative guidelines. The DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec.

He requested \na hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On March 28, 2020, the case was assigned to me. The hearing on the case was \ndelayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 2, \n2020, scheduling the hearing on November 17, 2020. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented ten \nproposed exhibits, marked as GE 1 through 10. I marked his exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit \nI. Applicant\u2019s counsel had no objections to admissibility of GE 1, 2, and 4-10. He objected \nto admission of GE 3, a Polygraph Report summarizing admissions made by Applicant in \na polygraph examination conducted in 2013 by an examiner of the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (CBP). Applicant\u2019s counsel offered 12 exhibits, marked as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through L. Department Counsel did not object to any of these proposed \nexhibits. I admitted all exhibits, except GE 3. I reserved my decision on the admissibility \nof that exhibit until the issuance of this Decision. See my ruling below. (Tr. at 8, 10-16.) \nEvidentiary Ruling on GE 3 \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of GE 3 on the grounds that it \ncontained inaccurate hearsay information and that no witness was present to confirm the \nauthenticity and accuracy of the information set forth in the polygraph examination \nsummary. Department Counsel argued that the report is not subject to the exception on \nadmissibility set forth in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and is therefore admissible hearsay. I agree \nwith Department Counsel\u2019s argument. I find that GE 3 is not a DoD Report of Investigation. \nIt contains only \u201cadjudicatively significant information\u201d and no \u201cpolygraph examination \ntechnical calls.\u201d (SEAD 4, Appendix A, Section 1(c)). It is an official record of CBP, Office \nof Internal Affairs, Credibility Assessment Division, on official letterhead and marked \u201cFor \nOfficial Use Only\u2013Law Enforcement Sensitive.\u201d Official documents such as this are \nroutinely admissible in DOHA proceedings under the \u201cofficial record\u201d hearsay exception \nof Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8). (Tr. at 13-15.) \nI conclude that GE 3 is admissible under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and the Appeal Board \ndecision in ISCR Case No. 11-12641 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013), which was upheld by the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. See Palmieri v. United States, No. 16-\n5347 at 11-14 (D.C. Cir. 2018) affirming the U.S. District Court\u2019s summary judgment \nagainst the appellant. Palmieri v. United States, 72 F.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, \nand the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant, 34, is married and has two young children. He received a high school \ndiploma in 2004 and has taken some college courses, but he has not earned a degree. \nIn December 2008, he received a Correctional Academy Certificate. (Tr. at 17.) \nStarting in 2009 at age 19, Applicant sought a position in law enforcement, \nspecifically with CBP. At that time, it was important to him work in that field. In 2009, he \nsubmitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing (e-QIP) seeking \nemployment with CBP. After taking a polygraph examination in July 2013, he was advised \nthat he was not going to be considered. He testified that he never inquired why he was \ndisqualified. He testified that at the point, he had \u201calready invested myself into the career \nI am currently at now.\u201d (Tr. at 17-20, 25, 58-61, 73.) \nIn November 2012, Applicant began his career working as a contractor for the U.S. \nNavy performing ship repairs. In about February 2018, he started working for his current \nemployer in the same field. Initially, he took a pay cut of about $10,000 because he \nbelieved that he would advance quickly and would ultimately earn a higher income. He \nhas since been promoted to be a site manager and a level-one supervisor for this \ncompany, a Navy contractor, which is sponsoring Applicant to apply for a security \nclearance. According to Applicant, he presently has an interim clearance. (Tr. at 18-20, \n25, 58-61, 68.) \nFinancial Considerations \nIn September 2012, Applicant began to experience financial difficulties after his \nwife was laid off. She was pregnant at the time with their first child. She lost her annual \nincome of $40,000 to $50,000. As a result, Applicant and his family had to live solely on \nhis income, which was $70,000 to $75,000. In the following months, Applicant was unable \nto pay his bills. On the advice of an attorney, he filed for bankruptcy on May 13, 2013, \nunder Chapter 7. (GE 2 at 3; GE 8 at 1-4; AE H; Tr. at 20-22.) \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s 2013 bankruptcy, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts \nowed to a credit union, two credit-card accounts and one loan opened by Applicant to \nconsolidate his debts. He opened these accounts after his bankruptcy discharge, hoping \nto reestablish his prior solid credit. The Government\u2019s evidence reflects that the three \ndebts became delinquent in mid-2016. Applicant testified that at that time, he was not \nmaking enough money to pay his bills. He was earning about $75,000 per year. (GE 5 at \n3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 10 at 2; Tr. at 23, 31-33, 54.) \nAs described generally above and alleged in the SOR, Applicant has the following \nthree delinquent debts owed to a credit union: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - Credit-Card Account in the amount of $20,304. Applicant opened this \naccount in August 2013, the same month as his bankruptcy discharge. The credit limit on \nthe account was $19,300. He defaulted on this account in 2016. In late 2018, he received \na promotion and a pay raise. In February 2019, he entered into a payment plan with the \ncredit union to repay this debt at the monthly rate of $100. At the time, he was earning a \nhigher salary and could afford to begin paying his three debts owed to the credit union. \nThe payment plan for this debt is scheduled to continue for 202 months, or about 17 \nyears. Applicant provided documentation from the creditor evidencing his compliance with \nhis payment plan. He intends to begin paying this debt off sooner with funds from a merit \npay raise he expects to receive soon and with excess money he will have once his other \ndebts to the credit union are paid off. This debt is being resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at \n2; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 3; Tr. at 22-28.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b - Debt-Consolidation Loan Account in the amount of $7,486. Applicant \nopened this account in October 2015. He defaulted on this account in May 2016, about \nseven months later. Again in February 2019, he entered into a payment plan with the \ncredit union to repay this debt at the monthly rate of $100 for 77 months. He provided \ndocumentation from the creditor evidencing his compliance with his payment plan. He \nplans to increase his monthly payments with his next pay raise. This debt is being \nresolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 1; Tr. at 27-28.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c - Credit-Card Account in the amount of $3,319. Applicant opened this \naccount in September 2015. He defaulted on the debt in May 2016. Since March 2019, \nhe has been paying the creditor $50 per month. He provided documentation reflecting his \npayments and current status under the payment plan. He intends to repay the entire \namount more quickly than the 68 months provided for under the plan. This debt is being \nresolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 2; Tr. at 29.) \nThe fourth allegation under Guideline F in the SOR is the following: \nSOR \u00b6 1.d - 2013 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition. Applicant filed his petition in May \n2013. He listed about $35,000 of unsecured debts and $39,000 of secured debts, which \nwere debts on two vehicles. He returned the two vehicles to the lenders, and his \nunsecured debts and the balances of the auto loans were discharged in August 2013. As \nexplained above, he was unable to pay his debts in 2013 because his wife had lost her \njob and he was unable to pay the family expenses without her income. (GE 8 at 1-2; AE \nH; Tr. at 30-31, 46, 54-55, 80-81.) \nApplicant considers himself financially stable, and he works hard to live within his \nmeans. He has taken a financial-counseling class online that taught financial planning, \nbudgeting, and investments. As a result of his past financial problems, he has learned to \nbudget his expenses and avoid overspending. He uses a computerized bill-pay system \nto plan and track his spending. Aside from the above three debts, he pays off his debts \nevery month and has zero balances. Applicant testified that his wife is now reemployed, \nand she uses her income to pay some small bills. She has no separate debts and has \ngood credit. His annual income has increased to approximately $91,000, and his wife \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nearns another $55,000 to $60,000. He also has a retirement account with about $43,000 \nin assets. He maintains a savings account with about $3,500 to $4,000 for emergencies. \n(AE D; AE F; Tr. at 23, 31-34, 49-54.) \nDrug Involvement \nApplicant testified that the last time he used any illegal drugs was in 2004. He was \na senior in high school at the time. His use of marijuana was experimental. He no longer \nassociates with his high school friends who used marijuana with him. He always avoids \nenvironments where drug use might occur. In addition, he has signed a statement of intent \nin which he pledged never to use any illegal drugs in the future. He has also tested \nnegative for drug use for seven or eight months preceding the hearing. In addition, he \ncompleted an online, drug-counseling course. He has no intent to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture because he does not approve of them, and with his two children, he wants to set \nthe right example for them. (AE J; AE K; AE L; Tr. at 35-38.) \nAs noted, Applicant aspired to work in law enforcement. He aggressively pursued \nthis career goal for three years. He applied for a position with the CBP in 2009. He testified \nthat the hiring process took an unusually long time, in part, due to a hiring freeze at CBP. \nHe also testified that he was randomly tested for illegal drug use and no longer used any \nillegal drugs while his application was pending. One of the last requirements of the \napplication process was a polygraph exam, which he took in July 2013. (GE 1 at 13; GE \n2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 37; Tr. at 40-44, 66, 69, 73, 75-78, 86-88.) \nBy that point, Applicant had settled in a new career as a Navy contractor beginning \nin November 2012. He no longer dreamed of working in law enforcement after his son \nwas born in September 2012 and his wife was unemployed. Nevertheless, he took the \nCBP polygraph in July 2013. As set forth in the examiner\u2019s Polygraph Report, Applicant \nadmitted during the examination that he used marijuana approximately 20 times between \n2000 and August 2012. Accordingly, his first use was while in high school and his last use \nwas about one year before the polygraph. (GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 37; \nTr. at 40-44, 66, 69, 73, 75-78, 86-88.) \nApplicant also admitted to the examiner that he purchased marijuana on about \nthree occasions. At the hearing, he provided no testimony disputing the accuracy of GE \n3 with respect to this statement regarding purchasing marijuana. (GE 3 at 1.) \nApplicant, however, disputes the accuracy of GE 3 on one critical point. He testified \nthat he told the examiner that he only used marijuana during the period 2004 to 2005. \nThe examiner asked him to provide a range of the dates of use, and Applicant responded \nwith this range just so that he would \u201cmake myself look better. I had never done a \npolygraph.\u201d He testified that he subsequently received a letter from CBP stating that he \nwas \u201cdisqualified\u201d for employment with that agency. While disappointed, he testified that \nhe was \u201cin a better place\u201d at the time he received the CBP letter. He had already started \nworking in his new career field.

He \nsubsequently testified that the disqualification letter advised him that he was not being \nconsidered for employment at CBP because he did not initially tell the truth about his \nmarijuana use on his 2009 e-QIP. (Tr. at 76-77.) The letter explained further that he \nadmitted in his polygraph that his marijuana use was more extensive than three times in \n2004, which is what he disclosed in his e-QIP. In his testimony, he denied that the \ndisqualification letter referred to drug use as recent as 2012. Moreover, he denied ever \ntelling the examiner that his last use was in August 2012. He cannot explain why that date \nappears in GE 3. The first time he saw GE 3 was after the issuance of the SOR when he \nrequested his investigative file.

He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to a question in Section 23 regarding \ndrug use in the past seven years. The SOR alleges that he intentionally provided a false \nresponse to this question.

At the hearing, \nApplicant testified that, other than the admission relating to marijuana, the admissions \nsummarized in GE 3 were accurate. Applicant denies, however, that GE 3 is accurate \nwith respect to the period of time he admitted to using marijuana, i.e., 2000 to August \n2012.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains seven potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. Two of the conditions apply to the facts found in this case: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and his testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions. \nAccordingly, further review is required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of the conditions potentially apply to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nMitigating conditions 20(a) and (b) partially apply. Applicant\u2019s 2013 bankruptcy \noccurred a number of years ago and was caused by the unusual circumstance of his \nwife\u2019s loss of employment when she was pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child. This was \nalso a condition largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Standing alone, these circumstances \ndo not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant, \nhowever, incurred $30,000 of new debts in the three years after his bankruptcy discharge \nthat he could not afford. These debts, which are ongoing, make it difficult to conclude that \nhis financial problems are unlikely to recur. He has, however, successfully put new \nbudgeting and spending control measures in place. His responsible behavior in 2019, \nprior to the issuance of the SOR, of entering into payment plans with the creditor of his \nthree delinquent debts and of consistently making payments for almost two years under \nthose plans demonstrate that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nMitigating condition 20(c) fully applies. Applicant has received online credit \ncounseling and has taken the lessons he learned to heart. He has created a serious \nbudget and controls his spending so that his mistakes in the period 2013 to 2016 are not \nrepeated. With his history of compliance with his payment plans to repay the three SOR \ndebts and his serious efforts to live within his means, Applicant has provided clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. \nMitigating condition 20(d) partially applies. Applicant did not repay the creditors to \nwhich he was indebted at the time of his bankruptcy filing. He has, however, initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay his three most recent delinquent debts and has faithfully adhered \nto his repayment plans for almost two years. \n9 \n \nOverall, Applicant has maturely managed his finances since 2019. He has met his \nburden to establish mitigation of the allegations raised in the SOR concerning financial \nconsiderations.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG & 25 contains seven potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. One condition applies to the facts found in this case: \nAG & 25 (a): any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant used marijuana approximately 20 \ntimes between 2000 and August 2012. Under the pressure of his first polygraph \nexamination, Applicant made more forthcoming admissions about his past marijuana use \nthat he had on his 2009 e-QIP. Also, when he took the polygraph, he was no longer \nseriously pursuing a career with CBP. He testified that with the birth of his first child in \n2012, he had made the decision to find a new career. In November 2012, he commenced \nworking for a U.S. military contractor. At the time Applicant took the polygraph in July \n2013, he was invested in his new career. His testimony revealed that answering the \nquestions completely and honestly was important to him. A possible job opportunity with \nCBP was no longer his career ambition. \nThe Examination Summary prepared by a polygraph examiner in the Credibility \nAssessment Division of the CBP\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs is highly credible. The \nExamination Summary was prepared by a trained U.S. Government employee and this \ncritical statement about Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is the first item listed under the heading \n\u201cRelevant Admissions.\u201d Since this admission is the most derogatory information in the \nSummary, it would be expected that the examiner was especially carefully in preparing \nthis portion of his report. Applicant admitted that all of the other information in the exhibit \nwas correctly summarized. There is no reason to believe that the polygraph examiner \nprovided erroneous information, either intentionally or inadvertently, about the dates \nApplicant admitted using marijuana. Moreover, Federal officials such as the polygraph \nexaminer are entitled to a presumption of good faith in the conduct of their duties. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 11-05079 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012); ISCR Case No. 11-12641 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013). \n10 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant made a full, truthful disclosure of his past illegal drug use to the polygraph \nexaminer. I find his statements to the examiner to be accurately summarized. In making \nmy conclusion that Applicant used marijuana until 2012, I have given careful \nconsideration to Applicant\u2019s testimony disputing the accuracy of that date set forth in GE \n3. I find that Applicant\u2019s testimony denying his illegal drug use after 2004 lacked credibility. \nThis was not the first time Applicant tried to minimize or falsify his past drug use in a \nsecurity clearance application to help his career. In light of my conclusion that Applicant \nhas used marijuana in the past, further review is required. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. Two of the conditions potentially \napply: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s last use \nof marijuana occurred about eight years ago, and his use was infrequent. Accordingly, \nhis past use of marijuana does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. In addition, he has acknowledged, in general, his past drug use, and has \nestablished a long period of abstinence. He avoids friends and situations where drugs \nmight be used. He has also provided a signed statement pursuant to AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nGuideline H security concerns are resolved in favor of Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline at AG & 16 contains seven potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. One condition potentially applies to the facts found in this \ncase: \nAG & 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe record evidence established that Applicant falsified his response to a question \nin Section 23 of his December 2017 SCA regarding his illegal drug use during the prior \nseven years. Applicant failed to disclose his drug use during the period December 2010 \nto August 2012. I conclude this omission was deliberate because he admitted using drugs \nduring that period in his 2013 polygraph examination. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. Accordingly, \nfurther review is required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct. Two of the conditions potentially \napply: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \n12 \n \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions are established. The adverse \ninformation regarding Applicant\u2019s drug use from 2000 to August 2012 is substantiated by \nGE 3, a reliable and accurate source. Applicant\u2019s testimony denying this information \nlacked credibility and was insufficient to raise questions about the accuracy and reliability \nof the information. The offense of falsification is not minor, and only three years have \npassed since he signed his SCA. In light of his further denials at the hearing, which I \nfound to be not credible, it is likely this behavior will recur. His lack of candor in his SCA \nand at the hearing cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E security concerns are resolved against Applicant. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant \nadditional comments. Applicant has matured and overcome many of his past mistakes. \nHe has a job with significant responsibilities. His character evidence is impressive. He \nprovided significant evidence in mitigation of security concerns under Guidelines F and \nH. He was unsuccessful, however, in establishing that the information in the CBP \npolygraph report was incorrect. Furthermore, his testimony that he did not use marijuana \nas recently as 2012 was not credible. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines F, H, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guidelines \nF and H, but did not mitigate concerns under Guideline E raised by his deliberate omission \nin his 2017 SCA of information regarding his past use of an illegal drug. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3. Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the entire record, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is denied. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 21, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He \nresponded to those interrogatories on October 7, 2019. On November 21, 2019, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified \n(Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and detailed \nreasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nApplicant\u2019s first Answer to the SOR, dated December 27, 2019 (First Answer), was \nrejected because he failed to specifically admit or deny each allegation. In a notarized \nstatement, dated March 24, 2020 (Second Answer), Applicant again responded to the \nSOR, and he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on May 16, 2020. The case was \nassigned to me on July 14, 2020. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 19, 2020. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on September 24, 2020. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 13, and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through AE AB were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 19, 2020. I kept the record open \nuntil October 23, 2020, to enable him to supplement it. He took advantage of that \nopportunity and timely submitted numerous documents, many of which were duplicates \nof documents already in evidence. The new documents were marked and admitted as AE \nAC through AE BA without objection.

(AE J) \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86, dated June 21, 2017); GE 5 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August 2, 2017); GE \n6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 3, 2019); GE 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nAugust 19, 2020); GE 8 (Statement, dated February 23, 2004); GE 13 (Response to \nInterrogatories, dated October 7, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated \nDecember 27, 2019, and March 24, 2020. \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having one delinquent account that he \nclaimed that he had never opened. He denied having any other delinquent accounts \nwithin the past seven years. When he was interviewed by an investigator from the US. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in June 2016, he acknowledged the one account \nlisted in his SF 86, as well as some medical bills that his health insurance should have \npaid. Even after being confronted, he denied knowing anything about nearly a dozen other \ndelinquent accounts. In November 2017, while again being questioned by an OPM \ninvestigator, he acknowledged the medical bills as well as two other delinquent accounts. \nDuring a June 2018 OPM interview, he added several additional delinquents to the \ndiscussion. \nApplicant has experienced periodic financial difficulties at least since early 2004 \nwhen he had an automobile involuntarily repossessed after he lost a job and was unable \nto pay his bills. (GE 13, at 16) In February 2004, he reported that he had six delinquent \naccounts totaling over $9,000. (GE 8 (Personal Financial Statement)) In addition, he \nattributed some of his financial problems to having to make $1,700 in monthly child-\nsupport payments. Although he experienced a number of short-term periods of \nunemployment between positions, he did not focus on any specific factors that rendered \nhim unable to maintain his accounts in a current status. He offered no evidence of ever \nreceiving financial counseling. Instead, aside for a few delinquent accounts that were \napparently addressed by him prior to the issuance of the SOR in November 2019, as well \nas those described below, commencing in June 2020, he engaged the services of a credit-\nrepair firm, and they disputed a variety of accounts without specifying the basis for the \ndisputes. (AE M) He terminated his relationship with the firm and started addressing his \ncreditors individually by himself. \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,165, set forth \nas follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: There is an income tax lien in the amount of $3,214 that was filed \nagainst him in December 2018. (GE 2) The lien resulted in confusion over income as an \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindependent contractor under a Form 1099, without withholding. When the issue was \nbrought to his attention, he established a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS), but failed to do so separately with the local government. (Tr. at 84-86) In \nJune 2020, seven months after the SOR was issued, Appellant and the office of tax and \nrevenue established an Installment Agreement under which Applicant agreed to start to \nmake monthly payments in the amount of $35.17 on August 1, 2020, and every month \nthereafter until the tax liability is paid in full. He submitted documentation to confirm that \nhe has been in compliance with the Installment Agreement. (AE T; AE AR) The account \nis in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: There are condominium association assessments for the period \nJanuary 1, 2018, through October 3, 2019, totaling $7,619. (GE 13, at 13-16) After he \nwas sued, but before the trial date, in October 2019, Applicant and the creditor agreed to \na Settlement Agreement under which he agreed to make a lump-sum payment of $3,000 \non or before October 31, 2019. He made that payment on the due date. (AE F; AE AG) \nThe account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.: There is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $108 that was \nplaced for collection. (GE 6, at 1; GE 7, at 2) In April 2020, Applicant and the collection \nagent agreed that Applicant would deposit a post-dated check for the unpaid balance plus \na $10 fee on or by April 10, 2020. He actually paid the agreed amount on May 29, 2020, \nsix months after the SOR was issued. (AE AF; AE S) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: There is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $561 that was \nplaced for collection. (GE 6, at 2) Applicant paid the collection agent on October 5, 2020, \n11 months after the SOR was issued, and over a week after the hearing took place. (AE \nAA; AE AJ; AE AL) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.: There is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $1,129 that was \nplaced for collection. (GE 6, at 2) In August 2020, nine months after the SOR was issued, \nApplicant and the collection agent agreed to a repayment plan under which he would \nmake a $20 payment on August 21, 2020, and every month thereafter he would make \ntwo preauthorized recurring $20 payments until the outstanding balance is satisfied in \nJuly 2021. (AE R; AE AH; AE AI) The account is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.: There is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $4,773 that \nwas charged off. (GE 6, at 3; GE 7, at 4; GE 5, 7; AE AM) In September 2020, ten months \nafter the SOR was issued, Applicant and the creditor agreed to a repayment plan under \nwhich, starting on the 18th of each month, he would make a $20 payment until the account \nis paid in full. (AE AM) He submitted documentation indicating that the initial payment was \nmade on September 18, 2020, one week before the hearing. (AE AN) The account is in \nthe process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g.: There is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,503 that \nwas charged off, (GE 6, at 3; GE 7, at 4) In July 2020, eight months after the SOR was \nissued, Applicant and the collection agent agreed to a repayment plan under which, \nstarting on October 2, 2020, he would make monthly payments of $50 until the account \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis paid in full. (AE Q; AE AS; AE AZ) The account is in the very early process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.: There is a furniture-store charge account with an unpaid balance of \n$2,085 that was placed for collection. (GE 6, at 3; GE 7, at 4) After he was sued, but \nbefore the trial date, in February 2020, Applicant and the collection agent agreed to a \nSettlement Agreement under which they agreed to settle the account with a lump-sum \npayment of $1,220 to be made by March 5, 2020. That payment was made in February \n2020, and the collection agent considered the account to be settled in full. (AE H; AE L) \nThe account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i.: There is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,661 that \nwas placed for collection. (GE 6, at 4-5; GE 7, at 5) After he was sued, but before the trial \ndate, in September 2020, Applicant and the collection agent agreed to a Settlement \nAgreement under which they agreed to settle the account with a lump-sum payment of \n$1,330 to be made by September 18, 2020. Applicant submitted a Notice of Dismissal, \ndated September 22, 2020, indicating that the lawsuit had been dismissed as paid and \nsatisfied. (AE C; AE O; AE AE) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j.: There is a clothing-store charge account with an unpaid balance of \n$512 that was charged off. (GE 6, at 4; GE 7, at 3; GE 5, at 8) Applicant made a payment \nof $384 in settlement of the account on May 29, 2020. (AE AO; AE AQ). The account has \nbeen resolved. \nIn addition to the SOR debts discussed above, Applicant had delinquent accounts \nwith other creditors, most of which he started to resolve in 2020. (AE K; AE N; AE P; AE \nU; AE AY) \nAs noted above, Applicant has received an offer from a new employer for a position \nof senior network engineer with a starting annual salary of $160,000. That would increase \nhis annual salary substantially from his current $133,900 annual salary. Prior to the \nhearing, he reported his net monthly income from his current employer is approximately \n$6,682, and his anticipated net monthly income from his new employer would be $9,357. \nAfter his routine monthly expenses and pre-hearing debt payments, he anticipated having \na monthly remainder of approximately $4,836 that might be available for discretionary \nspending or savings. (AE AX; AE AY) The actual remainder should be increased because \nhe was still reporting anticipated payments that he had already made for accounts that \nhave already been paid off. In addition, Applicant has applied to the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs for disability compensation.

Included in that history are various incidents that \nresulted in various arrests for misdemeanors and felonies, the issuance of peace orders \n(similar to a protection order), violations of military standards and requirements, court \ndecisions, and military disciplinary actions. His actions while on active duty are not \nindividually alleged in the SOR. There are a number of post-discharge convictions, \nseveral charges were dismissed or otherwise not prosecuted, and the final disposition is \nnot known for some of the incidents. The incidents and their eventual results, are listed \nbelow: \nSOR \u00b6 3.b.: Applicant received a general discharge under honorable conditions \nfrom the U.S. Army in April 1987 for unsatisfactory performance, essentially for a variety \nof military violations during 1986-87. (AE J; GE 13 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nJune 1, 2016, at 6-7)) When questioned about his discharge by a Special Agent from the \nDefense Security Service in 2004, Applicant characterized his discharge basis as \u201cunable \nto perform\u201d because he was struck in the head with a baseball bat during a fight, fracturing \nhis skull, and he was thereafter unable to perform his military duties. (GE 13 (Statement, \ndated February 23, 2004, at 4)) He later explained that he was young and did not \nunderstand life. He conceded that he was disrespectful at times, and had numerous \nfights. (GE 13 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 3, 2017, at 9)) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b.: In April or May 1988, he was arrested for simple assault, a \nmisdemeanor, but the prosecutor declined to file a charge, and the matter was apparently \ndismissed when it was \u201cnon-papered.\u201d (GE 10; AE E; GE 13 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated June 1, 2016, at 16)) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c.: In February 1989, he was arrested and charged with battery, a \nmisdemeanor, when he was in a fist fight with his father. He explained that he had \npreviously been abused as a child, and he became very angry with him. His father \nreported the incident to authorities. Although he contended that he was not prosecuted, \nhe was, in fact, released on a bail bond, and placed on probation before judgment. (GE \n9, at 9; GE 8, at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d.: In October 1990, he was arrested and charged with battery and \nmalicious destruction of property (with a value less than $300), both misdemeanors, when \nhe grabbed a female friend\u2019s arm too hard. The \u201cvictim\u201d had broken the lock on Applicant\u2019s \nsister\u2019s automobile, so he grabbed her arm. Both charges were dismissed nolle prosequi. \n(Tr. at 65; GE 9, at 4, 9; GE 8, at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e.: In February 1992, he was arrested and charged with assault with a \ndeadly weapon \u2013 a shod foot. He had met a former girlfriend at a club, but he chose to \ngive her the cold shoulder and she became confrontational. She purportedly pushed him \nthrough a set of double doors, so he departed without further interaction. He went to a \nnearby fast-food restaurant, and she showed up there as well. Talking resulted in another \nargument, and then to another physical incident when she struck him, and he retaliated. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe kicked her with his shod foot.

(Tr. at 70-72; GE 8, at 3; AE 9, at 4; GE \n10, at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f.: In July 1993, he was arrested and charged with stalking, a \nmisdemeanor. The charge was dismissed nolle prosequi. No other information regarding \nthe incident was developed because the documentation did not contain any other facts \nand Applicant cannot recall the incident. (GE 8, at 3; GE 9, at 8) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g.: In January 1995, he was arrested and charged with simple assault, a \nmisdemeanor. He had dropped off his \u201cexpensive clothes\u201d at the cleaners, and when he \nwent to retrieve them, he discovered that they had destroyed them by using too much \nbleach. He was furious and decided to grab them and leave without paying for the \u201cpoor \nservice.\u201d The store manager followed him out and grabbed him. He turned around and \nsmacked her. He was convicted and sentenced to confinement (work release) for 180 \ndays (150 days suspended), and two years\u2019 supervised probation. (GE 8, at 3; GE 9, at \n4; GE 10, at 4-6) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h.: In May 1997, he was arrested for destruction of property over $200, a \nfelony. He had previously given his girlfriend a laptop computer, but after an argument, \nhe took it back and threw it into the trash, where the police found it. He was held for \nseveral hours, but the prosecutor declined to file a charge, and the matter was dismissed \nwhen it was \u201cnon-papered.\u201d (GE 8, at 3-4; GE 9, at 4; GE 10, at 7) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i.: In April 2003, a temporary peace order was issued against him, \ndirecting that he shall not commit an unspecified prohibited act; that he not contact the \nunidentified petitioner; that he shall not enter an unspecified location; and that he shall \nstay away from an unspecified someone or some thing or place. The peace order was \ndismissed one week later. (GE 11, at 1-2) The basis for the peace order was not reported. \nSOR \u00b6 2.j.: In October 2005, another temporary peace order was issued against \nhim, directing that he shall not commit an unspecified prohibited act; that he not contact \nthe unidentified petitioner; that he shall not enter an unspecified location; and that he shall \nstay away from the residence of the unspecified petitioner. The peace order was reissued \none week later, and finally dismissed three weeks later. (GE 11, at 3-5) The basis for the \npeace order was not reported. \nSOR \u00b6 2.k.: In January 2007, he was arrested and charged with simple assault \u2013 \ndomestic violence, after a physical altercation with his brother. Four months later, the \ncharge was dismissed for want of prosecution.

Upon his \nplea of guilty, he was sentenced to one year of supervised probation and 180 days \n(suspended). (GE 9, at 6; GE 10, at 17-20; AE E; Second Answer, at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.q.: In November 2011, a temporary peace order was issued against him, \nand one week later, a final peace order was issued. (GE 11, at 9-10) The basis for the \npeace order was not reported. \nSOR \u00b6 2.r.: In April 2012, depending on which GE is accurate, he was either \narrested and charged with obstructing police \u2013 disobeying a lawful order; traffic offense \u2013 \nspeeding 83/55 mph; and disorderly conduct, according to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) Identification Record (GE 9, at 6-7), or arrested and charged with \nspeeding; and interfering with agency functions \u2013 disobeying a lawful order, according to \nthe district court and the Violation Notice that was issued to him by the police. (GE 12) I \nfind the court documentation more persuasive as it is primary evidence, not secondary \nevidence. He was fined for the speeding charge, and the violation of the lawful order \ncharge was dismissed upon a plea agreement. (GE 12) \nSOR \u00b6 2.s.: In July 2012, a temporary peace order was issued against him, \ndirecting that he shall not abuse, shall not contact, shall not enter residence, and shall \nstay away from employment of the unspecified petitioner. The peace order was reissued \none week later, and finally dismissed three weeks later. (GE 11, at 11) The basis for the \npeace order was not reported. \nSOR \u00b6 2.t.: In June 2015, he was arrested and charged with simple assault \u2013 \ndomestic violence and attempted possession of a prohibited weapon (a stick), after his \nsoon-to-be ex-brother-in-law came to the family home and repeatedly created a \ndisturbance. Applicant simply attempted to protect his mother and sister. The following \nmonth, the charges were dismissed for want of prosecution. (GE 9, at 7; GE 10, at 21-23; \nSecond Answer, at 3) \nApplicant is remorseful about his violent past and he contends that he is no longer \nthe person he was when he was involved in the above conduct, and that his life now has \nmeaning and purpose. Although he screwed up in the past, he loved being in the military. \nNevertheless, he acknowledged that he was \u201ca screw up operating on auto pilot trying to \nfind myself.\u201d Now that he has found himself, he can admit that he is not perfect. He is a \nman who made mistakes, and he pays for them every day with the thought of knowing \nthat he did something wrong.

(Second \nAnswer, at 3-4) \nCharacter References \nApplicant\u2019s mother, older brother, and middle sister, are effusive in praise for him, \nrecognizing the difficulties he encountered when he was growing up. His brother recalled \nthe very traumatic childhood Applicant went through when he was physically, mentally, \nand sexually abused by their father and stepmother. On one Christmas occasion, he \nreceived no gifts, but was forced to sit and watch while the other members of the family \nopened their gifts. At one point, their father tried to turn him over to the state. Applicant is \ncharacterized as kind, caring, a man of character and integrity, considerate, \ncompassionate, very loving, engaging, and funny. He spreads his hugs and kisses to the \nentire family, especially the children, and he serves as a mentor to one of his nephews. \nApplicant\u2019s past actions were due to the only way he knew how to deal with his problems: \nhe fought as a child and young adult. Now, he has direction and a purpose, and he cries \nwhen he speaks about his past. For overcoming his troubled past, Applicant is considered \na success story. (AE AW; AE X; AE Z) \nCurrent and former work colleagues are also extremely supportive of Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified information. One individual, a lead network architect, considers him \nto be one of the most dedicated engineers that he has experienced in his career. He has \na strong work ethic, high quality work, adherence to protocol, knowledge and ability, and \na sincere ambition to serve others with the very best of his efforts. He is trustworthy and \nhonest. He is a fast-learner, and he is very careful and cautious about his work. In part, \nbecause he has gone out of his way to welcome newcomers and resolve any problems \nthey might have, pitches innovative ideas at company meetings, accepts constructive \ncriticism, and remained late to complete time-sensitive projects, he has often been given \nadditional responsibilities and assumed a leadership role. (AE Y) \nA former colleague worked with him for approximately six years, and aside from \nhis favorable comments regarding Applicant\u2019s work performance, he commented \nfavorably regarding his personal life, about which he is very familiar. He noted that \nApplicant will be the first to admit that at times he has been quick tempered, but he seems \nto be doing all in his power to be more self-aware and in control of his actions and \nreactions. (AE AV) \nOne individual, who has a nonprofit organization that operates transitional housing \nfor returning citizens, has known Applicant for over 50 years. He has watched him grow \nup into a respectable, dependable, and trustworthy man. He is honest, walks with \nintegrity, and has a strong work ethic and sense of responsibility. Applicant has \nvolunteered to prepare a transition house to receive new participants, but also served as \na mentor to teach the individual\u2019s son and his cousin about painting professionally, \ncleaning up responsibly, and the importance of working hard, studying for school, and \nbeing careful about the people with whom he hangs around. He has no reservations \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s character and fitness for a security clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had ten delinquent SOR-alleged accounts totaling approximately \n$25,165, as well as a number of delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. \nHe claimed that he did not have sufficient funds to maintain them in a current status. \nWhen the SOR was issued in November 2019, nearly all of his accounts were still \ndelinquent, and Applicant had only made a few voluntary payments to creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established, but there is insufficient evidence that \nApplicant had been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \n\u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) fully or partially apply, but none of the other \nconditions apply. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered \nrecent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant attributed some of his financial \nproblems to having to make $1,700 in monthly child-support payments, and although he \ndid not focus on other factors, he experienced a number of short-term periods of \nunemployment between positions, as well as some health issues. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously; nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. In this instance, Applicant has resolved, or is in \nthe process of resolving, both his SOR-related debts and those that were not alleged in \nthe SOR. \nApplicant managed to address and resolve only one of his SOR-related delinquent \naccounts before the SOR was issued. He started addressing the other delinquent \naccounts after the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins to resolve financial \nproblems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy \nmay be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over \ntime or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Sept. 18, 2018)). However, as to those remaining SOR-related accounts, most of \nthem have been resolved, with only four of them still in the process of being resolved. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s former financial difficulties, and \nhis general failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until the SOR was issued, \nis sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. However, his \nstrong showing that most of the accounts are now resolved, or about to be resolved, along \nwith his substantial increase in the amount of money that will be available for discretionary \nspending or savings each month, indicate that the financial problems are substantially in \nthe past. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nWhile there is no evidence of financial counseling, Applicant did seek assistance \nfrom an organization to clean up his financial situation. He subsequently cancelled the \nprofessional relationship and started addressing his delinquent accounts by himself. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile the timeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, the subsequent \nsubstantial positive and successful efforts is very good. He is in a much better position \nfinancially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances no \nlonger cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes three conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nDuring the 27-year period 1988-2015, Applicant was arrested and charged on 12 \noccasions for a variety of incidents, mostly involving his violent behavior with former \ngirlfriends or family members \u2013 assaults \u2013 and destruction of property. Of those 12 \nincidents, he was \u201cconvicted\u201d of only 4 criminal charges, and was sentenced to either \nprobation before judgment; probation and community service; 30 days\u2019 work-release \nconfinement; or supervised probation. He also had seven temporary peace orders issued, \nrestricting his ability to be near individuals \u2013 generally former girlfriends \u2013 or locations. \nAccordingly, based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been \nestablished. While Applicant was discharged from the military for poor performance with \na general discharge under honorable conditions, I do not believe that is the same as less \nthen honorable under the intention of that portion of the condition, and AG \u00b6 31(e) has \nnot been established \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. As noted above, on a number of occasions between \n1988 and 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with a variety of crimes, essentially \nassault and destruction of property, and issued temporary peace orders. Applicant seems \nto be the major source of the information regarding those incidents, for his explanations \nhave gone unrebutted. Examining the rather sketchy damaging documentary evidence \nsubmitted against him, and the substantial number of dismissals, leads to a conclusion \nthat Applicant\u2019s explanations are essentially true. It is significant that he does not deny \nhaving been angry and violent in his past. \nHowever, so much time has elapsed since that alleged criminal behavior happened \n\u2013 at least five and one-half years since the last alleged incident \u2013 and the most recent \nincident happened under such unusual circumstances involving a soon-to-be ex-brother-\nin-law creating a disturbance with Applicant\u2019s mother and sister, and there has been no \nmore recent similar behavior of conduct, that it appears that it is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant contends that he is no longer the person he was when he was involved in the \nalleged criminal conduct, and that his life now has meaning and purpose. He \nacknowledged that he was \u201ca screw up operating on auto pilot trying to find himself.\u201d But, \nhe has finally freed himself from the negativity of his troubled youth and early adulthood. \nSome of his character references substantiate the transition from an abused child, to a \nviolent adult, and the transformation to a loving, caring, peaceful adult. Other character \nreferences attest to his excellent work performance and caring nature. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, and \nin this instance the most recent alleged criminal conduct is over one-half decade ago. \nThere are no concerns about future criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s past history of criminal \nconduct, under the circumstances, no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. Moreover, \nas noted above, Applicant received a general discharge under honorable conditions from \nthe U.S. Army in April 1987 for unsatisfactory performance, essentially for a variety of \nmilitary violations during 1986-87. He explained that he was young and did not \nunderstand life. He conceded that he was disrespectful at times, and had numerous \nfights. As to the allegations regarding the alleged criminal conduct and his military \ndischarge, AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n16 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(e) apply. My comments associated with the criminal \nconduct section also apply in an assessment of personal conduct concerns. Applicant \nwas given a general discharge under honorable conditions from the U.S. Army in 1987 \u2013 \nnearly 24 years ago. His most recent alleged criminal conduct is over one-half decade \nago. He has repeatedly expressed remorse for his attitude and actions from his past. \nThose who know him attest to his trustworthiness, reliability, and outstanding \nperformance. It is highly unlikely that Applicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct, especially that \nwhich was associated with his criminal conduct, will recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the \nvarious aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not \nmerely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. \n1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nApplicant had ten delinquent SOR-alleged accounts totaling approximately \n$25,165, as well as a number of delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. \nWhen the SOR was issued in November 2019, nearly all of his accounts were still \ndelinquent, and Applicant had only made a few voluntary payments to creditors. When he \nwas discharged from the U.S. Army in 1987, he was issued a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions because of unsatisfactory performance, essentially related to \nrepeated violations of military standards and requirements, performance, and military \ndisciplinary actions. In addition, during a 27-year period, ending in 2015, he was arrested \n17 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand charged on 12 occasions for a variety of incidents, mostly involving his violent \nbehavior with former girlfriends or family members. He was also issued seven temporary \npeace orders restricting his ability to be near individuals or locations. \nThe mitigating evidence is simply more substantial and compelling. Applicant is a \n55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior network \nengineer since July 2019. He previously held a variety of positions (network engineer, \ndevelopment network engineer, deployment network engineer, information management \nsenior specialist, and senior network engineer) with different employers since early 2003. \nHe has received an offer from a new employer for a position of senior network engineer \nwith a starting annual salary of $160,000. He is a 1983 high school graduate. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Army in October 1984, and served on active duty until April 1987. He was \ngranted a secret clearance on an unspecified date. He has two children. Of his SOR-\nrelated debts, he has resolved most of them, and he is in the process of resolving the few \nremaining ones. He has also resolved debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He has not \nbeen involved in any criminal misconduct for over one-half decade, and he is remorseful \nabout his past conduct. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial track record is finally very good. Eventually, after some \nunexplained delays until the SOR was issued, he started focusing on his delinquent \naccounts and started to resolve them himself. Most of them have now been resolved, with \nthe few remaining debts actually in the process of being resolved. His military career \ncame to an end 33 years ago. His criminal conduct ceased over one-half decade ago. \nOverall, the evidence no longer leaves me with any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \n18 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations, \ncriminal conduct, and personal conduct.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments as well as documentary attachments, all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.t.). As a result of a review of the evidence submitted, as discussed below, it appears that some of his admissions were ill-advised and erroneous. Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a security officer since January 2018. Because of his employment schedule, he has also been working concurrently with at least one, and sometimes two, other employers in an identical capacity. He received his General Education Diploma (GED) in 1994 or 1995, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a master\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in December 1996, and served on active duty until May 2006, when he was placed on the temporary disability retired list and honorably discharged as a petty officer second class (pay grade E-5).

On February 24, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a notarized statement, dated March 16, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR, \nand he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on October 29, 2020. The case was \nassigned to me on November 5, 2020. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 23, \n2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 14, 2020. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through AE H (all originally attached to his Answer to the SOR), and Administrative \nExhibit I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on December 3, 2020. I kept the record open until January 13, 2021, \nto enable him to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted numerous documents, some of which were duplicates of documents already in \nevidence. The new documents were marked and admitted as AE I through AE R without \nobjection. The record closed on January 13, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments as well \nas documentary attachments, all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial \nconsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.t.). As a result of a review of the evidence \nsubmitted, as discussed below, it appears that some of his admissions were ill-advised \nand erroneous. Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After \na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a security officer since January 2018. Because of his employment schedule, he has \nalso been working concurrently with at least one, and sometimes two, other employers in \nan identical capacity. He received his General Education Diploma (GED) in 1994 or 1995, \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a master\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy \nin December 1996, and served on active duty until May 2006, when he was placed on the \ntemporary disability retired list and honorably discharged as a petty officer second class \n(pay grade E-5). He was granted a secret clearance in 1996. He was married in 1997, \nand divorced in 2003. He remarried in 2006, and was divorced in 2016. He was remarried \nin 2020. He has two children, born in 1995 and 2016. His youngest child resides with him. \n(Tr. at 41) \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his period of active duty, Applicant received the Good Conduct Medal (3 \nawards), the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (2 awards), the Navy Expert \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPistol Medal, the Navy Expert Rifle Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal (AE I) \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 2 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 3, \n2019); GE 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated April 29, 2019, and Subject Contact, \ndated May 16, 2019); Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated March 16, 2020; and AE L \n(Statement, undated). \nWhen he was interviewed by an investigator from the US. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in April 2019, Applicant acknowledged that he had several \ndelinquent accounts. His significant financial difficulties commenced in April 2014 when \nhe was injured in the line of duty while in an altercation trying to subdue a suspect found \nin an unauthorized location. He sustained a shoulder injury that had previously been \ninjured. His shoulder was surgically repaired in August 2014, and he was required to use \na sling fulltime for six weeks, with no shoulder motion. He was out of work for \napproximately one year. (Tr. at 49-50; AE D; AE E; Answer to the SOR) Another similar-\ntype incident occurred in 2015, and he again underwent surgical repairs to the same \nshoulder in July 2015. He was out of work for approximately another year. (Tr. at 58; AE \nC; AE F) He was initially denied full workers\u2019 compensation because his injuries had not \nreached the designated level required. As a result of the combined injuries, Applicant\u2019s \nincome plummeted until he could regain full use of his shoulder and arm and go back to \nwork full time. (AE C; Answer to the SOR) He engaged the services of an attorney to fight \nthe workers\u2019 compensation decision, and although he settled for $50,000, his lawyer took \nroughly $15,000 of that amount. (Tr. at 57-58; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant attributed another factor to his financial difficulties. Between surgeries, \nhis wife \u201ctricked\u201d or \u201clured\u201d him to go out of town for their anniversary, and when they \nreturned home, he discovered her family had emptied their residence. His wife then left \nhim with nothing but the house. (Tr. at 50) As a result of his injuries and his wife\u2019s refusal \nto assist him with the mortgage, bills accumulated. He used credit cards to pay bills, and \ntook out loans to pay earlier loans, until he realized he wasn\u2019t improving his financial \nstatus. (Tr. at 52; AE 3, at 12) \nIn October 2016 \u2013 approximately three and one-quarter years before the SOR was \nissued \u2013 Applicant engaged the professional services of a law firm to assist him in \nresolving his debts. They advised him to stop making any payments to facilitate \nsettlements. (AE 3, at 12) He entered their debt-resolution program and, starting on \nNovember 1, 2016, he agreed to pay them an $800 retainer fee; make monthly $847.88 \npayments, including monthly legal administration fees of $89, monthly banking fees of \n$10.95, and monthly service costs of $454.46, continuing through February 1, 2021. \nAdditionally, if the law firm was unsuccessful in settling accounts, Applicant agreed to pay \nthe law firm for litigation services and trial preparation costs. The program listed 17 \ndifferent accounts that were to be handled. (AE A; AE B) Unfortunately, because of his \nfinancial naivety, he has relied completely on the guidance furnished him by the law firm, \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand the law firm, in turn, has charged him for its services, but has failed to either keep \nhim timely or adequately informed about the specific status of the enrolled accounts, or \ntimely respond to specific inquiries sent to it by him. Applicant\u2019s superficial knowledge \nabout his own accounts has caused him to make inaccurate statements regarding some \naccounts, when those statements should have been accurately said about completely \ndifferent accounts. \nIn July 2020, Applicant also engaged the services of a credit-repair organization to \n\u201cclean\u201d up his credit report and remove all inconsistencies by disputing the entries. (Tr. at \n106-107) Although he said he would submit a report of their activities, he failed to do so. \n(Tr. at 37-38) \nThe SOR alleged 20 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $84,055. Because \nof the way the listed accounts appear in Applicant\u2019s debt-resolution program (partial \ncreditor names; some partial account numbers; some full account numbers; and some \nmissing account numbers), it is difficult to align the SOR-alleged accounts with those in \nthe debt-resolution program, especially since the credit report on which the SOR-listed \nallegations are based, also does not fully identify essential account information. The SOR-\nalleged accounts are set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a home mortgage with an original loan of $347,000 that fell \ninto arrears, and when Applicant was ordered by the court to vacate the residence during \npre-foreclosure proceedings in October 2018, he stopped making payments. The \ndeficiency increased to $31,402. (Item 2, at 1) There was no foreclosure because the \ndivorce court trustee stepped in, and the residence was sold to Applicant. (Tr. at 65) The \naccount was settled in October 2018, when the law firm paid the creditor $321.34 on his \nbehalf. The creditor considered the account to be paid in full with a zero balance \u2013 a year \nand a quarter before the SOR was issued. (AE J; AE B \u2013 Letter from Creditor, dated, \nOctober 22, 2018; Tr. at 65-66) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $17,189 that \nwas charged off. (GE 2, at 2) While the law firm contends that the account was \nsuccessfully settled, Applicant\u2019s request of them for documents to support their claim and \nthe specifics of the settlement has gone unheeded or ignored. ((AE B, at 2; AE S, at 3; \nAE L, at 1) Other than the law firm\u2019s representation, the documentary support regarding \nthe settlement is missing. Nevertheless, it appears that the account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $10,102 that \nwas charged off. (GE 2, at 2) The law firm previously stated that the account was new \n(AE B, at 1; AE S, at 3), but earlier documentation issued by the law firm shows it as one \nof those listed in the debt-resolution program. (AE A, at 22) Applicant contends that the \nlaw firm is negotiating a settlement with the creditor, with payments to come out of his \nescrow account with them. (AE L, at 2) While the specific status of the account is not yet \nknown, it appears that it is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to a bank-issued superstore charge account with an unpaid \nbalance of $3,846 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \npurchaser. (GE 2, at 2)  The account is one of the 17 accounts enrolled in the law firm\u2019s \ninitial agreement, but the status is still listed as \u201cnew.\u201d  (AE A, at 22; AE B, at 1; AE S, at \n3) Applicant contends that the creditor will not speak to him about the account because \nhe is represented by the law firm. (AE L, at 2) Despite Applicant\u2019s efforts, the account has \nnot been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to an unspecified type of account with an unidentified creditor, \nalthough the identity of a debt purchaser is known, that resulted in a judgment for $3,442. \n(GE 2, at 2) Although Applicant contends that the account was enrolled in the debt-\nresolution program, it is difficult to align it with any of the accounts in the program. (AE L, \nat 2) Since the status of the account has not been clearly furnished, I conclude that the \naccount has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to a digital-payment-platform account with an unpaid balance of \n$3,377 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (GE 2, \nat 2) The account was enrolled in the debt-resolution program. Although the law firm \nreported the account was new, in May 2017 \u2013 two and three-quarters years before the \nSOR was issued \u2013 the account was settled for $1,511, with payments to be made between \nMay 31, 2017 and April 30, 2018. (AE B \u2013 Collection Agent Letter\u2019s dated May 31, 2017, \nand June 1, 2017; AE S) As recently as shortly after the hearing, Applicant erroneously \nasserted that that the collection agent for the creditor, that he erroneously thought was a \nmultinational technology company, will not speak to him about the account because he is \nrepresented by the law firm. (AE L, at 2) Despite Applicant\u2019s confusion regarding the \naccount, considering the absence of documentary proof of the payments having been \nmade, it appears that the account has not yet been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to a bank issued credit-card account with an unpaid balance of \n$2,569 that was placed for collection and charged off. (GE 2, at 2) The account was \nenrolled in the debt-resolution program, and as recently as January 2021, it was still \nreported as new. (AE S) Applicant contends that the account is in negotiation pending a \npayment plan agreement. (AE L, at 2) The account is in the very early process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $926 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off. (GE 2, at 2) It is unclear if the account was enrolled \nin the debt-resolution program, for there is an account with the same creditor, but a \ndifferent account number reflected (none of the four digits listed for the account in the \nprogram appear as part of two other accounts with the same creditor that are alleged in \nthe SOR), and as recently as January 2021, it was still reported as new. (AE S) Applicant \ncontends that the account is in negotiation pending a payment plan agreement. (AE L, at \n2) The account is in the very early process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,324 that \nwas placed for collection and charged off. (GE 2, at 2) The account was enrolled in the \ndebt-resolution program, and as recently as January 2021, it was still reported as new. \n(AE S) Applicant contends that the account is in negotiation pending a payment plan \nagreement.

Furthermore, it appears that the law firm\u2019s emphasis was on costs \nrather than adequately listing the accounts enrolled in the debt resolution program; \nfurnishing detailed documentation of payments made; or timely responding to Applicant\u2019s \ninquiries. Applicant\u2019s financial bewilderment, when combined with these two problems \nhas resulted in significant confusion. \nApplicant submitted documentation regarding several accounts which could not be \naligned with those alleged in the SOR or in the debt resolution program, and it is highly \npossible, if not probable, that these other accounts are referred to in the SOR with a \ndifferent identity.

(Tr. at 105-106) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant had 20 delinquent SOR-alleged accounts totaling approximately \n$84,055, as well as a number of delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. \nHe claimed that he did not have sufficient funds to maintain them in a current status. He \nused credit cards to pay bills, and took out loans to pay earlier loans. Although he admitted \nthat all of the accounts alleged in the SOR were still delinquent as of the date the SOR \nwas issued, his admissions with regard to some of the accounts were erroneous. \nNevertheless, at some point, all of the accounts were delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nhave been established, but there is insufficient evidence that Applicant had been unwilling \nto satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply, and AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies.

A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant attributed his financial problems \nto having been injured on several occasions while serving as a security officer, with his \ninjuries resulting in disability-based unemployment for lengthy periods; his decreased \nincome while he was unable to return to work; and his wife\u2019s actions in removing all the \ncontents of their residence, refusing to assist him with their residence mortgage, along \nwith their eventual divorce. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously; nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn this instance, Applicant had such a plan, well before the SOR was issued. \nAlthough he is financially na\u00efve, he engaged the professional services of a law firm to \nassist him in resolving his delinquent debts, and he enrolled in their debt resolution \nprogram, starting in October 2016 \u2013 approximately three and one-quarter years before \nthe SOR was issued. In addition to a retainer and other costs, he pays that law firm \n$847.88 per month to handle his accounts. In reviewing the law firm\u2019s reports to him, \nseveral accounts, both SOR-related and unrelated, have been paid off, several accounts \nhave been settled, and others are in the queue. \nWith respect to one of the main evidentiary documents in the record \u2013 the credit \nreport \u2013 the Appeal Board has explained that it is \u201cwell-settled that adverse information \nfrom a credit report can normally meet the substantial evidence standard and the \ngovernment\u2019s obligations under [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).\u201d It noted that the burden then \nshifts to the applicant to establish either that he is not responsible for the debt or that \nmatters in mitigation apply. (ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010)) \nHowever, there is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of credit \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreports without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit bureaus \ncollect information from a variety of sources, including public records and \u201cother sources,\u201d \nand it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for concern. Likewise, when \naccounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, an individual\u2019s credit \nhistory can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, the credit report referred \nto numerous creditors for several delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names \nand acronyms, multiple and partial account numbers for the same account listed several \ntimes under different creditors, debt purchasers, or collection agents, many of those \nentries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated the financial concerns. One can \nconclude that the information in the credit report \u2013 actually a summary or secondary \nevidence pertaining to an account \u2013 is less accurate, trustworthy, or reliable than the other \nevidence of record. This difficulty has arisen and created unnecessary confusion for \nApplicant, Department Counsel, and this Administrative Judge in aligning alleged \naccounts with documents submitted in mitigation by Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly payments to the law firm, as well as his strong showing that \nhis delinquent accounts are either resolved, in the process of being resolved, or about to \nbe resolved, along with the amount of money that is available for discretionary spending \nor savings each month, indicate that his financial problems are substantially in the past. \nWhile he might have a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of some debts, he failed \nto provide any documented proof to substantiate the basis of his disputes. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nWhile there is no evidence of formal financial counseling, Applicant did seek \nguidance and assistance from the law firm and the credit-repair organization to resolve \nhis debts and clean up his financial situation. Now that he has returned to work, he is in \na much better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the \nvarious aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not \nmerely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. \n1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen the SOR was issued, it was alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent \naccounts totaling approximately $84,055. It appears that he also had a number of \ndelinquent accounts that were not thoroughly or accurately in his credit report. \nThe mitigating evidence is simply more substantial and compelling. Applicant is a \n46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a security officer \nsince January 2018. Because of his employment schedule, he has also been working \nconcurrently with at least one, and sometimes two other employers in an identical \ncapacity. He received his GED in 1994 or 1995, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in December 1996, and served on \nactive duty until May 2006, when he was placed on the temporary disability retired list \nand honorably discharged as a petty officer second class (pay grade E-5). He was granted \na secret clearance in 1996. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose in 2014 because of two incidents of work-\nrelated injuries, about one year apart, and he was unable to work. His workers\u2019 \ncompensation was reduced or delayed until he obtained a settlement. Adding to his \nfinancial problems were his wife\u2019s actions and her refusal to contribute to mortgage \npayments while he was unable to work. In October 2016 \u2013 approximately three and one-\nquarter years before the SOR was issued, he enrolled in a debt-resolution program. In \naddition to a retainer, he makes monthly payments of $847.88 to enable the law firm \nprogram to resolve his debts. They have been successful in resolving some accounts, \nsettling some accounts, and are in the process of resolving other accounts. The law firm \nhas also resolved debts that were not alleged in the SOR. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial track record is outstanding. He started focusing on his \ndelinquent accounts years before the SOR was issued. Overall, the evidence no longer \nleaves me with any questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t.: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on October 29, 2020. The case was \nassigned to me on November 5, 2020. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 23, \n2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 14, 2020. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through AE H (all originally attached to his Answer to the SOR), and Administrative \nExhibit I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on December 3, 2020. I kept the record open until January 13, 2021, \nto enable him to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted numerous documents, some of which were duplicates of documents already in \nevidence. The new documents were marked and admitted as AE I through AE R (actually \nAE S, part of which was identical to AE B) without objection. Because of questions raised \nregarding a credit report that apparently had been used by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) during his April 2019 interview of Applicant, \nDepartment Counsel was requested to furnish Applicant and me a copy of that credit \nreport. Slightly more than one hour after the hearing closed, Department Counsel \nsubmitted two additional credit reports, tentatively marked as GE 4 and GE 5, for my \nconsideration. Unfortunately, those two documents were mislaid and overlooked during \nmy analysis of the case. The record closed on January 13, 2021. \nOn February 3, 2021, after having considered all of the evidence, with the \nexception of GE 4 and GE 5, I issued a decision in the case. The decision was that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Accordingly, his eligibility for access to classified information was granted. \nDepartment Counsel subsequently appealed that decision. \nOn April 28, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Appeal \nBoard issued a decision, remanding the case for the following reasons: \nAs a threshold matter, a question exists about whether the record of this \nproceeding is complete.

(Tr. at 54-55) Another similar-type incident \noccurred in 2015, and he again underwent surgical repairs to the same shoulder in July \n2015. He was out of work for approximately another year. (Tr. at 58; AE C; AE F) During \nthat post-surgery recovery period, he took a brief holiday in Jamaica, costing somewhere \nbetween $500 and $1,000. (Tr. at 62-63) He was initially denied full workers\u2019 \ncompensation because his injuries had not reached the designated level required. As a \nresult of the combined injuries, Applicant\u2019s income plummeted until he could regain full \nuse of his shoulder and arm and go back to work full time. (AE C; Answer to the SOR) He \nengaged the services of an attorney to fight the workers\u2019 compensation decision, and \nalthough he settled for $50,000, his lawyer was paid roughly $15,000 of that amount. (Tr. \nat 57-58; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant attributed another factor to his financial difficulties. Between surgeries, \nhis wife \u201ctricked\u201d or \u201clured\u201d him to go out of town for their anniversary, and when they \nreturned home, he discovered her family had emptied their residence. His wife then left \nhim with nothing but the house. (Tr. at 50) As a result of his injuries and his wife\u2019s refusal \nto assist him with the mortgage, bills accumulated. He used credit cards to pay bills, and \ntook out loans to pay earlier loans - until he realized he wasn\u2019t improving his financial \nstatus. (Tr. at 52; AE 3, at 12) \nIn October 2016 \u2013 approximately three and one-quarter years before the SOR was \nissued \u2013 Applicant engaged the professional services of a law firm to assist him in \nresolving his debts. They advised him to stop making any payments to facilitate \nsettlements. (AE 3, at 12) He entered their debt-resolution program and, starting on \nNovember 1, 2016, he agreed to pay them an $800 retainer fee; make monthly $847.88 \npayments, including monthly legal administration fees of $89, monthly banking fees of \n$10.95, and monthly service costs of $454.46, continuing through February 1, 2021. \nAdditionally, if the law firm was unsuccessful in settling accounts, Applicant agreed to pay \nthe law firm for litigation services and trial preparation costs. The program listed 17 \ndifferent accounts that were to be handled. (AE A; AE B) Unfortunately, because of his \nfinancial naivety, he relied completely on the guidance furnished him by the law firm, and \nthe law firm, in turn, charged him for its services, but has failed to either keep him timely \nor adequately informed about the specific status of the enrolled accounts, or timely \nrespond to specific inquiries sent to it by him. Applicant\u2019s superficial knowledge about his \nown accounts, and the frequently misleading statements by the law firm, have caused \nhim to make inaccurate statements regarding some accounts, when those statements \nshould have accurately referred to completely different accounts. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2020, Applicant also engaged the services of a credit-repair organization to \n\u201cclean up\u201d his credit report and remove all inconsistencies by disputing the entries. (Tr. at \n106-107) Although he said he would submit a report of their activities, he failed to do so. \n(Tr. at 37-38) \nThe SOR alleged 20 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $84,055. Because \nof the way the listed accounts appear in Applicant\u2019s debt-resolution program (partial \ncreditor names; some partial account numbers; some full account numbers; and some \nmissing account numbers), it is difficult to align the SOR-alleged accounts with those in \nthe debt-resolution program, especially since the credit report on which the SOR-listed \nallegations are based, also does not fully identify essential account information. The SOR-\nalleged accounts are set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a home mortgage with an original loan of $347,000 that fell \ninto arrears. When Applicant was ordered by the court to vacate the residence during pre-\nforeclosure proceedings in October 2018, he stopped making payments. The deficiency \nincreased to $31,402. (GE 2, at 1; GE 5, at 6) By March 2020, the deficiency had been \nreduced to $19,782. (GE 5, at 6) There was no foreclosure because the divorce court \ntrustee stepped in, and the residence was sold to Applicant. (Tr. at 65) The account was \nsettled in October 2018, when the law firm paid the creditor $321.34 on his behalf. The \ncreditor considered the account to be paid in full with a zero balance \u2013 a year and a \nquarter before the SOR was issued. (AE J; AE B \u2013 Letter from Creditor, dated, October \n22, 2018; Tr. at 65-66) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $17,189 that \nwas charged off. (GE 2, at 2; GE 5, at 6) While the law firm contends that the account \nwas successfully settled, Applicant\u2019s request of them for documents to support their claim \nand the specifics of the settlement has gone unheeded or ignored. (AE B, at 2; AE S, at \n3; AE L, at 1) Other than the law firm\u2019s representation, the documentary support regarding \nthe settlement is missing. Nevertheless, it appears that the account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $10,102 that \nwas charged off. (GE 2, at 2; GE 5, at 7; GE 4, at 3) The law firm previously stated that \nthe account was new (AE B, at 1; AE S, at 3), but earlier documentation issued by the \nlaw firm shows it as one of those listed in the debt-resolution program. (AE A, at 22) \nApplicant contends that the law firm is negotiating a settlement with the creditor, with \npayments to come out of his escrow account with them. (AE L, at 2) While the specific \nstatus of the account is not yet known, it appears that it is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to a bank-issued charge account with an unpaid balance of \n$3,846 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (GE 2, \nat 2; GE 5, at 10, 22)  The account is one of the 17 accounts enrolled in the law firm\u2019s \ninitial agreement, but the status is still listed as \u201cnew.\u201d  (AE A, at 22; AE B, at 1; AE S, at \n3) Applicant contends that the creditor will not speak to him about the account because \nhe is represented by the law firm.

(GE 2, \nat 2; GE 5, at 22; GE 4, at 2) There was purportedly a judgment obtained for $3,442, but \nthere is no evidence of such judgment. Although Applicant contends that the account was \nenrolled in the debt-resolution program, without additional specific information from him, \nit is difficult to align it with any of the several accounts with the same creditor, collection \nagent, or debt purchaser, in the program. (AE B; L, at 2) Since the status of the account \nhas not been clearly furnished, I conclude that the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to a digital-payment-platform account with an unpaid balance of \n$3,377 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (GE 2, \nat 2) The account was enrolled in the debt-resolution program. Although the law firm \nreported the account was new, in May 2017 \u2013 two and three-quarters years before the \nSOR was issued \u2013 the account was settled for $1,511, with payments to be made between \nMay 31, 2017 and April 30, 2018. (AE B \u2013 Collection Agent Letter\u2019s dated May 31, 2017, \nand June 1, 2017; AE S) As recently as shortly after the hearing, Applicant asserted that \nthe collection agent for the creditor, that he erroneously thought was a multinational \ntechnology company, will not speak to him about the account because he is represented \nby the law firm. (AE L, at 2) Despite Applicant\u2019s confusion regarding the account, \nconsidering the absence of documentary proof of the payments having actually been \nmade, the specific status of the account is not yet known, but it appears that it was in the \nprocess of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to a bank issued credit-card account with an unpaid balance of \n$2,569 that was placed for collection and charged off. (GE 2, at 2; GE 5, at 7) The account \nwas enrolled in the debt-resolution program, and as recently as January 2021, it was still \nreported as new.

(AE L, at 2) While the specific status of the account is not yet \nknown, it appears that it is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $926 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off. As of December 2020, the past-due balance had \nincreased to $1,911. (GE 2, at 2; GE 5, at 12; GE 4, at 5) It is unclear if the account was \nenrolled in the debt-resolution program, for there is an account with the same creditor, \nbut a different account number reflected (none of the four digits listed for the account in \nthe program appear as part of two other accounts with the same creditor that are alleged \nin the SOR), and as recently as January 2021, it was still reported as new.

Furthermore, it appears that the law \nfirm\u2019s emphasis was on costs rather than adequately listing the accounts enrolled in the \ndebt resolution program; furnishing detailed documentation of payments made; or timely \nresponding to Applicant\u2019s inquiries. Applicant\u2019s financial bewilderment, when combined \nwith these two problems, has resulted in significant confusion. \nApplicant submitted documentation regarding several accounts which could not be \naligned with those alleged in the SOR or in the debt resolution program, and it is highly \npossible, if not probable, that these other accounts are referred to in the SOR with a \ndifferent identity. For example, while SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.k. refer to two accounts with the \nsame creditor, each with relatively modest balances, Applicant submitted documentation \nindicating that substantial payments had been made to the same creditor with a different \naccount number. (AE O) In addition, while SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.f., and 1.p. refer to three \naccounts with the same debt purchaser, Applicant submitted documentation indicating \nthat payments had been made, either through voluntary payment or by garnishment, well \nbefore the SOR was issued, to the same debt purchasers for bank-issued charge \naccounts that appear to be different from the one associated with SOR \u00b6 1.d., and both \naccounts have been resolved. (AE P; AE R; AE Q) \nApplicant reported approximately $9,160 in net monthly income; $4,809 in routine \nmonthly expenses; and $3,225 in debt payments, including his monthly payment to the \nlaw firm; leaving an anticipated monthly remainder of approximately $1,126 that might be \navailable for discretionary spending or savings. (AE M) While he never underwent formal \nfinancial counseling, Applicant considers the guidance and direction he receives from the \nlaw firm and the credit-repair organization to be such counseling. (Tr. at 105-106) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had 20 delinquent SOR-alleged accounts totaling approximately \n$84,055, as well as a number of delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. \nHe claimed that he did not have sufficient funds to maintain them in a current status. He \nused credit cards to pay bills, and took out loans to pay earlier loans. Although he admitted \nthat all of the accounts alleged in the SOR were still delinquent as of the date the SOR \nwas issued, his admissions with regard to some of the accounts were erroneous. \nNevertheless, at some point, all of the accounts were delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nhave been established, but there is insufficient evidence that Applicant had been unwilling \nto satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply, and AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant attributed his financial problems \nto having been injured on several occasions while serving as a security officer, with his \ninjuries resulting in disability-based unemployment for lengthy periods; his decreased \nincome while he was unable to return to work; and his wife\u2019s actions in removing all the \ncontents of their residence, refusing to assist him with their residence mortgage, along \nwith their eventual divorce.  \nAs noted in the Appeal Board Decision and Remand Order, Chief Department \nCounsel and Department Counsel argued: \nThe Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis runs counter to the record evidence and \nfails to consider important aspects of the case. They contend the 17 debts \nlisted in Applicant\u2019s debt resolution program, including two that have been \nresolved, are not debts listed in the SOR. More specifically, they challenge \nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.q have been \nresolved. They note that Applicant has multiple accounts with some \ncreditors and contend that, because the debt resolution program \ndocumentation does not list account numbers, it is impossible to determine \nwhich accounts are in that program.

They further argue the Judge failed in \nhis \nmitigation \nanalysis \nto \nconsider \nApplicant\u2019s \ncurrent \nfinancial \ncircumstances, his taking of international vacations while unemployed, his \npurchase of an expensive vehicle that he cannot afford to operate, and his \nacquisition of additional debts. \nISCR Case No. 19-02993 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2021) \nIt is a well-accepted precept that clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection \nprocedure. The guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt \nor issue alleged in the SOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve \nfinancial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no \nrequirement that an applicant immediately resolve issues or make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously; nor is there a requirement that the debts or issues \nalleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct \nmay provide for the payment of such debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn this instance, Applicant had such a plan well before the SOR was issued. \nAlthough he is financially na\u00efve, he engaged the professional services of a law firm to \nassist him in resolving his delinquent debts, and he enrolled in their debt resolution \nprogram, starting in October 2016 \u2013 approximately three and one-quarter years before \nthe SOR was issued. In addition to a retainer and other costs, he pays that law firm \n$847.88 per month to handle his accounts. In reviewing the law firm\u2019s reports to him, \nseveral accounts, both SOR-related and unrelated, have been paid off, several accounts \nhave been settled, and others are in the queue. In my analysis of the evidence, I have \ngiven substantial weight to the statements and reports from the representatives of the law \nfirm regarding the status of various accounts. If the attorney reported that an account is \nin the debt resolution program, is in an active repayment plan, or has been settled, in the \nabsence of contradictory evidence, I have accepted the reported status. This process \nchosen by Applicant is not too dissimilar from seeking bankruptcy protection under \nChapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code where accounts may be included in the Trustee\u2019s \nreport with a queue awaiting more active participation, i.e., scheduled payments. \nWith respect to one of the main evidentiary documents in the record \u2013 the \nSeptember 2019 credit report (GE 2) \u2013 the Appeal Board has explained that it is \u201cwell-\nsettled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the substantial \nevidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for \npertinent allegations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).\u201d \n(Emphasis added) It noted that the burden then shifts to the applicant to establish either \nthat he is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. (ISCR Case No. \n08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010)) However, there is a substantial risk when one \naccepts, at face value, the contents of some credit reports without obtaining original \nsource documentation to verify entries. Credit bureaus collect information from a variety \nof sources, including public records and \u201cother sources,\u201d and it is these other unidentified \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsources that are the cause for concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, \nreassigned, sold, or merely churned, an individual\u2019s credit history can look worse than it \nreally is.  \nIn this particular instance, the September 2019 credit report referred to numerous \ncreditors for several delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names and acronyms, \nmultiple and partial account numbers for the same account listed several times under \ndifferent creditors, debt purchasers, or collection agents, many of those entries are \ngarbled and redundant, and have inflated the financial concerns. One can conclude that \nthe information in that particular credit report \u2013 actually a summary or secondary evidence \npertaining to an account \u2013 might be less accurate, trustworthy, or reliable than the other \nevidence of record. It certainly does not furnish the information, much less evidence, \nnecessary to make an informed decision. This difficulty has arisen and created \nunnecessary confusion for Applicant, Department Counsel, and this Administrative Judge \nin aligning alleged accounts with documents submitted in mitigation by Applicant. \nInterestingly, Chief Department Counsel and Department Counsel argue that \u201cbecause \nthe debt resolution program documentation does not list account numbers, it is impossible \nto determine which accounts are in that program\u201d \u2013 an argument that could also apply to \nthe fact-deficient GE 2. \nThe issue with the September 2019 credit report was minimized somewhat by the \nsubmission of the other two credit reports (GE 4 and GE 5). Not only did GE 5 furnish \nmore detailed and thorough information regarding initial creditor names, it supplied more \ncomplete account numbers to enable a better alignment of the alleged accounts with \nthose reported in the credit reports. In addition, GE 4, the initially withheld December 2020 \ncredit report, supplied much-needed exculpatory-mitigating evidence regarding some of \nthe accounts that was not included in GE 2. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly payments to the law firm, as well as his strong showing that \nhis delinquent accounts are either resolved, in the process of being resolved, or about to \nbe resolved, along with the amount of money that is available for discretionary spending \nor savings each month, indicate that his financial problems are substantially in the past. \nWhile he might have a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of some debts, he failed \nto provide any documented proof to substantiate the basis of his disputes. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the \nvarious aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not \nmerely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. \n1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. He \ninitially used credit cards to pay bills, and took out loans to pay earlier loans. When the \nSOR was issued, it was alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $84,055. It appears that he also had a number of delinquent accounts that \nwere not thoroughly or accurately in his credit report. \nThe mitigating evidence is simply more substantial and compelling. Applicant is a \n46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a security officer \nsince January 2018. Because of his employment schedule, he has also been working \nconcurrently with at least one, and sometimes two other employers in an identical \ncapacity. He received his GED in 1994 or 1995, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in December 1996, and served on \nactive duty until May 2006, when he was placed on the temporary disability retired list\nand honorably discharged as a petty officer second class (pay grade E-5). He was granted\na secret clearance in 1996.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose in 2014 because of two incidents of work-\nrelated injuries, about one year apart, and he was unable to work. His workers\u2019 \ncompensation was reduced or delayed until he obtained a settlement. Adding to his \nfinancial problems were his wife\u2019s actions and her refusal to contribute to mortgage \npayments while he was unable to work. In October 2016 \u2013 approximately three and one-\nquarter years before the SOR was issued, he enrolled in a debt-resolution program. In \naddition to a retainer, he makes monthly payments of $847.88 to enable the law firm \nprogram to resolve his debts. They have been successful in resolving some accounts, \nsettling some accounts, and are in the process of resolving other accounts. The law firm \nhas also resolved debts that were not alleged in the SOR. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial track record is good. He started focusing on his \ndelinquent accounts years before the SOR was issued. Overall, the evidence no longer \nleaves me with any questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n16 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n17 \n",

This \ngenerated a security concern that he failed to mitigate. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines K and M, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. On January 27, 2020, \nApplicant admitted the allegation and requested a hearing. On June 2, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me, and on July 23, 2021, a notice of video teleconference hearing was \nissued, scheduling the case for August 10, 2021. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I received six government exhibits, marked and \nincorporated into the record as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 to 6, and I received Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. At the end of the hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request to allow him \nthe opportunity to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted eight \nexhibits that I incorporated into the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A to AE H. The transcript \n(Tr.)  was received on August 19, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 60-year-old married man with two adult children. He has a college \ndegree in the field of computer science, a master\u2019s degree in management, and a master\u2019s \ndegree of business administration. (Tr. 20) Applicant has been working in the defense \ncontracting industry for nearly 40 years. For much of that time, he has worked in advanced \nlogistics and hardware engineering. (Tr. 25) Applicant joined his current company in 2017, \nafter having worked for his previous employer since 1984. (Tr. 20) He has held a security \nclearance for his entire career. (Tr. 14, 31) \nIn April 2017, approximately four months before Applicant began his current job, he \ndownloaded 9,000 files from the company drive of his then-employer to a personal hard drive \nand a personal removable media drive. (Answer at 1; 43) Some of the downloaded files \ncontained \nsensitive \nand \nproprietary \ninformation, \nincluding \ntemplates, \nproprietary \ncoursework, and competition-sensitive operational data and cost volume information about a \nproposal that his company was working on. (Tr. 26, 49; 2 at 6; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 10, 17) \nCompany policy prohibited downloading of proprietary information onto personally owned \ndevices. (GE 4 at 3)  \nApplicant contends that he had no intention to steal any proprietary information, and \nthat he was unaware that any of the information that he transferred to his personal media \ndevices was proprietary. (Tr. 11, 37) Rather, his intent was to back up his \u201csamples\u201d folder of \nall of the different methods that he used over the years to perform his job. Applicant\u2019s \n\u201csamples\u201d folder contained a collection of all of the lessons that he learned during his \ncareer, in addition to various code that he had written over the years. (Tr. 12, 21-22) \nApplicant considered it his personal intellectual property. (Tr. 66) Moreover, he contends that \nit was common practice to store company information on personal thumb drives before the \npolicy was changed in 2014. (Tr. 34) When Applicant first began backing up what he thought \nto be non-proprietary information, a pop-up information technology warning banner appeared \non his computer screen, informing him that he should not connect a personal device to a \ncompany asset. (Tr. 43; Answer at 3; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 35) Nevertheless, he proceeded with \nthe information transfer. (Answer at 3) \nThe most files that Applicant ever downloaded in his career with his employer before \nthe download in April 2017, was five. (GE 4 at 2) The size of Applicant\u2019s download and the \namount of time that it engaged his work computer to complete it prompted a company \ninvestigation in May 2017. (GE 6 at 1) The investigation was spearheaded by the director of \ncapture management and the lead investigator of the division where Applicant worked. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s company issues its employees external hard drives for data backups. (GE 6 \nat 27; Tr. 40) When the investigator asked Applicant during his interview why he used a \npersonal device for his information device rather than the device that his company issued, \nApplicant explained that he needed a second backup in the event that he lost the primary \nbackup while traveling or working from home. (GE 6 at 27) This explanation made no sense to \neither the director of capture management or the investigator. (GE 6 at 27) At the conclusion \nof the investigation in August 2017, the capture management manager was still reviewing the \ncontents of the downloaded files and continuing to discover sensitive proprietary information. \n(GE 4 at 3 \nBy the time the investigation was completed, Applicant had retired, left the company, and \nbegun working for his current employer. (GE 1 at 11) The investigator had retrieved the \nexternal drive from Applicant and wiped it shortly after initiating the investigation. (Tr. 58) The \njob Applicant took after retiring from his previous employer was director-level, a position that \npaid substantially more money than his previous position. (GE 2 at 7) Applicant informed \nhis current supervisor of the episode.  (Tr. 28) \nApplicant characterizes his conduct as a good-faith mistake in judgment when he \nassumed that all of the information was his personal intellectual property rather than his \nemployer\u2019s intellectual property. Moreover, he contends that he had no intention of \ndamaging his company financially by sharing its intellectual property with competitors \nbecause \u201cthat\u2019s where [his] pension is coming from.\u201d (Tr. 29) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in his community. He is active in his \nchurch, and spends hours working with youth in the community, coaching basketball and \nleading a Cub Scout troop. (AE C, D) According to a current coworker, his compliance with \nregulations is exceptional. (AE A) Another coworker characterized him as \u201ca person of \nextreme integrity.\u201d (AE E) A coworker from his previous job characterized him as \u201chonest, \nconscientious, dedicated, and helpful.\u201d (AE B) According to Applicant\u2019s wife, he is an \nextremely meticulous individual who organizes playbooks for the youth teams he coaches and \nannotates the repair manuals for their home appliances. (AE D) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, \n528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \n \n3 \n\n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1   \nAnalysis \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nUnder this guideline, \u201cdeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information --- which includes classified and other \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the l kelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n5 \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information --- raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d (AG \u00b6 33) Applicant\u2019s transfer of 9,000 \nfiles from his work network to a personal external drive, in violation of company regulation, \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 34(e), \u201cloading drafting, editing, modifying, storing, \ntransmitting, or otherwise handling protected information, including images, on any \nunauthorized equipment or medium.\u201d \nApplicant has enjoyed a successful career, and is highly respected in the \ncommunity. The episode that forms the basis of the SOR was the only failure of handling \nprotected information in Applicant\u2019s 37-year career, and more than four years have elapsed \nsince its occurrence. Conversely, his security misuse of information technology was \negregious, as he downloaded sensitive information in violation of company regulation, \ncontinuing to do so despite a warning banner that appeared on his computer screen \ninforming him that his action was inappropriate. Moreover, both the investigator and the \ndirector of capture management questioned the credibility of his explanation as to why he did \nnot simply back up the information that he thought was personal on the external drives that \ntheir employers issued to employees. Under these circumstances, although AG \u00b6 35 (a), \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is partially applicable, insofar as the \nincident was isolated, and several years have elapsed since it occurred, the nature and \nseriousness of the incident continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s security-clearance \nworthiness. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern regarding \nhandling protected information. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or abilit y to \nproperty protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39) Applicant\u2019s \nconduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 40(d), \u201cdownloading, storing, or transmitting \nclassified, sensitive, proprietary, or other protected information on or to any unauthorized \ninformation technology system,\u201d and AG \u00b6 40(f), \u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of \nhardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any information technology system when \nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized.\u201d Applicant\u2019s conduct is disqualifying under this guideline for the same reasons \nthat it is disqualifying under the handling of protected guidelines, as discussed above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant\u2019s career has been impressive. For the past four years, he has been \nworking in a more lucrative position with greater responsibilities than the job that he held with \nhis previous employer. This positive attributes, however, are outweighed by the nature and \nseriousness of Applicant\u2019s misuse of information technology. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His 2016 Federal and state income tax returns were filed in a \ntimely fashion. Resulting security concerns were not mitigated. Based upon a review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 15, 2019. (Government Exhibit 1.) On March 10, 2020, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 7, 2020, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The Government was ready to proceed on June 29, 2020. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 10, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an initial notice of hearing on September 29, 2020. After a \ncontinuance due to Covid-19, the hearing was scheduled for December 7, 2020. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through H, which were also admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 6, 2021. Applicant \nrequested the record remain open for receipt of additional information. On December 9, \n2020; January 4, 2021; and January 12, 2021, Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits I \nthrough P, which were also admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 35 years old and single. He has a Bachelor of Science degree and has \nworked for his current employer since 2020. He has worked in the defense industry since \n2008 and held a security clearance the majority of that time. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections 12, 13A and 17; Tr. 6, 13.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations (1.a and 1.b), with explanations. \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax returns in a \ntimely manner for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016. (In his Answer Applicant incorrectly \nstated 2017 instead of 2016. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 23-24.)) \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his state income tax returns in a timely \nmanner for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016. (In his Answer Applicant incorrectly stated \n2017 instead of 2016. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 23-24.)) \nIn Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) Applicant admitted that \nhe had not filed Federal or state taxes for at least tax year 2013. He further stated in the \nquestionnaire, \u201cIt is my understanding that the taxes were not owed based on normal \npaycheck withholding and exemptions/credits from previous years.\u201d The questionnaire \nthen asked what actions Applicant had taken. He stated, \u201cNo action has been taken as it \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nis assumed no amount is owed and only a filing is required. I intend to back-file for the \napplicable years as soon as possible.\u201d (See also Tr. at 29.) \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on February 14, 2019. During that interview Applicant was asked \nabout his failure to file Federal or state tax returns for 2013, 2014, and 2016. The report \nstated, \u201cSubject [Applicant] filed tax extensions for each year but has not filed the required \nfollow-up. Subject did not follow up on sending in the taxes due to oversight. . . . Subject \nknows he is responsible for filing and will attempt to bring everything up to date by \nFebruary 2019.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.) \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s 2016 Federal and state tax returns. After the hearing \nApplicant provided documentation from the IRS and his state tax agency showing that \nthose returns were filed in a timely fashion in 2017. (Applicant Exhibits I and P.) \nWith regard to his 2013 and 2014 Federal and state tax returns, Applicant admitted \nthat he intended to file them from 2015 on, but it became too hard \u201cbecause of my job \nduties, the amount of time I spend on the job, the amount of time I spend on travel.\u201d In \nfact, Applicant\u2019s dilatory conduct with regard to the tax returns continued even after he \nreceived the Statement of Reasons. (Tr. 24.) (See Applicant Exhibits A, B, and C; Tr. 64\u00ad\n65.) \nAccording to Applicant, he finally filed his Federal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in \nMay 2020. However, there is no confirmation from the IRS that they were actually \nreceived and Applicant did not follow up as of the date of the hearing. After the hearing \nApplicant submitted a written statement saying that he had contacted the IRS on \nDecember 9, 2020. He had checked their website and these two tax returns were not \nshowing as filed. A representative allegedly told Applicant it was possible that the IRS \nhad received them, but due to Covid-19 the returns had not yet been entered into the IRS \ndata base. No further information was provided. (Applicant Exhibits D and O; Tr. 28-29, \n52-53, 65-66.) \nApplicant did not file his state 2013 and 2014 tax returns in May 2020, at the same \ntime he allegedly filed his Federal tax returns. Rather, according to Applicant, his filing of \nthese returns was complicated by a proposed assessment from the state. After some \nquestioning from Department Counsel about the current status of the returns, Applicant \nrevealed that he had not filed his state tax returns, but they were actually sitting in his car \nto be mailed after his hearing. (Tr. 35-36, 56-58.) \nThe reason for his dilatoriness was described by Applicant as follows: \nWell, that\u2019s because my - - what I intended to do here wasn\u2019t necessarily to \nshow that I had fully filed everything and closed everything out - - but that I \nwas making efforts to address them, beginning with my Federal Forms and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthen also with the State Form portion that I file today and then the last step \nwould be any adjustments or priorities. (Tr. 57.) \nAfter the hearing Applicant submitted documentation from the state tax authority \nshowing that his 2013 and 2014 returns were received on December 10, 2020. (Applicant \nExhibit P.) \nApplicant\u2019s attention was also drawn to several delinquent accounts that were \nfound on his credit report and had been outstanding for a considerable period of time. \nApplicant submitted evidence that he had resolved those issues after the hearing. \nHowever, once again, Applicant was dilatory in resolving these items. (Government \nExhibits 3, 4, and 5; Applicant Exhibits K, L, M, N, and O; Tr. 39-45.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation for employment from former co\u00ad\nworkers. He also submitted his evaluations from his former employer. These documents \nshow that he is a respected person in his field of endeavor. (Applicant Exhibits E, F, and \nG; Tr. 30-35.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:   \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, as required, for \nat least two years, 2013 and 2014. Applicant showed that he had filed his 2016 Federal \nand state tax returns in a timely fashion. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying condition, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not file two years of Federal and state income tax returns in a timely \nfashion. He has known for close to two years of the Government\u2019s concerns, but his \nconduct in resolving these concerns has been lackadaisical at best. He finally filed the \nFederal returns in May of 2020, but he was unable to provide confirmation of that fact \nbecause he did not contact the IRS until after the hearing. The state returns, which were \nin his car at the time of the hearing, were actually filed the next day. His testimony and \nwritten statements are replete with almost non-sensical explanations and prevarications \nabout why he was so delinquent in filing tax returns for these two years. Applicant has \nvirtually no track record of timely filing his tax returns. Filing the tax returns at issue did \nnot become Applicant\u2019s priority until he literally was in the hearing room. It is simply too \nsoon to conclude that he is a capable steward of classified information. His unwillingness \nto abide by income tax rules and regulations that apply to all cast doubt on his reliability \nand trustworthiness. Applicant did not mitigate the concerns over his income tax issues. \nGuideline F is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that he would file his tax returns in a timely manner in the \nfuture. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, \nthe evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 42 years old. She is a college graduate. She married in 2005 and divorced in 2019. She has one child, age seven, from the marriage. She has been employed by her present employer since March 2018. (Tr. 17-19) In October 2017, Applicant separated from her husband who was participating in an alcohol and drug rehabilitation program. He left it early and had his girlfriend pick him up from the location. Applicant was in an abusive marriage and at that point she decided to leave it. She filed for divorce the same month. Her husband is remarried and has a new family. Applicant credibly testified that her husband took responsibility in the marriage for filing their federal and state income tax returns and paying their taxes. She learned through discovery as part of her divorce that he failed to file their 2015 and 2016 federal and state tax returns. (Tr. 19-25) As part of Applicant\u2019s and her husband\u2019s divorce decree, he was ordered to file their 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal and state tax returns as \u201cmarried filing jointly.\u201d It was also ordered that he would be responsible for 60% of the tax liability, and Applicant would be responsible for the remaining 40%.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 22, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 18, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2021. The \n1 Applicant changed her last and middle name after her divorce. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February \n5, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 23, 2021. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through F. The record \nwas held open for Applicant to submit additional exhibits. She timely submitted AE G. \nHearing Exhibit I is Department Counsel\u2019s email noting he had no objection. There were \nno objections to any exhibits and all exhibits were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on March 3, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d and denied the \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. She is a college graduate. She married in 2005 and \ndivorced in 2019. She has one child, age seven, from the marriage. She has been \nemployed by her present employer since March 2018. (Tr. 17-19) \nIn October 2017, Applicant separated from her husband who was participating in \nan alcohol and drug rehabilitation program. He left it early and had his girlfriend pick him \nup from the location. Applicant was in an abusive marriage and at that point she decided \nto leave it. She filed for divorce the same month. Her husband is remarried and has a \nnew family. Applicant credibly testified that her husband took responsibility in the marriage \nfor filing their federal and state income tax returns and paying their taxes. She learned \nthrough discovery as part of her divorce that he failed to file their 2015 and 2016 federal \nand state tax returns. (Tr. 19-25) \nAs part of Applicant\u2019s and her husband\u2019s divorce decree, he was ordered to file \ntheir 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal and state tax returns as \u201cmarried filing jointly.\u201d It was \nalso ordered that he would be responsible for 60% of the tax liability, and Applicant would \nbe responsible for the remaining 40%. He did not file the 2015 and 2016 returns until July \n2018 and November 2018, respectively. Applicant testified that he prepared the 2017 tax \nreturns, and she signed them electronically, but he did not file them as so ordered. Later \nshe learned that he filed them as \u201csingle.\u201d (Tr. 19-25; Answer; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s attorney was forced to file motions to show cause with the court to \nenforce the terms of the divorce decree. The judge subsequently ordered Applicant to file \nher 2017 tax returns as \u201chead of household,\u201d which she did in February 2020, immediately \nafter her court date. She repeatedly contacted the IRS to confirm receipt of her tax returns, \nbut due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown it was difficult to get a response. In \nSeptember 2020, after Applicant\u2019s inquiry, the IRS confirmed it did not receive the returns. \nApplicant resent the tax returns by certified mail and receipt was confirmed. (Tr. 23-29; \nAnswer; GE 2) \nApplicant began paying her share of the delinquent federal taxes for 2015 in \nSeptember 2018. She paid the entire federal tax liability. Her ex-husband failed to pay \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany of his share. Applicant testified that she repeatedly had to go to court to enforce the \nterms of their divorce decree. She believed her ex-husband was aware that her finances \nand tax liability would jeopardize her security clearance, and he was deliberately and \nintentionally creating financial roadblocks for her to be vindictive. She paid her share of \nthe 2016 federal tax debt, but her ex-husband failed to pay his share until December \n2020. Applicant\u2019s 2015 and 2016 federal tax debts are resolved. (Tr. 19-26, 33-35; AE C, \nD) \nApplicant owes federal income taxes for 2017 in the approximate amount of \n$25,000, which includes penalties and interest. She explained the amount owed was \nimpacted because when she separated from her husband, she was unemployed and had \nno money. She withdrew money from her 401K pension plan and incurred the additional \ntax liability for early withdrawal. She used this money to support herself and her son. She \ndid not receive any child support from her husband from October 2017 until February \n2018. She became employed in March 2018. Applicant timely filed her 2018 and 2019 \nfederal and state income tax returns and her refunds were applied to her tax debts. (Tr. \n27-33, 44-46; AE A, B, F) \nApplicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in October 2020. She \nstated that direct withdrawals were supposed to begin in December 2020 or January \n2021, but they did not, so she has been making the required payments manually. She \nstated that she began making payments to the IRS before she had an installment \nagreement because she was aware that she had a tax liability for 2017 that had to be \npaid. She has been pleading with her ex-husband to begin making his share of the \npayments, but he refuses. (Tr. 26-29; AE A, B, F) \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s 2015 and 2016 state tax liability, she testified that she paid \nthose tax liabilities right after the returns were filed. She paid the whole amount owed. \nHer ex-husband did not pay his share. She has a payment plan with the state to pay her \n2017 state tax liability. She has been making $500 monthly payments since December \n2020, and the debt will be completely resolved in May 2021. She timely filed and paid her \n2018 and 2019 state income tax returns. Refunds were applied to the balance owed for \npast years. (Tr. 35-38; AE E, G) \nApplicant testified that she and her ex-husband own two properties, their former \nmarital residence and a rental property. He lives in the marital residence. In the divorce \ndecree, he was ordered to refinance the residence and remove Applicant from the \nproperty\u2019s title. Applicant was ordered to do the same for the rental property. She has \nmaintained the mortgage on the rental property. He failed to pay the mortgage on the \nresidence for numerous months and just prior to foreclosure he brought the loan current. \nA lien was placed on the property due to his failure to pay his taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Because \nApplicant\u2019s name is still on the title of the residential property, her husband\u2019s delinquency \nin paying the mortgage, has impacted Applicant\u2019s ability to obtain a loan to refinance the \nmortgage on the rental property. She discussed her financial situation with a prospective \nlender who advised her that she would not be eligible to refinance the rental property loan \nuntil there was 12 months of timely mortgage payments on the marital property. Applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas no control over those payments and is frustrated that she cannot resolve the transfer \nof ownership on the properties due to her ex-husband\u2019s actions. She intends to refinance \nthe rental property as soon as she is permitted. (Tr. 39-44) \nApplicant credibly testified that she lives within her means and does not have any \nother outstanding debts. She has had some financial counseling through her accountant \nand family to ensure that she is proceeding correctly in resolving her tax issues. She \nintends to complete the IRS installment agreement and rebuild her savings. She has a \nbudget. Prior to her divorce, she had an outstanding credit rating and intends to works \ntowards rehabilitating it. She does not intend to make any nonessential purchases until \nher tax debt is paid. Applicant stated that except for her poor choice in whom she married, \nthe financial problems were beyond her control, but she is working hard to rectify and pay \nthe remaining tax owed. (Tr. 38, 46-47) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file and pay her 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal and state \nincome tax returns. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying condition. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant believed her 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal and state income tax returns \nwere timely filed by her husband. After she separated from him, she learned he did not \nfile them. The divorce decree ordered her to pay 40% of the tax debts. She has paid the \nentire amount owed on the federal tax debt for tax year 2015 and her share of the 2016 \nfederal tax debt. She paid the entire amount owed for state taxes owed for 2015 and 2016 \ntax years. Her ex-husband did not pay as required. Her ex-husband has repeatedly been \nuncooperative, requiring her to seek legal action to enforce their divorce decree. She \nbelieves he is intentionally attempting to disrupt her ability to resolve the issues to be \nvindictive. Despite that, she has installment agreements with the IRS and her state tax \nauthority and is making payments to resolve the remaining 2017 tax debt. Her financial \nproblems were beyond her control, and she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She has received some financial counseling and is adhering to a good-\nfaith effort to resolve her tax debt. She has timely filed her 2018 and 2019 federal and \nstate income tax returns and has no other outstanding debts. It is unlikely there will be a \nrecurrence of any financial or tax issues. Her behavior does not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 62 years old; he has been divorced three times and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984 and a master\u2019s degree in 1989. Applicant has worked as a federal contractor since at least 2000 and has been with his current employer since 2017. (Item 3) Applicant has held a DoD security clearance since August 2000. In May 2010, he completed a security clearance application (SCA) incident to his periodic reinvestigation. In it, Applicant disclosed illegal drug use in 2002, specifically approximately 10 uses of marijuana and one use of cocaine. He was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2010, confirmed the drug use as disclosed, and explained that he used the drugs while on a six-month sabbatical in Aruba. In his adopted summary of that interview, Applicant denied any drug use since 2002, citing his concerns about the legal ramifications and the potential impact on his security clearance. He stated his intent not to use drugs in the future, citing again to his concern regarding his security clearance. His clearance was adjudicated favorably. (Items 3, 4, 5) In October 2017, Applicant completed another SCA. In it, he again disclosed the drug use in Aruba.

He was afforded an opportunity to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file \nobjections to the Government\u2019s evidence, nor submit any evidence. Items 2-5 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on November 3, \n2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old; he has been divorced three times and has no children. \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984 and a master\u2019s degree in 1989. Applicant has \nworked as a federal contractor since at least 2000 and has been with his current employer \nsince 2017. (Item 3) \nApplicant has held a DoD security clearance since August 2000. In May 2010, he \ncompleted a security clearance application (SCA) incident to his periodic reinvestigation. \nIn it, Applicant disclosed illegal drug use in 2002, specifically approximately 10 uses of \nmarijuana and one use of cocaine. He was interviewed by a government investigator in \nAugust 2010, confirmed the drug use as disclosed, and explained that he used the drugs \nwhile on a six-month sabbatical in Aruba. In his adopted summary of that interview, \nApplicant denied any drug use since 2002, citing his concerns about the legal \nramifications and the potential impact on his security clearance. He stated his intent not \nto use drugs in the future, citing again to his concern regarding his security clearance. His \nclearance was adjudicated favorably. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nIn October 2017, Applicant completed another SCA. In it, he again disclosed the \ndrug use in Aruba. Additionally, he disclosed \u201crandom and rare use of marijuana\u201d between \nJanuary 2012 and July 2016, estimating that he used marijuana fewer than five times and \nacknowledging that he held a security clearance at the time. Applicant noted his intent \nnot to use marijuana in the future, stating: \u201c[t]he legal and professional risks are too great. \nMarijuana use is simply not that important to me.\u201d (Item 3) \nIn September 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. In the \nadopted summary of that interview, he confirmed use of marijuana between 2012 and \n2016, estimated that he used no more than ten times, and explained that all uses took \nplace with a friend who was using marijuana for medicinal purposes. Applicant used \nmarijuana provided by his friend and only in his friend\u2019s home. He acknowledged that he \nwas in his mid-50s on these occasions and cited to immaturity. Applicant stated that he \nhad not used any drugs in three or four years and that he did not intend to use in the \nfuture because the risks were too great.

I \nhave not considered this conduct for disqualifying purposes, but may consider it in \napplying mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant smoked marijuana while holding a security clearance. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s initial alleged use of marijuana was twenty years ago and appears to \nhave been somewhat isolated, in that he then stopped using for about ten years. \nHowever, his renewed use after his 2010 security clearance adjudication raises significant \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, his reliability, and his ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. In 2010, Applicant explicitly stated his \nawareness of the legal risks of continued drug use and specifically cited the risk to his \nsecurity clearance. When he started using marijuana again in 2012, Applicant was in his \nmid-50s. His use was neither experimental nor a product of youthful indiscretion. \nApplicant\u2019s continued conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. His pattern of illegal drug use is not mitigated. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable, \nand AG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing;  \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in\nthat country; \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States; \nApplicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use is cross-alleged under Guideline E. That conduct \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nIt also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since July 2016. The discussion above under \ndrug involvement and substance misuse applies equally here. Applicant is commended \nfor his candor throughout the security clearance adjudication process, which reduces his \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. Nonetheless, the conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 62 years old. He has a lengthy history of using illegal drugs \nsporadically from 2001 to 2016 while holding a security clearance. In 2010, he met with \na government investigator and expressed his sincere intent not to use drugs again, and \nhis clearance was favorably adjudicated. Regrettably, Applicant proved unable or \nunwilling to adhere to his stated intent. Over a span of more than four years, he repeatedly \ndecided not to comply with the law and with DoD\u2019s rules surrounding drug use. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not file his federal (SOR 1.a) or state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2016 tax year; and that he owes $9,045 for 12 past-due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.c \u2013 1.n). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the Guideline F allegations. (FORM, Item 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since May 2018. In his e-QIP, he disclosed that he had not filed his federal or state income tax returns for the 2016 tax year, but stated that he would file those returns \u201cwithin the three-year deadline.\u201d He has not produced any information showing that his past-due returns have been filed. (FORM, Item 2) Applicant did not disclose any other adverse financial information in his e-QIP. During his background investigation, government investigators obtained credit reports in January and September 2019 that document all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant has not produced any information regarding the current status of his debts.

After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) could not \ndetermine that it was clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have access to classified information, as required by Executive Order 10865, as \namended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \nOn November 13, 2019, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were \nissued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, to be effective \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the SOR \n(Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing. \nOn May 25, 2021, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that was received by Applicant on July 1, 2021. The \nFORM contained five exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 5) on which the Government relies to support \nthe SOR allegations. In the FORM, Department Counsel amended the SOR, as provided \nfor by paragraph E3.1.13 of the Directive, by withdrawing the Guideline E allegations. \nApplicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit \nadditional information. He did not submit anything further and the record closed on July \n31, 2021. I received the case for decision on October 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not file his federal (SOR\n1.a) or state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2016 tax year; and that he owes $9,045\nfor 12 past-due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.c \u2013 1.n). In response to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted all of the Guideline F allegations. (FORM, Item 2) In addition to the facts\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since May 2018. In his e-QIP, he disclosed that he had not filed his federal or \nstate income tax returns for the 2016 tax year, but stated that he would file those returns \n\u201cwithin the three-year deadline.\u201d He has not produced any information showing that his \npast-due returns have been filed. (FORM, Item 2) \nApplicant did not disclose any other adverse financial information in his e-QIP. \nDuring his background investigation, government investigators obtained credit reports in \nJanuary and September 2019 that document all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant \nhas not produced any information regarding the current status of his debts. Available \ninformation does not show that he has acted to repay or otherwise resolve his debts, or \nthat he has obtained any financial counseling or other professional financial assistance. \nFinally, he has not presented any information about his current finances. (FORM, Items \n4 and 5) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that Applicant still has not filed his 2016 income tax \nreturns. It also shows that he still owes $9,045 for 12 delinquent or past-due debts. This \ninformation reasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 \n18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Government\u2019s information presents a prima facie case for disqualification. \nAccordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. He did not do so. The \nrecord does not support any of the cited mitigating conditions. Applicant did not meet his \nburden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification from access \nto classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \npresents unresolved doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. His ongoing financial problems leave him at risk of engaging in unacceptable \nconduct to resolve his debts. Further, his apparent lack of action in that regard reflects \nadversely on his judgment. Because protection of the national interest is the principal \nfocus in these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against allowing \naccess to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a - n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, six siblings, and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. His father-in-law is a retired senior officer in the Afghan military. The \npotential for terrorist and other violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin Afghanistan, and it continues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying \nconditions have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in \nAfghanistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. The Appeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of \nlimited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar \nmanner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous \ntrack record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the \nnational security. See, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed \nthis issue as follows: \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist in support of the U.S. \nmission from 2008 to 2012, which earned him a special immigrant visa. He returned to \nAfghanistan and is again supporting the U.S. military. I find that Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan earned him a special \nimmigrant visa. He is once again in Afghanistan in support of the U.S. military. The \nAppeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the \nUnited States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant in a \nGuideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). The \ncomplicated state of affairs in Afghanistan places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his family members in Afghanistan do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. He has met that burden. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On January 3, 2020, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence and \nGuideline F, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) dated June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 3, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 11, 2020. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on September 29, \n2020, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 13, 2020. \nThe \nGovernment offered eleven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 11, \n1 \n\n \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered seven exhibits at the \nhearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left open until close of \nbusiness on January 27, 2021, to allow Applicant to submit additional supporting \ndocumentation. Applicant submitted no additional documentation. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 23, 2020. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided a seven page summary of \nthe facts, supported by eight Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan. The \ndocuments provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative \nnotice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. (HE-I) They are limited to \nmatters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the \nFindings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old and is married with children. He has an Associate \ndegree in Criminal Justice. He is employed with a defense contractor as a linguist. He \nis seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \nApplicant was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. \nAt the age of six, he moved to \nPakistan where he lived for about ten years. He then moved to the United States in \n2001, where he lived with his brother and grandfather. He went to college and obtained \na degree. In 2011, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He married in 2005. \nHis wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  They have three native-born American children. \nApplicant began working for the Defense Department, and served two successful \ntours as a linguist alongside U.S. forces in combat zones in 2011 and 2013. He was \nalso deployed overseas for a period in 2019. He has outstanding references from his \nprevious mission assignment demonstrating outstanding competence on all levels. \nApplicant was hired by his current employer in April 2019, and is currently applying for \nan upgraded linguist position, requiring a security clearance. \nIn 2011, Applicant\u2019s mother, father and sister all resided in and were citizens of \nAfghanistan. Applicant denies these allegations in response to the SOR under this \nguideline, as situations have changed. Applicant\u2019s parents are now both naturalized \nU.S. citizens, and they live in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s mother became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in March 2019. \nApplicant provided a copy of her valid U.S. \npassport. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nSince December 2019, Applicant\u2019s father is also a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. Prior to moving to the United States, Applicant\u2019s father was \nemployed as a Police Officer in Afghanistan. He is now retired. Applicant provided a \n2 \n\n \ncopy of his father\u2019s certificate of U.S. naturalization. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) Applicant\u2019s \nsister, who at one time was a resident and citizen of Afghanistan, is now a citizen of the \nNetherlands, where she currently resides. Applicant provided a copy of her Netherlands \npassport. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nDuring his security clearance background investigation, Applicant was asked if \nhe will inherit any property in Afghanistan. (Government Exhibit 5.) Applicant testified \nthat he no longer stands to inherit property owned by his father or anyone else in \nAfghanistan. His father is currently in good health. Applicant further testified that the \nvalue of any property owned by his father in Afghanistan is insignificant compared to \nwhat Applicant owns in the United States. Applicant states that he will not lay claim to \nany property in any foreign country. Furthermore, Applicant has no interest in ever \nmoving back to Afghanistan to live or retire.  (Tr. p. 47.) \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nApplicant is indebted to ten creditors listed in the SOR, totaling approximately \n$100,000. He admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline, \nexcept allegations 1.a, and 1.j. His financial distress began in about November or \nDecember 2015. At that time he was not earning sufficient monies to pay his bills. His \nwife owned a rental property in a location that encountered a gas leak and ultimately \ncaused the tenants to move. Applicant\u2019s wife was pregnant with their second child. \nApplicant had just started renovating their primary residence. The snowball effect of \nthis situation caused many of his financial troubles. Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated October 13, 2018; August 21, 2019; March 10, 2020; and November 11, 2020, \nconfirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and 11.)  \nThe following debts became delinquent and are of security significance: 2.a. A \nmortgage account was past due in the amount of $34,683 with a total balance of \n$325,940. \n2.b. \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $36,244 was also \ndelinquent. 2.c. A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $18,810. \n2.d. A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $16,553. 2.e. A debt \nowed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of $14,375. \nApplicant \nbelieves the debt has been settled but provides no documentary evidence to support \nthis assertion. (Tr. p. 61.) 2.f.  A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \namount of $9,967. 2.g. A debt was owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of \n$3,181. 2.h. A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $2,132. 2.i. A \ndebt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $1,087. 2.j. A judgment was \nentered against the Applicant in 2018 in the amount of $3,168. This debt has been paid \nin full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.) \nApplicant explained that his mortgage fell in arrears, and a number of credit \ncards became delinquent. Since then, Applicant has brought his mortgage to a current \nstatus, and he is steadily reducing his HOA indebtedness. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) In \nJanuary 2017, to avoid foreclosure, Applicant hired a credit repair company to assist \nhim in resolving his delinquent debt. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) At that time, they set up a \nfinancial plan that illuminated non-necessary expenditures and focused on his most \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nimportant debts first. \nApplicant started the plan, and he believes that he made \nsignificant headway, but was unable to complete it due to another unexpected financial \nhit. \nSince April 2019, Applicant has been gainfully employed. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)  \nHe states that he has tried to resolve his delinquent debt, but has encountered \ndifficulties. \nTo avoid bankruptcy, in November 2019, Applicant hired another debt \nmanagement company. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) He states that this company has been \nhelpful. He believes that they are negotiating with the creditors to reduce the amount of \nthe debts owed. (Tr. p. 59.) He also stated that they have been placed him on a \npayment plan to avoid Bankruptcy. (Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR.) However, due to \nthe pandemic, from March through July 2020, as Applicant has been on leave from \nwork, awaiting his security clearance hearing, he has not had the money to pay his \npast-due debts. He states that he received a salary from his employer until July 2020. \nGiven the circumstances, Applicant has been unable to resolve his debts. \nApplicant states that he intends to resolve each of the delinquent debts listed in \nthe SOR. Applicant contends that some of the debts listed in the SOR are no longer \nowing, as they are old debts, and were incurred before he worked for the Defense \nDepartment, and are no longer showing delinquent on his credit report. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit G.) Other debts listed in the SOR are still owing, and he plans to pay them \nwhen he has the money to do so. \nLetters of recommendation from military and professional associates of the \nApplicant indicate that he is considered to be an outstanding linguist. \nHe has \nconsistently demonstrated \u201cexceptional linguist skills and cultural expertise, as well as \nloyalty and dedication to the U.S. and their missions in his position, both on and off \nduty.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s linguist capabilities and cultural expertise have allowed military \nmissions to achieve great headway with Afghan partners. Moreover, Applicant is said to \nhave been resilient despite the tragedies of war he has experienced. He is highly \nrecommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \ncountry of Afghanistan, which include the Government\u2019s briefs and supportive \ndocuments on the country of Afghanistan. In 2001, the United States led a coalition to \nremove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains an important \npartner with the United States in the fight against terrorism, and has been designated a \nMajor Non-NATO Ally. However, numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the \nU.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Afghans. Even with \naggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan \nremains high. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services. In summary, Afghanistan provides a significant and heightened \nsecurity risk to the United States. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family relatives include his mother and father, who were at \none time residents and citizens of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s sister was also a citizen and \nresident of Afghanistan. At that time, Applicant\u2019s foreign connections could have posed \na security risk. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and two of them are applicable in this case. \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are now U.S. citizens and they reside in the United States. \nHis sister is now a citizen and resident of the Netherlands. \nApplicant\u2019s ties to \nAfghanistan are now based solely upon where he was born and the unique skills and \ncultural knowledge he brings to the United States. His parents have now made the \nUnited States their permanent home. Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts do not pose a heightened security risk for the United States Government. \nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives, namely his parents, are U.S. Citizens \nand reside here. His sister is a citizen and resident of the Netherlands. His parents are \nnot affiliated in any way with the Afghan government. Furthermore, other than those \ncontacts that have been established through his work as a linguist, Applicant has no \nfamily members or friends or associates of any kind in Afghanistan. Applicant has \nshown that he can be trusted.  His past record of performance demonstrates that he has \nalready served in combat zones with our military missions and has done an exemplary \njob. \nIt is recognized that Applicant is at a higher risk of being targeted by Afghan \nextremists in an effort to gather American intelligence. However, except for his sister in \nthe Netherlands, Applicant\u2019s family ties are here in the United States, and his loyalty \nand dedication is solid. \nApplicant is a naturalized American citizen. \nHe has \naccomplished his educational goals, has excelled at work, and has shown full allegiance \nto the United States. He has made many sacrifices by choosing to work in his position \nas a linguist in a war zone, which has proven to be very dangerous. In the past, \nApplicant has fulfilled his duties and responsibilities to protect the United States, our \nArmed Forces, and our mission. Thus, it can be assumed that he will continue to place \nthe interest of the U.S. paramount, and always protect the national interests of the U.S.  \nHe states that he will never do anything that could place the interests of the U.S. in \njeopardy. Under the circumstances, Applicant has met this burden and has established \nthe two mitigating conditions set forth above under Guideline B.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n7 \n\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. It is not clear from the record \nwhether he has lived beyond his means, or whether he simply has not earned enough \nmoney to support himself and his family modestly. Most of the debts listed in the SOR \nremain owing. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that he is \nfinancially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has financial resources \navailable to pay his past-due financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control, namely loss of employment, \ncontributed to his financial problems. He incurred excessive debt that he has not been \nable to pay. Today, he remains excessively indebted. Although Applicant appears to \nhave made some attempts to pay his debts, he has shown no significant progress. \nOther than bringing his mortgage current, there has been little or no change to his \nfinances for several years. Applicant claims that he is on a payment plan and working \nwith a debt management company, but provides no further detail about this in the \nrecord. It is not clear from the evidence whether Applicant has been able to resolve any \nmore than one or two of the debts listed in the SOR. \nAlthough he hired a debt \n8 \n\n \n \nmanagement firm to assist him in resolving his debt, and has expressed the intent to \npay his bills, there is inadequate evidence to show what if anything he has actually been \ndone. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that he is in control of his finances or that he \ncan pay his bills. Under the circumstances, Applicant has failed to meet his burden. \nNone of the mitigating conditions set forth above under Guideline F provide full \nmitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant served two successful tours as a linguist alongside U.S. forces in combat \nzones in 2011 and 2013. He was also deployed overseas for a period in 2019. He is \ncommended for his dedication to U.S. missions in the past. However, in regard to his \nfinances, Applicant has fallen short. He has not shown that he is financially responsible \nat the level of responsibility required in holding a security clearance.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns. The Foreign Influence security concern has been mitigated. \n9 \n\nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, through 1.d.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b through 2.f.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.h. through 2.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.j. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

From about 2011 through June 2015, he used \nthe following hallucinogenic controlled substances: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), \nmushrooms, and DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine). He used LSD about three times, \nmushrooms twice, and DMT about eleven times. He bought the LSD, was given the \nmushrooms, and manufactured the DMT.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, Adderall, LSD, mushrooms, and DMT. \nHe sold marijuana and he helped manufacture DMT. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant was raised in a family where illegal drug use was commonplace. He \nstarted smoking marijuana in 2008 when he was about 17 years old. His drug \ninvolvement increased over the years to include use of other drugs, manufacturing \nDMT, and selling marijuana. In about March 2016, he realized he needed to make major \nchanges in his life if he wanted a successful future. He completely stopped all \ninvolvement with illegal drugs. He credibly testified that he will not use any illegal drugs \nin the future. He fully disclosed his drug use on his SF 86 and during his background \ninvestigation, which bolsters his credibility. Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious, but it was \nmore than five years ago. It no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an \nappropriate period, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) \nare applicable. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement was cross-alleged under criminal conduct. The \nabove disqualifying condition is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe discussion above under drug involvement and substance misuse applies \nequally here. I find evidence of successful rehabilitation; the conduct is unlikely to recur; \nand it no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement is cross-alleged under Guideline E. That conduct \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nApplicant still has contact with family members who use drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(e), and \n16(g) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant stopped participating in his drug activities more than five years ago. \nWhile he still has some contact with his family members who use drugs, if he sees any \ndrug use, he leaves. The discussion above under Guidelines H and J applies equally \nhere. I find that the conduct is unlikely to recur; it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; and it no longer serves as a \nbasis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(e), and 17(g) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct), H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and J (criminal conduct).  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information \nor to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 3, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why \nunder the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the preliminary \naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

Between December 2005 \nand September 2011, he was a self-employed handyman. (Items 2-3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nBetween December 2010 and October 2016, Applicant accumulated 35 \ndelinquent debts exceeding $26,000. (Items 3-5) Several of the debts represent \ndelinquent student loans. (SORs \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) Others represent delinquent medical debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h and 1.j-1.ii) The remaining three listed debts represent delinquent \nconsumer debts. (SORs \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e,1.i), and 1.ii)   \nApplicant\u2019s documented efforts to address the debts covered by the SOR are \nlimited to two small payments of $75 and $176, respectively, to the medical creditor \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61f-1.h and 1.j-1.gg).

The only other cited debt that he is addressing is a non-SOR car loan \nfor $9,681, which currently carries a reported reduced balance of $3,867. (Item 9) \nApplicant attributed his debt delinquencies in part to the burdens associated with \nfulfilling his child support obligations to his second wife and their two children imposed \nby the terms of his divorce decree. (Items 6-7) Under the terms of his divorce decree, \nApplicant became responsible for child support obligations in the monthly amount of \n$668 for the support of his two minor children (one of whom is now an adult), beginning \nJanuary 2014. (Items 6-7) \nBy all reported accounts, Applicant has been compliant with his child support \nterms. (Items 6-7). Applicant\u2019s divorce decree also obligated him to make monthly \nspousal support payments of $1,000, beginning in January 2014. (Items 6-7) Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports do not reveal any delinquencies in his child and spousal support \nobligations. \nAbsent documentation from Applicant\u2019s committing more of his resources to  \naddressing his delinquent accounts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.ii with pay-offs and \npayment plans, resolution of Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed accounts cannot be favorably \nestablished.  \nApplicant is highly regarded by his former military instructor, friends, and \ncoworkers who have worked with him and know him to be dedicated, accountable, \nreliable, and trustworthy. (Item 11) Whether any of his character references are aware \nof his past financial difficulties is unclear. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n                                         Financial Considerations \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. The AG guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                                             \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

Faced with increased financial outlays \nassociated with his imposed child and spousal support obligations, Applicant fell behind \nwith his other accounts. Based on these contributing factors, he is entitled to some \nextenuating credit. Mitigating Condition (MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nBecause Applicant has failed to address any of his accumulated delinquent \naccounts with the income resources available to him, the second prong of MC 20(b)), \n\u201cand the individual acted responsibly,\u201d is not available to him. With so little financial \ninformation to work with relative to the circumstances prompting him to fall behind with \nhis child support, student loan, and medical accounts with the income resources \navailable to him from his full-time employment, no meaningful extenuation credit can be \nassigned to him at this time. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of his current financial condition and \nexplanations of his lack of payment progress on his delinquent debts, Applicant \nprovided no persuasive clarifications or explanations for (a) how he allowed his debts to \nbecome delinquent with his past and current income available to him and (b) why he \nhas failed to take any documented steps to address his listed delinquent accounts to \ndate.

To be \nsure, Applicant is highly regarded by his former military instructor, friends, and \ncoworkers who have worked with him and know him to be dedicated, accountable, \nreliable, and trustworthy. \nNeither Applicant\u2019s favorable endorsements nor his credited military service and \ncontributions to the defense industry are enough at this time to overcome his \naccumulated delinquent debts and his lack of a meaningful track record for dealing with \nthem and maintaining responsible control of his finances. More time is needed for \nApplicant to regain established control of his finances, consistent with the minimum \nrequirements for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Dondi S. West, Esq. \n01/05/2021 \nDecision \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline I, \npsychological conditions. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 25, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline I, psychological conditions. \nThe DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \nOn January 17, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 26, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and \n\n \n2 \n \n \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 8, 2020, and the hearing was set for \nAugust 19, 2020. On August 16, 2020, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance, for \ngood cause shown, which was unopposed by Department Counsel. The motion was \ngranted. A second notice of hearing was issued by DOHA on October 7, 2020, setting \nthe hearing for October 22, 2020. On October 22, 2020, Appellant\u2019s counsel requested \na continuance based upon an emergency situation. The request was unopposed by \nDepartment Counsel and I granted it. On October 30, 2020, a hearing notice was issued \nsetting the hearing for November 6, 2020. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted into evidence without objection, except for GE 4, which \nwas objected to on the basis of relevancy. That objection was overruled. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I and the discovery letter \nwas marked as HE II. The Government also called one witness.  \n \nApplicant testified, offered one witness, and produced exhibits (AE) A and B, \nwhich were admitted. I also took administrative notice of a law review article and a \nFederal District Court case submitted by Applicant and marked as HE III and IV \n(California Law Review, Vol 62: 693-752; Taylor v. Comm., 2013 U.S. Dist. Lexis \n44339). At the close of the hearing I asked both counsel to submit a curriculum vitae \n(CV) for their respective expert witnesses, which they both did and the CVs were \nadmitted as GE 5 and AE 3. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November \n23, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted in part and denied in part both of the SOR \nallegations, with explanations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He is single, never married, and has no children. He \nhas worked for his current defense contractor-employee since 2009. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2004 and has never had a security incident or violation. He \nholds master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering and business administration. He has \nowned a home since December 2016. (Tr. at 108-111, 139; GE 1; AE B)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: (1) was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder \n(depressive type, with catatonia) and Non-adherence to Medical Treatment (by history) \nin August 2019 by a licensed clinical psychologist (Dr. 2), which are conditions that may \nimpair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness; and (2) has received mental \nhealth treatment since February 2010 from a psychiatrist (Dr. 1) and that in May 2017, \nthis provider indicated that Applicant had a condition that could impair judgment, \nreliability, or ability to properly safeguard classified information. The provider further \nstated that Applicant has psychotic symptoms if he stops taking his medication and \ngave a prognosis of \u201cguarded to fair.\u201d (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a). \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was hospitalized for the first time for a mental health issue. He \nwas working in a state away from where his parents lived and an acquaintance died, \nwhich caused Applicant to have a severe depressive episode. This caused his parents \nto go to Applicant\u2019s out-of-state location and see to his hospitalization. Applicant \ndescribed his actions at that time as being depressed, not talking, and \u201cjust shutting \ndown\u201d. No contemporaneous medical records are available to describe this incident, \nhowever, later medical records from 2009 and 2012 refer to the 2002 incident when \ndescribing Applicant\u2019s medical history with the information usually coming from either \nApplicant or his parents. The records refer to a psychotic incident occurring in 2002. \n(Note: None of the previous medical incidents in 2002, herein described, or in 2009 and \n2012, described below, were specifically alleged in the SOR, therefore, I will not use this \nevidence for disqualifying purposes, but I will consider it in the application of any \nmitigating conditions, whole-person factors, and in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility.) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s hospitalization, he returned to his parents\u2019 home state where he \nremained while finishing his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and his master\u2019s degree in 2006. \nApplicant also saw a psychiatrist for approximately three years and was prescribed \nZyprexa, Geodon, and Ativan. No diagnosis or prognosis was contained in the record \nfrom this time frame. Applicant testified that he came off the prescribed medicine in \n2005 because he was not seeing a doctor at the time and there was no requirement to \nstay on the medication. In July 2009, Applicant was employed at his current location, \nwhich required a move to a different state. (Tr. at 121-127; GE 1, 3, 4 (p. 40 of pp. 101) \n \n \nIn December 2009, Applicant experienced another psychological incident that \nresulted in a hospitalization. Records indicate that Applicant was seen standing outside \nhis home, unmoving, for approximately two hours. Medical personnel were alerted and \nhe was hospitalized where he presented with \u201cthought blocking, disorganized thought \nprocess, paranoia, and denial about his condition.\u201d His admission diagnosis was: mood \ndisorder NOS, a rule out of major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic \nfeatures, and a rule out of schizophrenia. (See: The criteria set forth in the Diagnostic \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)). At that time, he was \nprescribed Zyprexa and Ativan. He was hospitalized for approximately one week and \nupon discharge he returned with his parents to their home state where he remained for \nabout two months. His discharge diagnosis was: bipolar disorder, depressed, versus \nmajor depressive disorder with psychotic features and catatonia, most possibly \ndepressive disorder, severe, recurrent, with psychotic features. After his hospitalization, \nhe began therapy with two doctors (their specialties were not indicated in the record). In \neither late 2009 or early 2010, Applicant began seeing his current psychiatrist (Dr. 1) \nevery three months for medication management. (GE 2, 3, 4 (p. 36-38 of pp. 101); AE \nA) \n \n \nApplicant testified that leading up to his 2009 hospitalization he was unable to \nsleep for three days. As a result, he was not functioning well. He confirmed that he \nstood outside his home for some time until a neighbor saw him and called for help. He \nrecalls being admitted to the hospital and being diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and \ndepressive disorder. He was not on medication at the time of this incident, but during his \nhospitalization he was prescribed Geodon and Ativan. Sometime after this \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhospitalization, in early 2010, he began seeing his current psychiatrist, Dr. 1. During the \nearly part of his treatment by Dr. 1, he was seen more than once every three months. \nNow, the frequency of his appointments are about once every three months. He went to \nlive with his parents for about two months after his hospitalization. He then returned to \nwork with no repercussions from his hospitalization or his lengthy absence. (Tr. 127-\n130; GE 3; AE A. \n \n \nIn April 2012, Applicant was admitted to the hospital after a visit from his parents \nwho found him to be acting in an odd manner and took him to see his doctor. It was \ndiscovered that Applicant had not been to work for over a month and had lost a \nsignificant amount of weight. He also had stopped taking his prescribed medicine in \nMay 2011. He remained hospitalized for ten days and was given a discharge diagnosis \nof: major depression with psychotic features, schizophrenia also remains part of \ndifferential, and general anxiety disorder. He was prescribed Ziprasidone, Citalopram, \nBuspirone, and Ativan upon his discharge. During his testimony, Applicant admitted that \nhe stopped taking his medication because he thought he could manage his condition \nwithout the medication and because the medication led to significant weight gain. While \nhe continued to see Dr. 1 before this hospitalization he did not recall if he told Dr.1 that \nhe stopped taking his medication. He described his behavior which led to his \nhospitalization as \u201cshutting down.\u201d This resulted in him not going to work, not \ncommunicating with other people, and just staying in his house. He believes the only \ntrigger for this hospitalization was that he stopped taking his medication. He was put \nback on medication during and after this hospitalization. He again returned to work \nwithout any repercussions from his earlier missed time. Between 2012 and 2014, he \nwas not 100 percent compliant with taking his medication because he experienced side \neffects from it. Dr. 1 made an adjustment to his medication in 2014 and since then he \nhas been 100 percent compliant with taking the medication, which at this time only \nincludes taking Abilify for his mental health conditions. (Tr. at 130-135; GE 3, GE 4 (pp. \n56-59, 91-92 of 101); AE A) \n \n \nAs stated above, none of Applicant\u2019s three hospitalizations were specifically \nalleged in the SOR. I have described the uses I can make of this evidence (credibility, \napplication of mitigating conditions, and the whole-person factors). I will also consider \nthe evidence as background information as it may help explain or amplify the diagnoses \nthat have been alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nIn May 2017, as part of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, an investigator sent \nDr. 1 a questionnaire that asked the provider to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the question of \nwhether the Applicant had a condition that could impair his judgment, reliability, or ability \nto protect classified information. Dr. 1 answered \u201cyes.\u201d Dr. 1 was also asked to state the \nnature of the condition, which she stated as: \u201cHe has psychotic symptoms if he goes off \nof his medication.\u201d Dr. 1 stated that his prognosis was: \u201cguarded to fair.\u201d The period of \ntreatment was listed as February 23, 2010, to the present. As part of his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant included a letter by Dr. 1 from January 2020. In this letter, Dr. 1 \ndescribed her treatment of Applicant since February 2010, with his last appointment \ncoming in January 2020; that he has been psychiatrically stable since September 2014; \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand that he has been compliant in taking his medication and making every appointment \nsince September 2014. (GE2; Answer to SOR (See attachment labeled Exhibit A)) \n \n \nIn furtherance of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, the CAF contracted to \nhave Dr. 2 perform a psychological evaluation of Applicant. The examination was \nconducted in August 2019 and Dr. 2\u2019s report was completed in September 2019 (GE 3). \nDr. 2 also testified at Applicant\u2019s hearing. Dr. 2 is a Ph.D. (Doctor of philosophy) of \nclinical psychology. Her CV is part of the record. (GE 5) I find that Dr. 2 is a duly \nqualified mental health professional approved by the U.S. Government. (Tr. 19-22) \n \n \nAs part of her evaluation, Dr. 2 reviewed Applicant\u2019s medical records, conducted \na clinical interview with him, made clinical observations, and administered the \npersonality assessment inventory (PAI) test. Dr. 2 observed that Applicant arrived for \nhis appointment on time and appeared neat and clean. He seemed relaxed, with no \nobservable signs of anxiety or psychomotor agitation. Dr. 2 believed his insight and \nmemory were poor because he denied aspects of his mental health history believing \nthat he had a tendency to minimize the severity of his mental health condition by stating \nthat it was \u201cjust depression.\u201d He was respectful and cooperative throughout the \nevaluation and there were no attempts at deception. Dr. 2 noted that on one aspect of \nthe PAI test, Applicant indicated that he was portraying himself in an unrealistically \nfavorable light. Dr. 2 further stated that Applicant\u2019s inconsistent medication adherence \nand his ongoing denial about the severity of his condition places him at an increased \nrisk for future relapse. Dr. 2 stated that his diagnostic profile was: Schizoaffective \nDisorder (depressive type, with catatonia) and non-adherence to medical treatment (by \nhistory). Dr. 2 also noted that the risk of future psychotic episodes can be mitigated, \nprovided Applicant continues to take his prescribed medicine. She admitted that records \nindicate he has been medically compliant since 2014 and that there is no evidence of a \npsychotic episode since that time. Dr. 2 read Dr. 3\u2019s evaluation report, but nothing in it \ncaused her to change her opinion about Applicant\u2019s lack of insight that could result in \nhis future non adherence to taking his medication. (Tr. at 21-24, 27, 43; GE 3, 5)   \n \n \nIn August 2020, Applicant sought and participated in an independent \npsychological evaluation conducted by Dr. 3. Dr. 3 prepared a resulting evaluation \nreport in October 2020. (AE A) Dr. 3 also testified at Applicant\u2019s hearing. Dr. 3 is a \nPsyD. (Doctor of psychology) of clinical and forensic psychology. (Generally, Ph.D. \nprograms emphasize research, while PsyD. programs emphasize clinical work) Her CV \nis part of the record. (AE C) I find that Dr. 3 is a duly qualified mental health professional \nand because she has contracted with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and \nseveral state agencies to conduct psychological evaluations she is also approved by the \nU.S. Government. (Tr. 61-64; AE A, C) \n \n \nAs part of her evaluation of Applicant, Dr. 3 conducted a clinical interview, a \nmental status exam, a competency evaluation, a psychological assessment, records \nreview, and a series of psychological testing, including: the Reynolds Adaptable \nIntelligence Test (RAIT), Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-IV), Beck Anxiety \nInventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Adult Substance Abuse Subtle \n\n \n6 \n \n \nScreening Inventory-4 (SASSI-4). Dr. 3\u2019s evaluation report traces a very similar \npsychological history for Applicant as did Dr. 2. Some differences exist. Dr. 3 pointed \nout that Applicant has not been hospitalized since 2012 and that he has not received \nany reprimands or discipline from his employer. Dr. 3 also pointed out that Applicant has \nnot been violent or displayed any abnormal behavior since 2012. An evaluation of \nApplicant\u2019s MCMI test results showed, inter alia, an appropriate amount of self-\ndisclosure and that no defensive test-taking attitudes were apparent. Applicant was \ncooperative throughout the evaluation. Dr. 3 stated, \u201cThe personality assessment was \nconsistent with his presentation which is an individual who is guarded, shy, mostly \nintroverted and has low self-esteem.\u201d She also responded to Dr. 2\u2019s point that future \npsychotic episodes can be mitigated by continuing medication compliance by explaining \nthat Applicant\u2019s level of intelligence, positive family support, reliability, responsibility, and \nwork-related compliance are also mitigating factors. Dr. 3 related that Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnosis was a schizoaffective disorder (by history). She also offered a strong \nprognosis for Applicant based upon the level of support he receives from his parents \nand his continued compliance with taking his medication. Dr. 3 also opined that \nApplicant accepts his disorder and the need to stay on his medication and that the last \nsix to eight years of staying on his medication is evidence of his acceptance. (Tr. at 65-\n76, 93, 98, 101; AE A)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he realizes he has a mental health condition and takes it \nseriously. He also realizes he must continue to take his medication. To insure taking his \nmedication, he has developed a regular schedule for taking it, which he follows. He \nknows how important taking his medication is. If he stopped taking his medication, his \nsymptoms would recur, which could put him back into the hospital. He did not like his \nhospital experiences and wants to avoid those in the future. He believes his taking the \nmedication now is different than it was before when he stopped because now he has to \ntake other medications, not mental health-related, and he accepts taking medication as \na way to promote his overall health and wellbeing. The only mental health medication \nhe currently takes is Abilify and he takes it once in the evening as he has done since \n2014. (Tr. at 112-116, 141-142) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking \nmental health counseling.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. They are:   \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n \nDuring her closing argument, Department Counsel cited a DOHA Appeal Board \ncase for the proposition that an Applicant\u2019s procurement and evaluation by a \npsychological practitioner, which is deemed favorable, after the issuance of an SOR \nmay be self-serving in order to obtain a positive result. (ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at p. \n6, January 3, 2020) I believe the cited case is factually distinguishable from this case in \nthat in the cited case the applicant failed to cooperate with the Government-aligned \nevaluator, but cooperated completely with his own evaluator. In our case, the evidence \nestablishes Applicant\u2019s complete cooperation with both evaluators. Therefore, I do not \nfind that there is an inference that Applicant\u2019s procured psychological evaluation was \nself-serving. \n \nThe SOR only alleged the diagnoses by Dr. 1 and Dr. 2. Of the listed \ndisqualifying conditions, only AG \u00b6 28(b) applies in this case. No behavior was alleged \nin the SOR that would trigger the application of AG \u00b6 28(a), no hospitalization was \nalleged in the SOR to trigger application of AG \u00b6 28(c), and \u201cNon-adherence to Medical \nTreatment (by history).\u201d was alleged in the SOR, which triggers the application of AG \u00b6 \n28(d).  \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines also include examples of conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, as set forth in AG \u00b6 29. Those conditions include:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; and  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation. \n \nAll three doctors agree that Applicant staying on his medication is the key to his \nmental health stability. In January 2020, Dr. 1 indicated Applicant had been \npsychiatrically stable since 2014. In September, 2019, Dr. 2 stated that future psychotic \nepisodes can be mitigated provided Applicant remain on his medication. In October \n2020, Dr. 3 stated that Applicant has accepted that he must take his medication along \nwith other medication to ensure adequate functioning. Applicant credibly testified to his \nunderstanding of the need to take his medication and he has faithfully done so since \n2014. Dr. 3 opined that based upon Applicant\u2019s evaluation and the strong protective \nfactors existing in his life, namely his family support and his stability at work, combine to \nincrease his chances of a good prognosis. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(c) apply. \nAdditionally, even if I had determined that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and \n28(c) applied in this case, I conclude that they would also have been mitigated by AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(c). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s education, \nfamily status, and contractor service. I also considered his mental health history as \ndeveloped in the record, as well as the opinions and conclusions of Drs. 1, 2, and 3. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the psychological conditions security \nconcerns.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline I. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact 2 Applicant denied all the allegations (except \u00b6 1.c, which was neither admitted nor denied). After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working for his current employer in 2009. He is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and was commissioned a second lieutenant upon his graduation in 1982. He served in the U.S. Air Force on active duty for six years, in the U. S. Air Force Reserve (AFR) for six years, and in the Air National Guard for eight years. He retired after 20 years of honorable service in 2009 as a lieutenant colonel. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1989 and a law degree in 1991. He took out student loans while attending law school and still owes approximately $60,000 on those loans. He was in private law practice for approximately 18 years after law school. The last nine years of his practice he specialized in bankruptcy law. He has been an active member of a state bar association for over 30 years. He is twice divorced (most recently in 2018) and has one adult son who lives with him. (Tr. at 7, 21-23, 41-42, 44-45; GE 1-2) Under Guideline F, the SOR (and subsequent amendment) alleged that in 2008, Applicant had a state tax lien (state 1) filed against him in the amount of approximately $3,382; that Applicant failed to file state 1 tax returns for tax years 2008-2009; and that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state 2 tax ",

DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 9, 2020 (which contained attachments \nthat were considered as part of his answer), and he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nDecember 10, 2020, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on January 6, 2021. \nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s discovery letter sent to the Applicant and its exhibit \nlist were marked as hearing exhibits (HE I and II). Applicant testified, but he did not offer \nadditional exhibits aside from what he submitted earlier with his answer. The record was \nkept open until February 12, 2020, to allow him to submit any evidence related to the \namended allegation (see below), or for any other relevant purpose. He failed to submit \nany additional evidence by the established deadline (See HE III\u2014email string last dated \nFebruary 16, 2021) and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non January 15, 2020. \nProcedural Issue \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at hearing to add an additional \nallegation under Guideline F. Applicant objected to the amendment. The amendment\u2019s \nunderlying facts concerned Applicant\u2019s untimely filings of federal and state tax returns \nfor years 2010-2012 and 2019. The amended allegation was of a similar nature as the \ninformation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The evidence supporting the amended allegation \ncame from documents supplied by Applicant in response to interrogatories or from his \nhearing testimony. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and granted the motion to amend. I \nalso ordered the record to remain open for over five weeks (February 12, 2021) to allow \nApplicant to submit additional evidence to address the amended allegation. As noted \nabove, he did not provide any additional evidence before the deadline. The new SOR \nallegation is identified as \u00b6 1.c and reads as follows: \u201cYou failed to timely file your \nfederal and state 2 tax returns for tax years 2010-2012 and 2019.\u201d (Tr. at 104-109; GE 3 \nat pp 16-20) \nFindings of Fact \n2 \n \nApplicant denied all the allegations (except \u00b6 1.c, which was neither admitted nor \ndenied). After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nfor his current employer in 2009. He is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and \nwas commissioned a second lieutenant upon his graduation in 1982. He served in the \nU.S. Air Force on active duty for six years, in the U. S. Air Force Reserve (AFR) for six \nyears, and in the Air National Guard for eight years. He retired after 20 years of \nhonorable service in 2009 as a lieutenant colonel. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1989 \nand a law degree in 1991. He took out student loans while attending law school and still \nowes approximately $60,000 on those loans. He was in private law practice for \napproximately 18 years after law school. The last nine years of his practice he \nspecialized in bankruptcy law. He has been an active member of a state bar association \nfor over 30 years. He is twice divorced (most recently in 2018) and has one adult son \nwho lives with him. (Tr. at 7, 21-23, 41-42, 44-45; GE 1-2) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR (and subsequent amendment) alleged that in 2008, \nApplicant had a state tax lien (state 1) filed against him in the amount of approximately \n$3,382; that Applicant failed to file state 1 tax returns for tax years 2008-2009; and that \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state 2 tax returns for tax years 2010-2012 \nand 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). \nUnder Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose a \nfederal tax lien in the amount of $6,176, entered in May 2010, on his July 2016 security \nclearance application (SCA); that he deliberately failed to disclose that his wages had \nbeen garnished for a debt, or that he was over 120 days delinquent on any debt \npreviously listed, or that he is currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt on his July \n2016 SCA; and that he provided false or misleading information on his February 2008 \nSCA when he affirmatively responded that he had been over 180 days delinquent on \nany debts and that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt, and listed \nthose debts as student loans in the amount of $72,000. In July 2008, Applicant filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition listing unsecured non-priority claims of over $500,000, \nincluding medical, consumer, and non-educational debt of approximately $173,000, \nnone of which was earlier reported on his February 2008 SCA. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c). \nApplicant\u2019s current financial difficulties began in approximately 2008, although he \nhad received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 1997. In 2008, he was engaged in \nthe private practice of law in state 1. He also was earning income from his AFR position, \nwhich was subject to state 1 income tax. He decided to file for bankruptcy in 2008 \nbecause he wanted to dissolve his law practice, close his related credit-counseling \nbusiness, and his real-estate business. Applicant claimed these actions were necessary \nbecause of a dispute he had with his real-estate business partner. He claimed the \npartner was expending business funds for non-business purposes. When Applicant \nconfronted his partner about his actions and indicated he was going to report it to the \npolice, Applicant claims the partner threatened his and his family\u2019s lives. Rather than go \nto the police, Applicant decided to close up his businesses, file for bankruptcy \nprotection, and move to state 2. (Tr. at 24-26) \nApplicant claims that the 2008-2009 time frame was tumultuous for him because \nof closing down his businesses, going through bankruptcy, moving to state 2, and \nstarting a new job. He offers this as a partial explanation for his state and federal tax \nissues at the time. (Answer to SOR (Ans.)) \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s financial issues is as follows: \nState 1 Tax Lien Indebtedness, May 2008-$3,382. Documentation shows that \non May 14, 2008, a lien was filed in the amount of $3,382 by the Department of \nRevenue for state 1 against Applicant. The document also shows that the notice of lien \nwas addressed to Applicant\u2019s then-business address in state 1. Applicant claims he did \nnot receive this notice and it was not forwarded to state 2, where he relocated in June \n2009. He testified that he did not become aware of the lien until receiving interrogatories \nfrom the Government in August and November 2019. Despite being a bankruptcy \nattorney and running a credit-counseling business, he claims he did not run a credit \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreport to see if it listed any liens. After issuance of the SOR in January 2020, Applicant \ncontacted the tax authorities in state 1 and confirmed the lien and the underlying state \nincome tax debt. He documented a payment of $4,150 (including penalty) to state 1, but \nhe is unconvinced that he legally owed the state the money. (Tr. 30-33; GE 1, 3, 4, 8; \nAns.) \nUntimely Filings of Applicant\u2019s 2008 and 2009 state 1 tax returns. Applicant \ntestified that he simply forgot about his 2008 return because it was when he was closing \ndown his businesses and moving. He testified that he did not believe he had income \nfrom state 1 in 2009 and therefore he did not need to file a state return. He forgot about \nhis AFR income which derived from state 1 and was therefore taxable. In the earlier \ninterrogatories submitted to Applicant, he stated that he was convinced he had filed his \n2008 and 2009 state tax returns. However, he had not filed either return when they were \ndue. He presented documentation showing that both returns were not filed until \nFebruary 2020. (Tr. 33-35; GE 4; Ans.) \nUntimely Filings of Applicant\u2019s 2010-2012 and 2019 federal tax returns. Tax \naccount transcripts supplied by the Applicant in response to Government interrogatories \nreflect that for tax year 2010, Applicant failed to file his own tax return by the filing \ndeadline. This is established because the IRS filed a substitute tax return in May 2013. \nWhen asked about this at hearing, Applicant stated he could not really explain how this \nhappened. Additional tax account transcripts for tax years 2011 and 2012 show that \nboth years\u2019 returns were filed in April 2014, which was untimely for both years. Applicant \nadmitted in his testimony that these filed federal returns, as well as his state tax returns \nfor the same period, were untimely. Applicant was asked if he had other unfiled tax \nreturns. He admitted that his 2019 federal and state tax returns had yet to be filed. The \nIRS extended the filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, 2020, for tax year 2019 \nbecause of COVID-19. Any requested filing extensions until October 15, 2020, also had \nto be filed by July 15, 2020 (See https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus-tax-relief-\nfiling-and-payment-deadlines). Applicant explained that his father had passed away \nduring the past year and he was back in his home state for eight weeks settling his \nfather\u2019s affairs and he forgot to file his returns. He was going to get information to his \naccountant so he could get those returns filed quickly. He was given the opportunity to \nsupplement the record by showing when he actually filed his returns, but he failed to do \nso. (Tr. at 99-105; GE 3) \n \nApplicant stated that the reason he did not list the 2010 federal tax lien on his \n2016 SCA was because he was unaware of the lien at that time. A federal tax lien is \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s September 2016 credit report. In his 2008 SCA, Applicant listed a \nfederal tax lien from 2003. A review of his tax transcript for year 2016 shows that he \nreceived a $10,000 tax refund, which would have been captured by the IRS to pay any \nlien amount if it was still owed. These facts tend to corroborate Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat he was unaware of a federal tax lien when he completed his 2016 SCA. (Tr. at 36-\n37, 82, 86; GE 2, 3) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Section 26 of his July 2016 SCA, Applicant was asked inter alia, \u201cIn the past \nseven years, have you had your wages . . . garnished for any reason? In the past seven \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyears, have you been over 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously entered? \nYou are currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt?\u201d He responded by checking \nthe \u201cno\u201d option. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished beginning in August 2018, which was \nafter he completed his SCA. Therefore, the garnishment question above is not at issue. \nHowever, Applicant believed the garnishment was based upon his delinquent student \nloans. He explained that he held both government-guaranteed loans and privately-held \nloans totally approximately $75,000 for his law school education. He claimed that he \nhas paid the government-backed loans since 2009 (up until the COVID-19 deferment). \nHe further stated that he has not made payments on the private loans because the \nloans have been bought and sold by so many creditors he could not get any accounting \nof what he owed. He did not start paying on these private student loans until the \ngarnishment took place. He listed his student loans in his 2008 SCA. He believed \u201cno\u201d \nwas the correct answer to the 2016 SCA because he was paying his government-\nbacked student loans and the status of his private-based student loans was unknown by \nhim. (Tr. at 73-81; GE 2, 3, 5; Ans.) \nApplicant explained why, in response to Section 28 of his February 2008 SCA, \nhe listed delinquent debts of $72,000 consisting of student loans, but in July 2008, he \nreported over $500,000 in unsecured non-priority claims when he filed his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition. Applicant stated that because he practiced bankruptcy law, he \nknew the best practice was to list any possible liability in his petition to ensure that all \ndischargeable liabilities would be discharged. That meant listing debts that were not \ndelinquent at the time he filed his bankruptcy. An example of this was his listing of a \n$100,000 contingency debt to his former business partner who threatened to sue \nApplicant. No debt was owed, but he listed it in his petition to protect him from a future \nclaim by the partner. A completed breakdown of Applicant\u2019s debts listed in his \nbankruptcy as to the type of debt and when they were delinquent is listed in his SOR \nanswer. Additionally, Applicant did not run a credit report before completing his 2008 \nSCA, but he did run one before he completed his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 37-39, 65-72; \nGE 1, 2, 6; Ans.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had delinquent state tax debt which resulted in the filing of a lien \nagainst him in 2008. He failed to pay that debt until February 2020, after the issuance of \nthe SOR. He also failed to timely file his 2008-2009 state 1 tax returns, or his 2010-2012 \nfederal and state 2 tax returns. He also has failed to file his 2019 federal and state 2 tax \nreturns. I find the above disqualifying condition is raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nWhile going through a bankruptcy, quitting his law practice, moving to a different \nstate in 2009, and his father\u2019s death in 2020, may have been conditions beyond his \ncontrol, Applicant did not take responsible action to timely pay the 2008 state 1 tax debt. \nHe also failed to act responsibly by not timely filing his 2008-2009 state 1 tax returns or \nhis 2010-2012 federal and state 2 tax returns. There is no evidence to show that he has \never filed his 2019 federal or state 2 tax returns. His non-filing and delay in filing shows \na lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(g) partially \napply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe Government failed to establish that Applicant deliberately falsified or \nprovided misleading answers on his 2016 and 2008 SCAs. Applicant\u2019s assertion that he \nwas unaware of the 2010 federal tax lien when he completed his 2016 SCA is \ncorroborated by his past action in listing a tax lien in his 2008 SCA and by his tax \ntranscripts showing that he received a tax refund during 2016.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly asserted that he did not deliberately provide false or \nmisleading information concerning his student loans when completing his July 2016 \nSCA. He listed his student loans in his 2008 SCA. He had been paying his government-\ninsured student loans, but the status and ownership of his privately-held student loans \nwas unknown at the time he completed his SCA. Applicant\u2019s wage garnishment began \nafter he completed his July 2016 SCA. \nApplicant credibly asserted that he did not deliberately provide false or \nmisleading information on his February 2008 SCA. The reason why his July 2008 \nbankruptcy petition contained significantly more liabilities than he listed as delinquent \ndebts in his 2008 SCA was because his bankruptcy petition contained all his liabilities, \ncontingent and those not yet delinquent, whereas his SCA disclosed only his delinquent \ndebts at the time. Because no deliberate falsification was established, it is unnecessary \nto explore the applicability of any mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his legal education as it related to \nunderstanding his tax filing obligation, and how his father\u2019s death and settling his affairs \nimpacted the filing of his 2019 federal and state tax returns. His handling of his tax \nissues, particularly his non-filing of his 2019 federal and state tax returns, causes me to \nquestion his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. As noted above, the \npersonal conduct security concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 22, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 31, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 24, 2020. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 5, \n2020, scheduling the hearing for April 8, 2020.

Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nAA. There were no objections and the exhibits were admitted into evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on July 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He denied \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2011. He is married and has three children, ages 23, 22 and 17. He enlisted in \nthe Marines in 1992 and was accepted into a commissioning program and commissioned \nin 1997, serving as a helicopter pilot. He served in combat and has an 80% Veteran\u2019s \ndisability rating. He retired from the Marine Corps in 2014 and has worked for his present \nemployer, a federal contractor, since 2016. (Tr. 18-25, 124; GE 1, AE Y, Z) \nApplicant had three rental properties (A, B, C). All had been his primary residence \nat one point. He acquired them while on active duty and retained them as rentals after he \ntransferred duty stations. At the time, keeping the properties made sense because he \nwould not have made any money selling them. He was able to financially handle the \nproperties. (Tr. 25-31; AE D, E, F) \nApplicant began \u201cflipping\u201d houses in 2005 and successfully sold them and made a \nprofit three or four times. He used a real estate advisor to assist him in estimating how \nmuch it would cost to repair the house and then resell for property. He also used \nprofessionals to do the repair work. He formed an LLC company in 2018. (Tr. 26-29, 34\u00ad\n37, 104-105) \nApplicant testified that he regularly obtained cash advances from credit cards to \npurchase properties and fund repairs. He used the credit cards alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.d for these purposes. Other expenses were purchased with these cards also. He \nalso used a loan from his 401K pension plan. (Tr. 34-38) \nIn approximately 2017, Applicant realized he was overextended. He had \npurchased a property for a steep discount and anticipated selling it for a profit. He testified \nthat he now realizes the situation he created was foolish. The real estate market was \nsluggish and insurance companies were adding new requirements due to hurricanes in \nthe area. He was unable to sell his property at a profit and ended up selling at a loss.

Applicant \nfiled a police report. Numerous repairs were required on the property. Applicant used \ncredit cards to pay for them. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was used to pay for the \nrepairs. Some of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was also used. (Tr. 31-34; AE O) \nApplicant realized he needed financial help and was overwhelmed and intimidated \nto try and resolve the problems by himself. He decided not to file bankruptcy. He found a \ndebt assistance company (DAC) to help him. DAC\u2019s services included reaching out to \ncreditors on accounts that Applicant had registered with the service, negotiating an \nagreement, and making agreed-upon payments on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant was to \npay $1,382 a month into DAC\u2019s account. He was advised that his accounts had to be in \ndefault to negotiate with the creditor and was advised to stop paying the accounts. \nApplicant started working with DAC in October 2017 and signed up for their services in \nNovember 2017. One of his accounts did not qualify for this service. Applicant made \npayments from January 2018 until April 2019 ($19,215). He was regularly in contact with \nDAC to ensure each account was properly logged in and were being accepted. (Tr. 43-\n50, 105; AE G, H) \nApplicant testified that he was unaware that his accounts were not being \nnegotiated for payment through DAC until he was served with a lawsuit by the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a in the later part of 2018. DAC hired an attorney on Applicant\u2019s behalf for the \nlawsuit. Tr. 50-51; AE J \nApplicant testified that he lost faith in DAC when he was sued by the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a and was sued again by the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d. It is the same creditor, but \ndifferent accounts. The law firm that DAC had hired to defend the lawsuit in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nadvised Applicant that they were no longer taking cases from DAC. Applicant demanded \nanswers from DAC. They were uncooperative and according to Applicant did not act as \nthey had represented they would. It was Applicant who worked with the law firm to obtain \na settlement for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. and not DAC. Applicant demanded DAC reimburse \nthe amount he had paid them. Applicant contacted his state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office \nand was referred to the state\u2019s department of consumer affairs where he filed a complaint. \nDAC denied responsibility. Applicant researched and found lawsuits against DAC. One \nattorney representing a client in a similar lawsuit in another state indicated he did not \nbelieve DAC was solvent, so it was not worth filing suit against them. Applicant stopped \nmaking payments in April 2019, and sent DAC a termination letter in June 2019, accusing \nthem of fraud and disputing DAC\u2019s excuses and explanations. No payments were made \nby DAC to any of Applicant\u2019s creditors. Applicant testified that DAC could not show that it \nhad negotiated any settlements. He was not reimbursed any money. (Tr. 51-60, 101-103; \nAE H, I, J, R) \nApplicant researched potential financial specialists to help him resolve his debts. \nHe contacted four clients of Mr. M, who is a business consultant specializing in credit card \ndebt modification and credit repair. All references provided favorable endorsements. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant signed an agreement with Mr. M to negotiate settlements for his debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. (Tr. 60-63; AE M) \nIn December 2019, Applicant was able to negotiate a settlement for the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant paid the settlement and the debt was satisfied. (Tr. 63-64, 96-97; \nAE J, K, L) \nMr. M negotiated a settlement for debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in July 2020. Applicant will \npay $17,500 over 50 months with payments of $281, plus a balloon payment in \nSeptember 2024 of $3,447. He has automatic payments made from his account. He \nprovided documents to show the agreement and his consistent monthly payments from \nJuly 2020 through May 2021. (Tr. 64-66, 98; AE P, Q, R) \nApplicant disputed the account in SOR \u00b6 1.c as alleged because he did not have \nan account with that number. He indicated in his SOR answer that he had two accounts \nwith the creditor and one closely resembles the one alleged. In approximately August \n2019, he took action to resolve the accounts before receiving the SOR. He testified that \nthe accounts were paid and closed after he refinanced them. He provided documents to \nreflect this action. He also provided a copy of the new loan. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 67-\n73, 99; AE A, B). \nMr. M has contacted the law firms that are handling the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e. Mr. M stated in his affidavit that he has in good faith aggressively attempted to enter \ninto settlement agreements with both creditors, however communication during the \npandemic has been difficult. He left voicemails and return calls often would take 30 days. \nHe stated that the pandemic has caused delays in negotiating settlements on behalf of \nApplicant and all of his other clients. He was recently advised that the law firms are too \nbusy filing new lawsuits, and they do not have the staff to return phone calls, and that \ncommunications are being implemented to negotiate accounts through email. Mr. M \nstated he is personally handling the negotiations with both creditors. He continues to act \nto negotiate a resolution of these debts on Applicant\u2019s behalf. (Tr. 75-78; AE M, Q) \nApplicant testified that he tried to get a home equity loan to help resolve his debts, \nbut because of his financial situation he was unable to secure one. He does not have any \nother delinquent debts. Prior to 2017, his finances were in good order. He has participated \nin financial counseling and has learned about budgeting and debt management. He has \na written monthly budget. He has an emergency fund, so if something unexpected \nhappens, his financial situation is not made worse. In October 2019, he communicated \nwith his employer\u2019s facility security officer advising him of the financial issues he was \nhaving. Applicant is no longer in the real estate business. He does not intend to \u201cflip\u201d \nhouses in the future. He and his family are living within their means. (Tr. 78-93; AE N, S, \nU, V, W). \nApplicant testified that as a retired combat Marine, he knows the importance of \ntrust and maintaining a security clearance.

In them, he is described as honest, reliable, \ntrustworthy, forthright, and ethical. He abides by procedures and regulations and is a \nperson of sound judgment who can be trusted. (AE AA) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent credit card debts that began accumulating in 2017. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant experienced financial problems when he could not sell his rental \nproperties for a profit due to the downturn in the housing market and when a tenant failed \nto pay rent and caused damage to his property. These factors were beyond his control. \nHis use of credit cards to finance his real estate transactions and pay for repairs were \nwithin his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. When Applicant realized he was in financial trouble, \nhe sought assistance with DAC to help him manage and pay his debts. Unfortunately, \nthat did not happen, and he was essentially swindled out of approximately $19,000. He \nfiled a complaint with his state\u2019s consumer protection agency. He confronted DAC and \ndemanded to be reimbursed, to no avail. Despite this setback, Applicant worked with an \nattorney to settle and pay one of the credit card debts. He researched and contracted with \na reputable business consultant, Mr. M, to negotiate payment plans for his other debts. \nHe is in a payment plan to resolve one of the other credit cards. Mr. M stated that he is \nactively working to negotiate payment plans for the other credit card. The process has \nbeen slowed considerably due to the pandemic. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to \nconclude that the debt in SOR \u00b61.c was refinanced and is not delinquent. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and ongoing because not all of his debts are resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant is in a payment plan for one debt, and Mr. M is \nacting on his behalf to negotiate payment plans for his remaining debts. Applicant \nparticipated in financial counseling, he has a budget, an emergency fund, and a plan for \nresolving his remaining debts. There are clear indications his financial problems are being \nresolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant has made good-faith efforts \nto resolve his debts with his overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 49 years old and a retired Marine. His financial problems are attributed \nto a downturn in the real estate market and tenants who failed to pay rent. He openly \nadmitted that there is a level of risk involved in this business and using credit cards was \nunwise. Despite his due diligence, he became overextended. Applicant did not walk away \nfrom his financial responsibilities. Rather he sought assistance through DAC to help him \nmanage his debts. Unfortunately, he paid more than $19,000 to this company and none \nof his debts were resolved. Despite this setback, he responsibly sought assistance with \na reputable professional consultant. Applicant\u2019s financial history is not perfect, but there \nis considerable evidence that when he experienced financial difficulties, he did the \nresponsible thing. Of particular note is that Applicant was addressing these matters before \nhis public trust eligibility was raised, and he notified his employer that he was having \nfinancial problems. The public trust eligibility process is not meant to determine if a person \nis capable of making good business decisions. It is meant to determine when things go \nwrong, did you do the right thing. I believe Applicant did. I am confident that he will adhere \nto his payment plans and resolve his remaining debts. Applicant has met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Although he was repeatedly advised to submit answers to the Amended SOR using the words \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny,\u201d he failed to do so. Accordingly, his silence in this regard has resulted in denials to be reflected for all of the allegations in the Amended SOR. His comments with respect to both his admissions and his denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 68-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a data analyst/scientist with his current employer since 2018. He previously served as a self-employed (subcontractor) system engineer from 2003 until 2018.

In 1978, he returned to active duty as an officer, and he remained on active duty until he was honorably separated in 1994. He previously held a variety of security clearances, 2 including secret, and top-secret/sensitive compartmented information (SCI). He was married in 1973 and divorced in 1991; and remarried in 1991 and divorced in 2007. He remarried in 2012. Military Awards and Decorations During his military service, Applicant ",

Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on July 13, 2020. Because of protocols associated with the COVID-\n19 pandemic, no further action was taken to schedule a hearing until the following year. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 14, 2021. A Notice of Hearing by way of a Defense \nCollaboration Services (DCS) video teleconference was issued on May 5, 2021, \nscheduling the hearing for May 12, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4 and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through AE H were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on May 26, 2021. Department Counsel \nmoved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence presented during the hearing. The \namendment addressed changes to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., as well as the addition of \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. In the absence of any objection, the motion was granted. I kept the record \nopen until June 9, 2021, to enable Applicant to supplement it. He timely submitted a \nsubstantial number of documents, to which there were no objections, and I marked and \nadmitted them as AE I through AE X. In addition, Department Counsel submitted one \nadditional document, to which there was no objection, and I marked and admitted it as \nGE 5. Two Administrative Exhibits (ADME), including the Amended SOR, were also \nmarked and made part of the record as ADME I and II. The record closed on June 9, \n2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the SOR \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Although he was repeatedly advised to submit \nanswers to the Amended SOR using the words \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny,\u201d he failed to do so. \nAccordingly, his silence in this regard has resulted in denials to be reflected for all of the \nallegations in the Amended SOR. His comments with respect to both his admissions and \nhis denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 68-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a data analyst/scientist with his current employer since 2018. He previously served as \na self-employed (subcontractor) system engineer from 2003 until 2018.

He was \nmarried in 1973 and divorced in 1991; and remarried in 1991 and divorced in 2007. He \nremarried in 2012. \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his military service, Applicant was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Air Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal (with two clusters), the Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal, the Air Force Longevity Service Medal (with one device), the Air \nForce Overseas Service Long Tour Ribbon, the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Ribbon \n(with one device), the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon (with two clusters and \none V for valor), the Air Force Training Ribbon, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Ribbon \n(with two clusters and one V for valor). (AE H) \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86); GE 2 (enhanced subject interview, \ndated May 7, 2019); GE 3 (responses to interrogatories, containing various account \ntranscripts; state and federal income tax returns; and correspondence); GE 4 (responses \nto interrogatories, containing a personal financial statement and pay stubs); GE 5 (state \nliens); AE I \u2013T (Applicant\u2019s payments to U.S. Treasury 2007 \u2013 2018); and AE U (federal \nand state notices of levy). \nApplicant was not an effective or accurate historian of his financial facts as \nevidenced by his inconsistent recollections of when certain activities took place. He \nacknowledged that he was experiencing financial issues as far back as 2004 when a state \ntax lien was filed against him. He admitted that he failed to timely file his state and federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2016, and acknowledged that he failed \nto timely file his state and federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2011. He attributed \nhis financial problems to several factors: he experienced marital problems associated with \na separation and a contentious divorce; he was immature and procrastinated in filing and \npaying his taxes from 2012 until 2016; he did not obtain tax consulting help in 2007 or \n2008; he was negligent; and he chose to avoid addressing another unpleasant event, not \notherwise explained. (GE 2, at 4; Tr. at 29-31, 55) Substitute tax returns were prepared \nby the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in February 2015 for the 2012 federal return: in \nJuly 2016 for the 2013 return; in August 2017 for the 2014 return; and August 2017 for \nthe 2015 return. (GE 3, at 6-13, 119-120) \nHe obtained the professional services of a tax consulting service in 2018, and he \neventually filed the delinquent federal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through \n2016 in August 2019. (GE 3, at 14-25, 34-45, 57-68, 79-90, 101-110) He also eventually \nfiled the delinquent state income tax returns for those same tax years in August 2019. \n(GE 3, at 26-33, 46-56, 69-78, 91-100, 111-118) \nWith regard to the alleged untimely filings of the federal and state income tax \nreturns for 2006 through 2011, despite Applicant\u2019s acknowledgements during the hearing \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he had not timely filed those returns (Tr. at 30-32), the Government offered no \nevidence \u2013 either documentary or testimonial \u2013 other than those unsubstantiated \nacknowledgments, that those filings were untimely. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s failure to \nformally answer the allegations in the Amended SOR means that he essentially denied \nthe allegations. This is significant because facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence\u201d of the alleged facts \u2013 more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance. \nApplicant\u2019s denials and the absence of independent evidence supporting the allegations, \nwhen contrasted with his acknowledgments, do not support a finding of substantial \nevidence. In other words, Applicant\u2019s acknowledgments regarding the issues of the \nincome tax returns for 2006 through 2011 are unverified, and thus, unproven. Since the \nGovernment had the burden of producing evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR, in this instance, it failed to do so.  \nIn August 2010, the IRS issued a Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other \nIncome (Form 668-W9c) for the tax years 2004 through 2006, and as of September 16, \n2010, his interest and late payment penalty due was $250,574.93. In August 2011, the \nIRS issued a Notice of Levy (Form 668-A(ICS)) for the tax years 2004 through 2006, and \nas of August 31, 2011, his interest and late penalty due was $257,023.89. for the same \ntax years, and as of August 31, 2011, his interest and late payment penalty due was \n$231,890.97.

In September 2012, the IRS issued another Form 668-\nA(ICS) for the tax years 2005 through 2009, and as of October 12, 2012, his interest and \nlate penalty due was $345,270.95. In May 2013, the IRS issued another Form 668-A(ICS) \nfor the tax years 2006 through 2011, and as of June 14, 2013, his interest and late penalty \ndue was $375,422.24. In May 2015, the IRS issued another Form 668-A(ICS) for the tax \nyear 2010, and as of June 25, 2015, his interest and late penalty due was $47,329.65. In \nJune 2016, the IRS issued another Form 668-A(ICS) for that tax years 2006 through 2011, \nand as of July 20, 2016, his interest and late penalty due was $345,208.57.

(AE C) \nThe Executive Director of a mentoring program commented on Applicant\u2019s \nexemplary service over a several-year period, ending in 2004. (AE D) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe Amended SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2016. There is unverified information, \nunsupported by documentation, that the income tax returns for the tax years 2006 through \n2011 were not filed until 2019. With regard to the federal and state income tax returns for \nthe tax years 2012 through 2016, there is substantial evidence that they were not filed \nuntil August 2019. The Amended SOR also alleged that Applicant was delinquent in \npaying his federal income tax, amounting to approximately $698,000, including late \npayment penalty and interest and he was delinquent in paying his state income tax, \namounting to approximately $260,000, including late payment penalty and interest. There \nis no evidence that Applicant was unable to pay his federal and state income taxes or that \nhe refused to satisfy his delinquent income tax debts regardless of the ability to do so. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) have been established, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) have not been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but neither of the other mitigating conditions apply. As noted \nabove, Applicant attributed his financial problems to several factors: he experienced \nmarital problems associated with a separation and a contentious divorce; he was \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nimmature and procrastinated in filing and paying his taxes from 2012 until 2016; he did \nnot obtain tax consulting help in 2007 or 2008; he was negligent; and he chose to avoid \naddressing another unpleasant event, not otherwise explained. None of those factors \nappear to have been largely beyond his control. Substitute tax returns were prepared by \nthe IRS for the tax years 2012 through 2015. But no income tax returns were filed for \nthose tax years until much later. In August 2019, he filed his federal and state income tax \nreturns for the years 2012 through 2016. In October 2019, under an Installment \nAgreement, he agreed to start paying the IRS $1,153 per month by direct debit from his \nbank account. Also, in February 2021, under an Installment Agreement with the state \nFranchise Tax Board, he agreed to start paying the state $700 per month by direct debit \nfrom his bank account. He has been in compliance with those arrangements. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nAlthough he obtained the professional services of a tax consulting service in 2018, \nthere were still no income tax filings for his delinquent returns. In November 2018, he \nsubmitted his SF 86, the first step in his security clearance eligibility review. On August \n13, 2019, he responded to a set of interrogatories \u2013 one day after he filed several of his \nincome tax returns \u2013 and exactly one month after the initial set of interrogatories was \nissued. Each step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. With respect to his unfiled federal and \nstate income tax returns, there is no evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve \nany of those issues before the interrogatories were issued. By failing to do so, he did not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nA debt, including unpaid income taxes, that became delinquent several years ago \nis still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, \nand recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, and his failure to voluntarily \nand timely resolve his delinquent federal and state income tax accounts, make it rather \neasy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like \nit had been for several years. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. A reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide \nfor the payment of such debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time.

In this \ninstance, there was no actual resolution efforts over lengthy periods. Instead, the federal \nand state authorities had to file liens, levies, and withholding orders to gain his attention \nand obtain some of his delinquent income taxes. \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 68-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \ndata analyst/scientist with his current employer since 2018. He previously served as a \nself-employed (subcontractor) system engineer from 2003 until 2018. A 1971 high school \ngraduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1978. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in \n1971, and he served on active duty until he was honorably discharged in 1975. In 1978, \nhe returned to active duty as an officer, and he remained on active duty until he was \nhonorably separated in 1994. He previously held a variety of security clearances, \nincluding secret, and top-secret/SCI. In August 2019, he filed his federal and state income \ntax returns for the years 2012 through 2016. In October 2019, under an Installment \nAgreement, he agreed to start paying the IRS $1,153 per month by direct debit from his \nbank account. Also, in February 2021, under an Installment Agreement with the state \nFranchise Tax Board, he agreed to start paying the state $700 per month by direct debit \nfrom his bank account. He has been in compliance with those arrangements. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for the tax years 2012 through 2016, and they were not filed until August 2019. \nHe also failed to pay his federal and state income taxes for those tax years. Applicant \nwas delinquent in paying his federal income tax, amounting to approximately $698,000, \nincluding late payment penalty and interest and he was delinquent in paying his state \nincome tax, amounting to approximately $260,000, including late payment penalty and \ninterest. Because of a 10-year statute of limitations on collecting back taxes, the \nsettlement that his tax consulting service worked out with the IRS was purportedly limited \nto approximately $138,360. \nApplicant\u2019s track record is extremely poor at best. He acknowledged inaction in \ncontacting his two creditors \u2013 the IRS and the state Franchise Tax Board for several years \nafter he failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. He failed to file those \ndelinquent income tax returns until after he received interrogatories from the DOD CAF \nrelated to his income taxes. Liens and withholding orders were filed against him. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9) \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.

The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 22, 2019, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).

(Tr. at 24-27, 60.) \nFinancial Considerations  \nApplicant first experienced financial problems in 2016 or 2017 when the IRS \naudited his 2011 and 2012 income tax returns and determined that he owed $17,000 in \nunpaid taxes. Applicant paid the tax debt by borrowing the funds from a bank. He noted \nan error in the summary of his February 17, 2019 background interview (GE 2) that \nreported he said that this loan was used to pay for courses in stock-option trading. The \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports in the record reflect that this loan was opened in February \n2017.

His financial problems \nworsened in March 2018. Applicant purchased a Bitcoin option for $250 from a foreign \nonline trading operation that advertised on social media. Within a month, the online trader \nreported that the value of Applicant\u2019s investment had grown to almost $100,000. At one \npoint in his testimony, Applicant said that he invested additional money into his Bitcoin \naccount, which partially explained the astronomical growth of his modest initial \ninvestment. Applicant sought to withdraw his money and was advised that he needed to \npay $7,000 and subsequently, another $4,000 in \u201ctransaction taxes.\u201d He paid these \namounts, but stopped when more was demanded. He never received anything from this \ninvestment. He believes that he was the victim of a scam. (Tr. at 32-40, 53, 58, 64.) \nApplicant overdrew his line of credit with a credit union to make the two payments, \ntotaling $11,000. He testified that he panicked and sought the advice of a credit counselor, \nwhich was in fact a credit-consolidation company. The counselor recommended that he \nstrategically default on repaying the line of credit and all of his other debts even though \nhe could afford to pay these debts. The \u201cstrategy\u201d behind this advice was that the credit \ncounselor would use the defaults as leverage over the creditors to negotiate repayment \nterms for less than the amounts of the individual debts, thereby reducing his debts. \nApplicant was required to pay $689 per month to the debt-consolidation firm. Part of these \npayments were fees to the company and the balance was to be used to pay his debts \nover time. He followed this advice and stopped paying his debts in mid-2018. As it turned \nout, most of Applicant\u2019s payments was applied to the counselor\u2019s fees. None of the money \nwas paid to a creditor. Applicant recognizes now that his strategic default on his debts \nwas a mistake since he could have simply used this money to pay his debts. (Tr. at 32\u00ad\n40, 61-63.) \nIn January 2019, Applicant switched to a different financial counselor who only \ncharged him $89 per month. For these fees, this counselor has disputed Applicant\u2019s debts \nand in the future will negotiate with his creditors to seek a reduction in the amounts owed \nand payment plans to pay the debts over time. Applicant has not repaid any of his debts \nthrough this new counselor. More recently, he has been primarily focused on attempting \nto generate additional income through a side business venture to pay down his debts. (Tr. \nat 32-40.) \nThe Six Admitted Debts Listed in the SOR \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Bank Loan Charged Off in the Amount of $18,447. Applicant used the \nfunds from this loan to pay his tax debt for tax years 2011 and 2012. He defaulted on the \nloan in May 2018. The bank charged the debt off in the amount of $17,607 in October \n2018. After the hearing, Applicant developed a plan with the advice of his second credit \ncounselor to resolve his debts (the Plan). He submitted the Plan with his other post-\nhearing evidentiary submissions. With respect to this debt, he writes in the Plan that he \nwill pursue a pending lawsuit in which he contests the validity of this debt under the \nFederal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). He provided no evidence showing \nthe legal basis for this claim. He submitted a discovery request and an email from a lawyer \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregarding a dispute with a collection agency and two lenders unrelated to the creditor \nidentified in this SOR allegation. The claim made in the documents may be asserted under \nthe FDCPA, but the documents do not specifically refer to the FDCPA. The exhibits do \nnot show that this evidence related to the bank loan referenced in SOR \u00b6 1.a or what the \nbasis of the claim was with respect to this specific debt. Also, Applicant did not testify \nabout a legal claim he was pursuing in defense of this creditor\u2019s debt or that there was a \npending lawsuit regarding this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28, 65; AE D, E, \nH.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, Credit Union Line of Credit Charged Off in the Amount of $17,870. \nApplicant opened this checking account line of credit in July 2017 with a limit of $15,000. \nHe overdrew the line of credit when he paid \u201ctransaction taxes\u201d to the Bitcoin trader. He \ndefaulted on this debt in October 2018. The credit union charged off the debt in the \namount of $17,865. Under Applicant\u2019s November 2, 2020 Plan, he will repay one debt at \na time starting with the smallest debts first. At a future date, he hopes that his counselor \ncan negotiate a payment plan to repay this debt in the amount of $7,146. Applicant \nprovided no basis to support this figure in his Plan as a realistic and possible settlement. \nNo payments have been made as of the close of the record because Applicant lacks the \nnecessary funds. The timing of the commencement of any future payments is unknown \nat this time. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 42-43; GE 3 at 4; GE 6 at 5; AE E.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, Credit Union Credit-Card Account Charged Off in the Amount of $8,205. \nApplicant opened this credit-card account in July 2017. He last paid on this account in \nMay 2018. The credit union charged off the debt in the amount of $8,205. Under the Plan, \nApplicant began paying this debt with a $100 payment on November 3, 2020, to the \ncreditor\u2019s collection agency. He is scheduled to continue paying $100 per month for the \nnext five months. In his Plan, Applicant claims that the creditor will or has accepted a \nrepayment of this debt in the total amount of $3,282. The figure of $3,282 is the amount \nof a settlement offer set forth in a letter from the credit union dated May 12, 2020, for a \none-time, immediate payment. Alternatively, the credit union offered to accept \u201cminimum \npayments of $82 a month until the entire balance is repaid.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \nApplicant offered no evidence that the credit union has accepted monthly payments of \n$100 on the reduced amount of $3,282. After the hearing, Applicant has made one \npayment of $100. This debt is not resolved.

Applicant does not list this debt in his Plan. Instead, he provided \na legal pleading, dated July 29, 2020, in which his defense attorney \u201crequested\u201d the \ndismissal of the lawsuit \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d Neither the pleading nor Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission explains the basis for this request.

He defaulted in February 2019. The creditor charged the \naccount off in the amount of $5,184 and transferred it to a collection agency. The most \nrecent credit report in the record reflects a debt of $5,178. Applicant\u2019s Plan comments \nthat this debt, as with the one listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e, will be the subject of future negotiations \nof a payment plan. The collection agency has recently made a settlement offer to \nApplicant. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 51-52; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE \n6 at 2, AE E.) \nApplicant testified that he opened several of the listed credit-card accounts in July \n2017. He used the credit to pay for courses in various entrepreneurial areas that he hoped \nto pursue to increase his income above the $77,000 annual income he earns working for \nhis clearance sponsor. He explained that he \u201chad shiny object syndrome\u201d at that time. He \nacknowledged that he \u201coverleveraged\u201d his credit cards while attempting to find a business \nventure that would quickly make him rich. He spent a substantial portion of his new credit-\ncard debt of about $25,000 on these courses in 2017 and 2018. He figured he would pay \noff this new debt with the profits from his new business venture. He described the courses \nas \u201cmentorships\u201d in which he learned marketing, sales, and professional communication. \nHe claims that he learned valuable new skills that he is using now in his real estate \nbrokering business. (Tr. at 47-51, 55.) \nThe subjects of the courses varied from online retail sales to life insurance sales \nto wholesale real estate brokering. He is currently pursuing a second career in the \nwholesale real estate business and has earned his first fee \u201cflipping\u201d contracts to \npurchase homes and reselling the contracts to other buyers. He earned $2,500 on this \ntransaction, which he hopes to duplicate with more and larger transactions. Applicant took \na mentorship course in May 2019 to learn about this business opportunity. He pays an \nassistant $60 per week to identify potential real estate purchases. His business model \ndepends on two prerequisites, one, finding properties that are not listed for sale and can \nbe bought cheaply, and two being able to resell the purchase contracts to a third party at \na profit so he does not have to purchase and own the property or default on the \ntransaction. He did not explain this plan in detail, but he may pre-sell the sales contract \nto a buyer before he contracts to purchase a home to reduce the risk. Applicant testified \nthat he expects to make significant additional income with this business that he can use \nto pay his debts more quickly in the future. Like all of his other businesses, starting with \nthe Bitcoin investment, they appear to be \u201cget rich quick\u201d schemes that may or may not \nactually produce any significant income. Applicant testified that he does not gamble. His \nbusiness activities have produced little income to date.

She describes Applicant as \u201can honest, reliable hardworking Christian that \nvalues integrity and humanity,\u201d as well as a person of good character, integrity, and a \n\u201cgood heart.\u201d (AE C.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(e): (\u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or \nirresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsignificant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, \nor other negative financial indicators. \nApplicant has had significant financial issues since 2017. He made a serious \nmistake taking the risk of a strategic default hoping to reduce his debts or at least \npostpone the payment of his debts. His speculative spending on mentorship programs he \ncould not afford was irresponsible. These facts are sufficient to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Five of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are current, \nfrequent and cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) is not established.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe conditions that resulted in Applicant\u2019s financial problems were solely of his \nown making. He overdrew with credit line to make payments in an attempt to collect his \nvery dubious Bitcoin profits before he figured out that he had been defrauded. To the \nextent that Applicant\u2019s Bitcoin scam losses are analogous to \u201cclear victimization by \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npredatory lending practices or identity theft,\u201d Applicant did not acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He paid the fraudulent charges with borrowings that exceeded that \namount of his credit line and subsequently decided to default on his credit-line debt even \nthough he could have continued to pay it. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \nApplicant took the advice of a financial \u201ccounselor\u201d to \u201cstrategically default\u201d on his \ndebts in the hopes of negotiating repayments of reduced amounts at a later date. There \nis no evidence in the record that the counselor was a \u201clegitimate and credible source, \nsuch as a non-profit credit counseling service.\u201d The strategy called for the counselor to \nprofit off of the large monthly fees paid to it by Applicant before any debts were repaid. \nApplicant eventually realized this was a bad strategy and cancelled his contract with the \ncounseling company. He then began working with a second counseling firm that charged \n$100 per month. This arrangement had the result that Applicant would again not be able \nto make any significant payments on his large debts. Also, there is no evidence that this \ncurrent financial counselor is a legitimate and credible source. Moreover, there are no \nclear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial indebtedness is being resolved. His speculative \nbusiness venture in real estate is not a reliable source of funds that will permit him to \nrepay his creditors reliably in the future pursuant to payment plans to be negotiated. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) is not established. \nApplicant has not initiated and is not adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors. His Plan was not submitted until after the hearing, and he has only made one \npayment of $100 to one creditor under the terms of the Plan. All of the debts in the SOR \nare unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \nAlthough Applicant admitted all of the debts in his Answer, he now claims in his \nPlan that he is disputing a lawsuit on one SOR debt and makes no reference in the Plan \nto a debt that is the subject of a second lawsuit. He has provided no evidence that he has \na reasonable basis to dispute either debt and has not documented the basis of his \ndisputes. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \nIn light of the record as a whole, Applicant failed to carry his burden to establish \nmitigation of the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Paragraph 1 is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the applicable \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis indebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

She no longer owes for 2015. In May 2021, \nwith penalties and interest, the balance owed the IRS for 2016 was $4,708. She \nestimated her total federal tax liability to be about $12,000. (Tr. at 18-23; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A-D) \nApplicant accepted responsibility for her tax failures. All tax returns except for \n2016 have been filed on time. She is current on her state taxes. She credibly stated that \nall future tax returns will be filed on time, and she will continue with her IRS installment \nplan until all of her back taxes are paid. (Tr. at 18-23) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file her 2016 federal and state income tax returns when they \nwere due. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \n3 \n\n \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file her tax returns when required raises questions about her \njudgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. Nonetheless, I am satisfied \nthat Applicant has learned a valuable lesson, and that all future returns will be filed on \ntime. She filed her 2016 federal and state income tax returns; all other returns have \nbeen filed on time; her state taxes are paid; and she has been in an installment plan \nwith the IRS for more than a year. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(g) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

On September 18, 2020, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for October 13, 2020. \nOn September 23, 2020, I issued a Case Management Order to the parties by e\u00ad\nmail. It largely concerned procedural matters relating to the health and safety of the \nhearing participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including pre-hearing submission \nand exchange of proposed exhibits. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled.

Her admissions and statements are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. She has two adult daughters, who live with her. Both \nare gainfully employed. Applicant and her husband are legally separated as of \nDecember 2014. (Tr. 114-116; AE E) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017, and \na master\u2019s degree in 2019. (Tr. 43-44, 114; GE 1; AE I) \nApplicant has worked as a federal contractor since 1993, though with certain \nperiods of unemployment between contracts. She worked with the Department of \nJustice for about 10 years, until 2003. She was a contractor with the Department of \nHomeland Security for 12 years, from September 2003 to September 2015. She earned \na salary of about $100,000 in that job. She was laid off when her employer lost its \ncontract. (Tr. 15-16, 42-46, 56-57, 123; Answer; AE A-AE D; GE 1, GE 12) \nApplicant was unemployed until December 2015. She then worked as a \ncontractor for the Department of the Navy, at a much lower salary ($36,000) until \nDecember 2016. After another layoff, she was then unemployed until February 2017. \nSince then, she has worked as a State Department contractor. Her current salary is \n$70,000. She has had a clearance for over 20 years, and is seeking to retain it. \n(Answer; Tr. 15-16, 45-48, 57-59, 62; GE 1) \nOn her most recent SCA, Applicant disclosed bankruptcy petitions that she filed \nin 2011 and 2018. (GE 1 at 35-36) She noted that most of her debts were student loans \nrelated to her daughters\u2019 college expenses.

(GE 3, GE 4, GE 6) (A 2018 \nbankruptcy petition, filed under Chapter 13 and later dismissed, was not alleged). \nApplicant attributed the 1996 bankruptcy to youth and inexperience. She said she \npurchased a car she could not afford and got \u201cway over my head\u201d financially. (Tr. 48, \n65) The Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed in September 1996 and was discharged in \nDecember 1996. (GE 6)(SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant matured and later married, but her marriage was troubled and abusive. \nHer husband was an authorized user of many of their accounts, and she was not aware \nof their financial issues as she should have been. Her husband assumed responsibility \nfor their mortgage, and she did not learn of their financial troubles until the home was \nnearing foreclosure. This led to the second bankruptcy. Her financial stability improved \nafter that, through her gainful employment as a government contractor. She also \nfurthered her education and provided financial support so her daughters could do the \nsame. (Answer) \nApplicant testified that her husband had been on workers\u2019 compensation after an \naccident at work as a city bus driver in about 1999, and he retired from the transit \nauthority in 2006. The loss of his full second income contributed to the family\u2019s financial \nwoes, as did their eventual marital separation. Applicant was also paying the living \nexpenses and college expenses of their two daughters. She testified that the passing of \nboth her parents also contributed to her financial instability. (Answer; Tr. 48-50, 55 GE \n7, GE 8, GE 12 at 26-28; GE 13) \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2011 after seeking advice on how to \nsave her home from foreclosure. In that bankruptcy petition, she disclosed several \nhundred thousand dollars of debts, including almost $600,000 in mortgages and over \n$150,000 in student loans. The bankruptcy was discharged in August 2011. (Answer; \nGE 7, GE 8) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems continued. She attributed her more recent issues \nto her 2015 job loss and subsequent loss of income. In late 2016, Applicant retained a \ndebt-relief company to assist in regaining financial stability. (AE F) She paid them over \n$1,000 a month in fees for several months, and over $8,000 total, but this did little good. \nShe no longer retains them. (Answer; AE F-AE H; Tr. 43, 111, 117-119) She also \nparticipated in credit counseling during her bankruptcies. (Tr. 113, 119-120) She keeps \na written budget and has learned to stay within it. (Tr. 64, 138-139) \nIn September 2018, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, but that \nbankruptcy petition was later dismissed. (Tr. 53-54, 83-89; GE 9) In May 2019, \nApplicant refiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. (Tr. 91-99; GE 10, GE 11) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nShe reported about $488,000 in liabilities. Of those, over $384,000 were student loans. \nShe also disclosed numerous consumer debts. (GE 11 at 9-10, 21-35) \nIn her most recent bankruptcy. Applicant reported limited available assets in \nchecking and savings accounts.

(GE 11 at 39-40) Her listed monthly \nexpenses totaled over $5,300, a monthly deficit of over $1,200. (GE 11 at 41-42) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent bankruptcy was discharged in August 2019. (GE 10) \nApplicant has a history of purchasing expensive cars. In 2007, she purchased a \nluxury vehicle for about $60,000. The car was in an accident in 2011. At the time, she \nowed about $15,000 in car payments that she could not afford. (Tr. 69-71; GE 13 at 3) \nIn 2013, after her second bankruptcy discharge, Applicant purchased a used \nluxury vehicle for about $41,000. The car was voluntarily repossessed in 2015 after she \nlost her job. She owed about $19,000 in payments at the time. (Tr. 81- 83; GE 2 at 6, \nGE 4 at 7) In 2016 she replaced it with another used high-end vehicle costing about \n$30,000. In 2019, before filing her most recent bankruptcy, she purchased another high-\nend automobile for about $30,000. She has a $767 monthly car payment. (Tr. 61, 101\u00ad\n103; GE 3 at 3) \nApplicant also has several hundred thousand dollars in outstanding student \nloans. (GE 3 at 2) She estimated that about half of the student-loan amount was for her \nown education, and half was for her daughters\u2019 education. Applicant knows that student \nloan debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. She testified that repayment of those \nloans is currently deferred by the creditors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. \n104-108, 124-125) \nApplicant believes that many of her financial issues occurred due to \ncircumstances beyond her control, such as her difficult marriage, her job layoffs, and \nher drop in income. She wants to improve her credit and does not want to repeat her \npast financial mistakes. She is now more conscious of her budget and her spending. \n(Answer; Tr. 21-22, 138-139) \nAccording to her work evaluations, Applicant exceeds job requirements in all \nrespects. She has effective work relationships and makes positive contributions. She \n\u201cgoes out of her way to offer assistance and support to her co-workers.\u201d She \ndemonstrates tact and consideration, and has a positive outlook and a pleasant \nmanner. (AE L; AE M) She has received certificates of appreciation for her work at the \nState Department. (AE K) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of delinquent debt and financial instability. She has \nfiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 three times, in 1996, 2011, and 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy three \ntimes between 1996 and 2019, and her Chapter 13 petition, filed in 2018 (not alleged) \nwas dismissed. Her financial issues are not isolated. They are also recent, as her most \nrecent bankruptcy was filed only last year. While all three bankruptcies in the SOR were \ndischarged, she has not established enough of a track record of financial stability to \nshow that her financial issues are unlikely to recur and no longer cast doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. Applicant\u2019s long career as a federal contractor \nhas been interrupted at times by layoffs, when her employer lost the contracts that \nemployed her. She also had a difficult marriage. These conditions were largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control, and they impacted her finances. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies. \nFor full effect, however, Applicant must also show that she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that. \nHer pursuit of higher education and providing the financial means for her two daughters \nare admirable, but she has long had several hundred thousand dollars in unresolved \nstudent loan debt that she has never put forth a serious effort to pay. She knows these \ndebts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, yet she provides no evidence of responsible \naction to resolve them. She also has a history of buying expensive cars that she cannot \nafford. The financial data she provided with her most recent bankruptcy petition shows \nthat she remains underwater financially, despite renewed gainful employment. Applicant \nhas not acted reasonably under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant hired a debt relief company, participated in credit counseling in \nconnection with filing bankruptcy, and testified to her renewed understanding of the \nneed to keep to a budget. But even though the 2019 bankruptcy was discharged, she \nhas yet to establish that her financial situation is truly resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is not fully established. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], \nan applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at \nresolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she \nrelied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim \nthe benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99\u00ad\n9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge afforded her a fresh start, but this is \nno substitute for a track record of steady payments and financial stability. This is \nparticularly so since she has discharged her debts in this fashion on multiple occasions, \nyet has taken few steps towards paying her other obligations responsibly or in \nestablishing financial stability. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2021. On March \n12, 2021, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for April 6, 2021. \nOn March 15, 2021, I issued a case management order to the parties by e-mail. \nIt concerned procedural matters relating to the health and safety of the hearing \nparticipants due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the pre-hearing exchange and \nsubmission of proposed exhibits. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1-11. GE 1-3, and GE 5-9 were admitted without objection. (Tr. 26) GE 4 \n(Tr. 19-26) and GE 10 (Tr. 18-19) were admitted over objections. The objection to \nadmission of GE 11 was sustained. (Tr. 18) Applicant testified and offered five exhibits, \nwhich were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 E and admitted without objection. \n(Tr. 27-28) DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 16, 2021. \nI held the record open after the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. He submitted AE F (April 14, 2021 letter from the defense attorney in \nApplicant\u2019s most recent case regarding probation status); AE G (April 9, 2021 e-mail \nfrom Applicant to state probation officer regarding probation status); and AE H (April 9, \n2021 statement of intent from Applicant); all of which were admitted without objection. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) II) The record closed on April 22, 2021. \nAmendments to the SOR \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend certain \nallegations in the SOR to conform them to the record evidence. A courtesy copy of the \nSOR, with likely amendments, was provided prior to the hearing, and is placed in the \nrecord, along with my related e-mail in response, as HE I. (Tr. 10) The amendments are \naddressed as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b concerns Applicant\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) in \nApril 2010. The second sentence (emphasis added) originally read: \u201cYou were \nconvicted in August 2010 and received probation before judgment.\u201d The proposed \namendment would have changed the wording to: \u201cYou plead[ed] guilty in August 2010 \nand received probation before judgment.\u201d This motion was denied, as the amendment is \nnot clearly established by the record evidence, since Applicant testified that he pleaded \n\u201cno contest\u201d to the charge (though GE 5 suggests a guilty plea) (GE 5; Tr. 46, 86, 112-\n113) The fact of the offense itself is not in dispute, so the specific circumstances of the \ndisposition are of little import.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c concerns Applicant\u2019s DUI arrest in July 2012, by U.S. military police. \nApplicant testified; however, that the arrest did not occur \u201con post\u201d as alleged (and as \nreflected in the police report, since he was outside the gates of the base when he was \nstopped. (GE 6) The phrase \u201con post\u201d was deleted from the text of SOR \u00b6 1.d, without \nobjection.

(Tr. 114-115; GE 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f concerns certain findings from a September 2019 psychological \nevaluation, GE 4. The SOR amendment changed one word in the second sentence of \nSOR \u00b6 1.f (from \u201cis moderate\u201d to \u201cseems moderate\u201d) to reflect the correct wording in GE \n4. It also changed one word in the third sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.f (from \u201csuggests\u201d to \n\u201csuggest,\u201d) to correct a grammatical error. These amendments were accepted without \nobjection. (Tr. 115-117) \nFindings of Fact \nIn answering the original SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. He \npartially admitted and partially denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nHis answers to each allegation included explanations. He did not address the cross-\nallegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, but I incorporate his admissions, denials, and explanations to \nthe underlying allegations in SOR \u00b6 1, accordingly. Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He and his wife married in March 2019. They have no \nchildren. (Tr. 32, 37) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. After a brief period of self-\nemployment in 2003, he worked from September 2003 to September 2004 as a civilian \nengineer (GS-5) for a Navy command in a state far from his home. From September \n2004 to January 2013, he worked for a DOD agency, starting as an intern and rising to \nGS-14. Applicant then worked for a defense contractor until November 2015, when he \nwas laid off. He was then unemployed until March 2016. He has worked for various \nemployers in the defense industry since March 2016, and has worked for his current \nemployer since 2018. (Tr. 30-33, 81-84; GE 1 at 11-14; GE 2 at 20-23) He has held a \nsecurity clearance since about 2004. (GE 1 at 37-40; Tr. 9, 36) He most recently \nsubmitted SCAs in October 2009 and December 2016. (GE 2, GE 1) He has an annual \nsalary of $195,000. (Tr. 83) \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant drove to a town in a neighboring state for a car \nshow. Before returning home that night, he stopped at a restaurant for dinner and \ndrinks. He fell asleep at the wheel while driving home and drove into a ditch. Police \ncame to the scene and he was arrested for DUI. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He spent the night in jail \nand returned home the next morning (Tr. 37-38, 42, 84-85) Applicant testified that he \ndid not recall how much he had to drink that evening because it was so long ago. (Tr. \n39) Records referenced in his September 2019 psychological evaluation indicate that \n\u201che had four to five beers and then drove home\u201d from the car show. (GE 4 at 3) \nApplicant later went to court, and was offered a plea agreement under which he \nwas to complete an alcohol education course, pay a fine, and serve a year of probation, \nafter which the case would be dismissed. Applicant completed the alcohol education \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncourse near his home, completed probation successfully and the case was closed.

(Tr. 40-41; GE 2 at 45) \nIn April 2010, Applicant was pulled over for speeding on his way home from \ndinner at a restaurant. He was arrested and charged with DUI after a field sobriety test. \n(Tr. 70-71)(SOR \u00b6 1.b) He testified that he pleaded no contest, and he received \nprobation before judgment (PBJ), served one year of probation, and had to attend a six-\nweek alcohol education course. (Tr. 45, 86) The Government\u2019s evidence reflected that \nhe pleaded guilty, rather than no contest, though Applicant \u201cdistinctly\u201d recalled it was the \nlatter. (GE 5; Tr. 46, 86) Applicant believed his probation ended without incident, but \nwas not specifically aware of how the case ended. He reported the offense to his DOD \nemployer. (Tr. 46-47, 86, 88-89; GE 3) \nIn July 2012, Applicant was driving home, past 11:00 p.m., after having dinner at \na restaurant. While driving home, he noticed a car tailing him and following his \nmovements. He pulled over when he saw emergency lights in his rearview mirror. He \nrefused a field sobriety test and was taken into custody. The police report reflects that \nthe officer detected \u201ca strong odor of alcohol emitting from [Applicant\u2019s] person.\u201d He also \nwas lethargic and showed signs of slurred speech. He took a breathalyzer test at the \npolice station, and registered a 0.13 blood alcohol content. (GE 7 at 5) He was arrested \nand charged with DUI, and some traffic offenses.

(Tr. 87; GE 6) Given the\nlocation of the incident, Applicant appeared in federal court, where he pleaded guilty to\na lesser charge of reckless driving and fined about $500.

(AE F, AE G) \nDuring the course of his 2019 security clearance investigation, Applicant was \nordered by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) to participate in a \npsychological evaluation, in September 2019. (GE 4; Tr. 67) He was evaluated by a \nlicensed clinical psychologist, Dr. B, who was asked to evaluate whether Applicant has \n\u201cany medical, psychological, psychiatric, emotional, or substance abuse conditions \nwhich could impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness[.]\u201d (GE 4 at 1) \nDr. B diagnosed Applicant with moderate alcohol use disorder. (GE 4 at 7) In \ndetailing the basis for her opinion, she noted that: \n[Applicant] has a significant history of alcohol use, beginning in 2003, and \nhe received 5 DUIs between 2007 and 2018. After each incident, he was \nrequired to complete alcohol abuse classes, however, he has never \nenrolled in an intensive substance abuse treatment program. Despite his \nnotable history of criminal conduct with alcohol, he has continued to drink. \nHe does attend weekly AA meetings, yet he admitted that he still has not \naccepted his alcoholism. (GE 4 at 1) \nThis was based upon Dr. B\u2019s review of Applicant\u2019s personal and social \ninformation, educational information, medical information, substance abuse history, \nlegal and mental health information provided by the DOD CAF, as well as her clinical \nobservations, a clinical interview, and his psychological test results.

As such, his \ndiagnosis could pose a risk to his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness \nconcerning classified information. (GE 4 at 7) \nApplicant denied being terminated from employment due to alcohol issues or \npoor performance. (Tr. 33-37) In Dr. B\u2019s report, she referenced employment records \nindicating that Applicant\u2019s termination in 2015 was due to such issues, but she also \nnoted that Applicant denied this in interviews with her, as he did at hearing. (GE 4 at 2) \nThere is no corroborating documentation from the employer in the record on this issue, \nand it is not alleged that Applicant ever had employment issues related to alcohol, so I \nwill not make such a conclusion. \nDr. B also noted Applicant\u2019s historical drinking pattern. She found that between \n2003 and 2010, he went on \u201c\u2018drinking binges\u2019 on a monthly basis, where he would drink \n\u201cintermittently\u201d throughout the weekend. From 2010 to 2015, he drank mostly on \nweekends often consuming 6-7 beers a night. Dr. B found that Applicant\u2019s drinking had \ntapered off significantly after he met his wife (in 2016), as he consumed one to two \ndrinks on weekends. From October 2018 to January 2019, he abstained from alcohol, \nbut then resumed drinking again. (GE 2 at 3)  \nIn March 2021, Applicant participated in another psychological evaluation, at the \nsuggestion of his attorney, in preparation for this hearing. He was evaluated by a \nlicensed doctor of clinical psychology (Psy.D), Dr. W. (AE C, AE D; Tr. 67)) \nDr. W\u2019s basis for her opinion was a review of background information, including \nDr. B\u2019s evaluation, review of Applicant\u2019s personal and social information, educational \ninformation, medical and mental health information, substance use history, and legal \ninformation, including court records from his arrests from 2010-2018,as well as her \nclinical observations, a clinical interview, and his psychological test results. (AE C) \nDr. W agreed with Dr. B\u2019s findings in her 2019 evaluation. (AE C at 6) Dr. W \nnoted that Applicant had significantly reduced his use of alcohol since 2019, and no \nlonger engaged in binge drinking. (AE C at 7) She found that he continued to meet the \ncriteria for moderate alcohol use disorder, though now in sustained remission. Dr. W\u2019s \nprognosis for Applicant is guarded. (AE C at 7-8; Tr. 79) \nDr. W\u2019s report notes that Applicant consumed six or more beers at his bachelor \nparty, in February 2019, about a month after pleading guilty in his most recent alcohol \ncase. (Tr. 94-95; AE C at 3) He was on probation at the time but was not prohibited from \nconsuming alcohol. (Tr. 96-97)    \nDuring his hearing, Applicant described his current alcohol usage as \u201cpretty low.\u201d \nHe said he drinks at home with family members or close friends, about once or twice a \nmonth.

(Tr. 63, 101-102) Applicant acknowledged that alcohol has disrupted his \nlife. He wants his wife and family to see him as a role model. Applicant also \nacknowledged health issues that he wants to improve. He knows that \u201calcohol has been \na problem for me in the past, and I don\u2019t want it to control my life.\u201d (Tr. 64) \nApplicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) between October 2018 and \nMarch 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led him to end social gatherings. (GE 4 at \n3; AE C at 3) He was not aware that he could have attended online AA meetings rather \nthan in-person meetings.

He vowed never to drink and drive. (Tr. \n65-66, 68-69, 97-98) \n \nApplicant asserted several times during the hearing that he had been using \nalcohol as a \u201csocial lubricant\u201d but no longer feels the need to do so now that he has met \nhis wife, since they do many things together that do not involve alcohol.

(AE B) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker) of \nalcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has five arrests for alcohol-related offenses between September 2007 \nand October 2018, a period of 11 years. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nApplicant has a long history of problematic alcohol involvement. His alcohol-\nrelated offenses are examples of conduct stemming from Applicant\u2019s impaired \njudgment. Dr. B specifically found that Applicant went on drinking binges on a monthly \nbasis between 2003 and 2010. Dr. W noted that Applicant had significantly reduced his \nuse of alcohol since 2019, and no longer engages in binge drinking.

AG \u00b6 22(d) might also apply to Dr. W\u2019s March 2021 \ndiagnosis of moderate alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission, but that more \nrecent diagnosis was not alleged, as it post-dates the SOR. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nApplicant has a long and troubled history of alcohol involvement. His drinking has \nled to five alcohol-related arrests in 11 years. He has been arrested about every three \nyears, most recently in October 2018 \u2013 less than three years ago. Applicant attested \nthat his 2015 DUI arrest was a \u201cwakeup call\u201d that led him to decrease his alcohol intake. \nYet he incurred a DWIA in October 2018. He attests that this most recent offense was \nan \u201coutlier.\u201d The record does not support this assessment, as it seems more to continue \nhis pattern of alcohol-related arrests. It may be that Applicant\u2019s marriage, and his wife\u2019s \nunderstandably livid reaction to his conduct will serve as a real \u201cwakeup call.\u201d But the \nfact remains that Applicant\u2019s history and pattern of DUIs is too established, and his \nlatest offense is too recent to mitigate. He did not establish that his offenses occurred \nunder unusual circumstances, that his alcohol-related misconduct is unlikely to recur, or \nthat it no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant gets some credit under AG \u00b6 22(b) for his decreased alcohol intake in \nrecent years. He no longer engages in binge drinking, and he and his wife engage in \nactivities together that do not involve alcohol. His diagnosis of moderate alcohol use \ndisorder is now in sustained remission, according to Dr. W. However, both Dr. B and Dr. \nW found that, given his alcohol history and his behavior, Applicant\u2019s prognosis remains \nguarded. As of the close of the record, Applicant has a good family support network, but \nhe has not resumed participation in AA, nor has he fully dedicated himself to its \nprinciples. Admittedly, in-person AA participation has likely been difficult, if not \nimpossible, in the ongoing pandemic environment, but Applicant does not have a \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsponsor whom he might rely on to work around this obstacle. Moreover, he has had \nmultiple opportunities to benefit from alcohol education (as part of most of his sentences \nafter his DUIs), but to little effect. With Applicant\u2019s history and pattern of DUIs as a \nbackdrop, AG \u00b6 22(b) is not fully applicable, as he has not demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has engaged in, and completed alcohol-education classes after most of \nhis arrests, and has some prior participation in AA, but he but he has not participated in, \nor completed, a treatment program, along with required aftercare program. He is not \ncurrently in treatment or counseling for his alcohol issues. AG \u00b6 22(d) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant has five arrests between 2007 and 2018, all for alcohol-related \noffenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited\nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term alcohol issues have led to five arrests between September \n2007 and October 2018. His alcohol issues and criminal conduct are significantly \nintertwined. His criminal conduct is repeated, of a similar nature, and is recent. His prior \nactions continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nHe has an excellent work record. He has a good family support network. But more time \nwithout any alcohol-related misconduct is needed to establish that his pattern of alcohol-\nrelated driving offenses will not recur. He has not established that either mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) or 32(d) should apply. For the same reasons as set forth above \nunder Guideline G, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the criminal \nconduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses are simply too numerous, too similar, and too \nrecent to warrant a finding that they are mitigated. All of his arrests have come about \nthree years apart. His most recent arrest was less than three years ago. He attests that \nhe has changed and credits his marriage with changing his lifestyle. This may be the \ncase, but this is undercut by the timing of his most recent arrest. The risk of recurrence \nis too great at this time for him to overcome. He needs to establish a significant, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nsustained track record of abstinence or sobriety, supported by appropriate counseling or \ntreatment, and a favorable prognosis, as well as a track record of compliance with the \nlaw before he can be considered a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation.

(Tr. 61, 70) \nAlcohol Consumption \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant frequently and habitually consumed alcohol in \nexcess and to the point of intoxication from about December 2007 to at least January \n2019. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that a licensed psychologist \u201cdiagnosed [Applicant] with alcohol \nabuse, uncomplicated (rule out alcohol dependence) and opined that [his] prognosis from \nalcohol abuse is only fair, given that [his] motivation to reduce [his] use to a healthier level \nis low.\u201d The psychologist acknowledged that Applicant had not had any legal trouble from \nalcohol consumption; however, his \u201cregular periods of intoxication could negatively impact \n[his] judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in the context of safeguarding sensitive \ninformation and working in a cleared environment.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn November 27, 2017, an Office of Personnel Investigations (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant. (GE 2) In 2011, Applicant drank two bottles of beer, and then he \ndrove. (Id. at 9) He drank to the point of intoxication once or twice a week from December \n2014 to November 2017. (Id. at 8) He told the OPM investigator that he was essentially \ndrunk for the year of 2014. (Id.) Occasionally he drank to intoxication three times in a \nweek, and once he drank to intoxication on five consecutive nights. (Id. at 8-9) He \nconsumed alcohol because of stress and anxiety. (Id.) Much of his stress was related to \nbecoming engaged to be married, and his family life in the first two or three years of his \nmarriage. (Id.) \nThe SOR does not allege sexual behavior or criminal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to consideration of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior while under \nthe influence of alcohol. I overruled the objection, and will only consider the evidence for \nthe limited purpose of mitigation in connection with alcohol-related judgment issues. In \n2013 when he was 21 years old, Applicant engaged in sexual intercourse on one occasion \nwith his 17-year-old cousin and on another occasion with his cousin\u2019s 17-year old friend. \n(Tr. 72-73; GE 2 at 9-10; GE 5 at 4, 6) The sexual contact with each of them was \nconsensual. (Tr. 72-73)  \nUnder the state law where the conduct occurred, a person who engages in \nintercourse or a sexual act with a child age 14 or 15 when the defendant is over the age \nof 21, or who engages in sexual contact (genital touching short of penetration) with a child \nunder the age of 14 when the defendant is at least four years older than the child commits \na crime. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s sexual acts with the 17-year-old girls were not criminal \noffenses. Applicant\u2019s cousin\u2019s friend sent Applicant partially nude photographs of herself \non Snapchat (showing her breasts and buttocks), and he retained them on his phone for \na time, and then he deleted them. (Tr. 73; GE 2 at 9; GE 4) He did not state he was \nintoxicated at the time he possessed the sexual images of a child (person under 18 years \nof age). Possession of sexual images of a child on a cell phone violates federal law and \nis serious criminal conduct.

(Tr. 16-20; GE 5 at 1) A licensed clinical social \nworker participated in Applicant\u2019s interview with the CAF psychologist. (Tr. 22-23) \nApplicant consumed alcohol in high school and college at times to excess. (Tr. 62-63, GE \n5 at 2) The only time he drove with alcohol in his system occurred when he was in high \nschool. At that time, he drank two drinks and then drove to a restaurant. (Tr. 70-71) He \nwas worried that the police would arrest him for underage alcohol consumption, but he \nwas not arrested. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption in college was limited. (Tr. \n62-63) His alcohol use increased in 2014. (GE 5 at 2) Applicant told the CAF psychologist, \n\u201cI spent most of [2014] drunk.\u201d (Id.) Applicant said this comment to the CAF psychologist \nwas an exaggeration because he never consumed alcohol during the day. (Tr. 74-75) He \nconsumed eight or more drinks while playing video games at night. (GE 5 at 2) He \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequires about eight drinks to become intoxicated. (Tr. 31) When he had to work the next \nday, he limited his alcohol consumption to four or five drinks. (GE 5 at 2) After he married \nin 2015, he reduced his level of alcohol consumption. (Id.) In January 2019, when the \nCAF psychologist evaluated him, his level of alcohol consumption for a typical week was \nabout 18 to 24 standard drinks of about 1.5 ounces per drink of whiskey. (Tr. 75; GE 5 at \n2) He drank more on weekends and less during the week. (Tr. 75; GE 5 at 2) He described \nhimself to the CAF psychologist as a \u201chighly functioning alcoholic.\u201d (Id.) He enjoyed \nalcohol consumption, but believed he could stop drinking if he had a good reason to do \nso. (Id.) His alcohol consumption did not adversely affect his marriage or employment. \n(Id.)  \n\u201cThe National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines normal drinking \nfor men as four or fewer drinks per day and 14 or fewer drinks per week. Consuming more \nalcohol than this categorizes a person as an at-risk drinker.\u201d (Id. at 6) According to the \nCAF psychologist\u2019s January 2019 report, Applicant\u2019s \u201cprognosis for recovery from alcohol \nabuse is only fair particularly given his motivation to reduce his use to a healthier level is \nlow.\u201d (Id.) Because of his alcohol use, particularly his periods of intoxication, his alcohol \nconsumption \u201ccould negatively impact his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness in the \ncontext of safeguarding sensitive information and working in a cleared settling.\u201d (Id. at 7) \nThe CAF psychologist diagnosed Applicant in January 2019, as \u201cAlcohol abuse, \nuncomplicated (Rule out Alcohol Dependence),\u201d which he based on International \nClassification of Disease (ICD) code F10.10. The World Health Organization uses ICD \nF10.10 for diagnosing alcohol use. (Tr. 32; GE 5) ICD F10.10 does not have diagnostic \ncriteria but is loosely associated with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) 4, \npublished by the American Psychiatric Association, which includes the term \u201cAlcohol \nDependence.\u201d (Tr. 32-33, 47) DSM 5 was issued in 2013, and the term Alcohol \nDependence was changed to Alcohol Use Disorder. (Tr. 33)  ICD 11 is expected to be \nreleased in 2021, and it may incorporate the term alcohol use disorder from DSM 5. (Tr. \n33) The CAF psychologist did not limit himself to the diagnostic criteria in DSM 5, and \ninstead, he used his own background and experience to make his diagnostic assessment \nof Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. (Tr. 33-36, 38) He believed Applicant was an open, \ncandid person. (Tr. 39) If Applicant received alcohol-related therapy, and he stopped \ndrinking alcohol for six months, the CAF psychologist would conclude that Applicant was \nnot a risk to security. (Tr. 38-39) \nIn 2020, a forensic, clinical psychologist evaluated Applicant (Applicant\u2019s \npsychologist). (Tr. 42) He concluded Applicant\u2019s alcohol use was at a normal level at its \nhighest point \u201cand not worthy of any kind of concern or diagnosis.\u201d (Tr. 46, 57) At its \nheight, Applicant drank about a fifth to a fifth and a half \u201cover the course of a week with \npretty much daily drinking in the evening starting at 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d (Tr. 52) Applicant never \ndrove a car after drinking (except the one occasion when he was in high school). (Tr. 52) \nApplicant had increased tolerance due to his regular alcohol consumption, and therefore \nhis judgment was not as significantly affected by his alcohol consumption as it would have \nbeen without the increased tolerance for alcohol. (AE A at 7) Applicant did not suffer \nwithdrawal from ending his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 55-56) He noted Applicant is \u201cnow \ncompletely sober and participating\u201d in AA meetings. (Tr. 46) He has sustained sobriety \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand his prognosis is excellent. (Tr. 46-47) The DSM 5 was issued to reduce subjectivity \nin diagnosis. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist believed the CAF psychologist\u2019s evaluation was incorrect \nbecause it did not rely on DSM 5 criteria, and Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption did not \nhave a negative impact on his marriage, social life, and employment, and there were no \narrests. (Tr. 49-50) Applicant\u2019s attendance at AA, does not mean Applicant is an \n\u201calcoholic\u201d or suffers from alcohol abuse disorder. (Tr. 50) AA defines \u201can alcoholic\u201d as \n\u201canyone for whom alcohol has been a problem. So it\u2019s a subjective, self-identification. \n. . . And everybody who attends AA calls themselves an alcoholic.\u201d (Tr. 50-51) The \n\u201calcoholic\u201d term in AA has no medical standing. (Tr. 51) Applicant\u2019s psychologist \nconcluded, \u201cto a great degree of psychological certainty, [he] found [Applicant] to suffer \nfrom no psychological or other mental health limitation that would adversely affect his \nability to hold a security clearance.\u201d (AE A at 8) \nA licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed substance abuse professional \n(SAP), and certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), provided an assessment and \nalcohol-related counseling to Applicant at six sessions beginning in April 2020. (AE C; AE \nD) The LCSW described Applicant as \u201ccandid and forthright\u201d and indicated that he \n\u201cexhibited excellent insight into his situation, expressed sincere remorse, and has actively \nengaged in rectifying his past behavior.\u201d (AE C at 2) Applicant continued his AA \nattendance via Zoom meetings in 2020. (Id. at 3) Applicant \u201cdid not experience cravings, \ntolerance, withdrawals, blackouts or hangovers.\u201d (Id. at 4) Applicant \u201cpassed one of the \ncritical thresholds of sobriety, namely the first six months.\u201d (Id.) This six-month time period \nis important because withdrawal symptoms are more in\n tense. (Id.) Based on DSM 5, the \nLCSW diagnosed Applicant with \u201cNo Use Disorder\u201d and she recommended no treatment. \n(Id.) She recommended approval of his access to classified information. (Id. at 5) \nOver the last several years, Applicant decreased his alcohol consumption as his \nfamily responsibilities increased. (Tr. 63) In July 2017, when his spouse was expecting \ntheir first child, he planned to end his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 79) However, he did not \nend his alcohol consumption until April 21, 2020, even though he was attending AA \nmeetings in 2018 and 2019. (Tr. 63, 79) Applicant\u2019s alcohol use did not cause any \nproblems with the police, courts, or his employment (aside from the security clearance \nissue). (Tr. 64) From April to June 2020, he attended alcohol-related counseling, and his \ncounseling reinforced his decision not to consume alcohol. (Tr. 69) Applicant is happy \nwith his decision to end his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 65) In 2020, he lost 45 pounds and \nis now down to 185 pounds. (Tr. 65) His high-blood pressure has decreased to normal. \n(Tr. 76) Applicant has more energy, and his circle of friends has increased. (Tr. 66) He \nbelieved that ending his alcohol consumption would be better for his career and alleviate \nsecurity concerns. (Tr. 66). He has attended AA since 2018, and he increased his \nattendance at AA meetings to at least once a week in December 2019. (Tr. 67, 78-79). \nWhen he attended AA meetings, he limited his alcohol consumption to about \u201ca half a pint \nor so.\u201d (Tr. 79) Applicant believes that he profits from AA attendance. (Tr. 67) He has \ncommitted himself to not drinking alcohol in the future. (Tr. 68) His support groups are his \nfamily, AA, and his church. (Tr. 68) He brought his AA sobriety chips to his hearing. (Tr. \n80) Applicant concluded his hearing statement indicating: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI think I\u2019ve been very truthful through this whole entire process. And when I \nsay I have no intentions to ever drink again, I mean it absolutely. It\u2019s not \nworth it to me. If it\u2019s going to risk my career and being able to provide for \nmy family in any way, then I\u2019m done with it. And I think I\u2019ve thoroughly \nenjoyed the past seven months of being completely sober and abstaining \nthat I have every intent to stay that way. (Tr. 81) \nCharacter Evidence \nThree friends who attend the same church with Applicant as well as his spouse \nprovided character statements supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. (AE F) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is \ndiligent, knowledgeable, intelligent, honest, and dependable. (Id.) His wife said he \nreduced his alcohol consumption in 2018, and completely ended his alcohol consumption \non April 21, 2020. (Id.) The termination of his alcohol use improved his health, energy \nlevel, and demeanor. (Id.) Applicant has received a bonus and achievement award from \nhis employer. (Tr. 60)  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c) and 22(d) apply. Applicant admitted that he drank to intoxication on \nmultiple occasions. The CAF psychologist diagnosed him with \u201cAlcohol abuse, \nuncomplicated (Rule out Alcohol Dependence),\u201d which is akin to an \u201calcohol abuse \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisorder\u201d in AG \u00b6 22(d). \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol \nuse in the United States.\u201d See the Center for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe \nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of \ndrinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent \nor above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women \nconsume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.\u201d), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact\u00ad\nsheets/binge-drinking.htm. There are other definitions of \u201cbinge alcohol consumption\u201d that \ninvolve different alcohol-consumption amounts and patterns. He engaged in binge-\nalcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. \nThe Diagnostic Criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) at 490 states: \nA. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant \nimpairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, \noccurring within a 12-month period: \n1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was \nintended. \n2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control \nalcohol use. \n3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use \nalcohol, or recover from its effects. \n4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol. \n5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations \nat work, school, or home. \n6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or \ninterpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. \n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or \nreduced because of alcohol use. \n8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. \n9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or \nrecurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been \ncaused or exacerbated by alcohol. \n10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: \na. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve \nintoxication or desired effect. \nb. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same \namount of alcohol. \n11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: \na. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria \nA and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal, pp. 499-500). \nb. Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) \nis taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. \nSpecify if: In early remission: After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were \npreviously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that \nCriterion A4, \u201cCraving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol,\u201d may be \nmet).

Nevertheless, the DOD CAF \npsychologist\u2019s opinion is important because AG \u00b6 22(d) is not explicitly restricted to DSM \n5 criteria. Applicant\u2019s psychologist and LCSW concluded Applicant did not meet the \ncriteria for alcohol abuse disorder; however, those evaluations were based on evaluations \nin 2020 after Applicant had stopped consuming alcohol. \nIn July 2017, when Applicant\u2019s spouse was expecting their first child, Applicant \nsaid he planned to end his alcohol consumption. His consumption of alcohol for a longer \nperiod than intended satisfied DSM 5 criteria symptom one. His increased tolerance of \nalcohol satisfies DSM 5 criteria symptom 10b. There is sufficient evidence to meet the \nDSM 5\u2019s standard for Alcohol Abuse Disorder 305.00 (F10.10) Mild in 2017 because he \nhad two symptoms in a 12-month period. The CAF psychologist, Applicant\u2019s psychologist, \nand Applicant\u2019s LCSW all agreed that six months of abstinence after alcohol-related \ntherapy would indicate \u201calcohol abuse\u201d under DSM 5 was not an appropriate diagnosis. \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. Incidents of driving under the influence of alcohol are particularly \nproblematic because they show a serious lack of judgment and risk injury or death to the \napplicant and the public. In this case, there were no alcohol-related driving incidents. \nNevertheless, a person who drinks to intoxication, and scrupulously avoids driving \nafterwards may exercise questionable judgment or fail to control impulses in other areas \nsuch as in a security context. See AG \u00b6 21. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial alcohol abuse \nthat AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly lengthy period \nof abstaining from alcohol consumption or responsible alcohol consumption. See ISCR \nCase No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). See \nalso ISCR Case No. 08-04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial of security \nclearance for Applicant with alcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior to \nhearing). For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the \nAppeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat \nApplicant continued to drink even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the \nJudge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance where most recent alcohol-related incident was three years \nbefore hearing because of overall history of alcohol consumption). \nIn ISCR Case No. 18-02526 (App. Bd.

Sept. 20, 2019) (reversing grant \nof security clearance for applicant with three alcohol-related driving incidents with most \nrecent occurring in 2017)). \nIn this case, two psychologists, a LCSW, and DSM 5 cited the importance of \ntherapy plus at least six months of abstinence to the alcohol-rehabilitation process. For \nsecurity purposes there is no bright-line abstinence test that automatically mitigates \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G.  \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. Applicant significantly \nreduced his alcohol consumption in 2019, and completely stopped his alcohol \nconsumption on April 21, 2020. His alcohol consumption \u201cdoes not cast doubt on [his] \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a) partially applies. \nThere is evidence of four non-SOR allegations: (1) Applicant drove after drinking \ntwo beers or drinks in high school (underage alcohol consumption-possible driving while \nimpaired by alcohol); (2)-(3) Applicant engaged in sexual intercourse with two 17-year-\nold girls in 2013; and (4) Applicant possessed child pornography (pictures of one of the \n17-year-old girl\u2019s breasts and buttocks) in 2013.

The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nThe sine qua non component of alcohol-related security concerns is alcohol\u2019s \nimpact on judgment as reflected in AG \u00b6 21 and AG \u00b6 23(a). These four instances of poor \njudgment Applicant showed when he was impaired or intoxicated by excessive alcohol \nconsumption or when his overall judgment was affected by multiple alcohol binging \ninstances are relevant in the mitigation analysis. However, the most recent incident of \nsuch poor judgment was seven years ago, and Applicant has changed his patterns of \nalcohol consumption.  \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that his excessive alcohol consumption had adverse effects on \nhis health and employment (because his access to classified information has not been \ngranted). He provided evidence of his actions to reduce his alcohol consumption from \n2019 to April 20, 2020, and to abstain from alcohol consumption after April 21, 2020. AG \n\u00b6 22(b) applies. \nApplicant received some alcohol-related therapy from the LCSW and attended \nnumerous AA meetings. He has AA chips showing his satisfactory progress in sobriety. \nHe \u201chas no previous history of treatment and relapse.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c) applies. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) applies. Applicant completed the alcohol-related therapy or counseling \nthe LCSW provided. There was no recommended aftercare. Applicant\u2019s reduced alcohol \nconsumption from 2019 to April 21, 2020, shows \u201ca clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption.\u201d The absence of any alcohol consumption after April 21, 2020, \nadds to the mitigating effect of AG \u00b6 23(d). \nEnough time has elapsed since 2019 to enable a reasonable predictive judgment \nthat his maladaptive use of alcohol is safely in the past. He intends to continue to refrain \nfrom alcohol consumption. He receives support in his continued abstinence from AA, his \nchurch, and his family. Alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline G are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old embedded electrical and software engineer who has \nworked for a defense contractor since April 2016. In 2015, he graduated from college \nSumma Cum Laude with a 4.0 grade point average, and he received a bachelor\u2019s degree \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin electrical engineering. At his hearing he said that in December 2020, he expects to \nreceive a master\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering from an elite university.  \nThree friends who attend the same church with Applicant as well as his spouse \nprovided character statements supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is diligent, \nknowledgeable, intelligent, honest, and dependable. The termination of his alcohol use \nimproved his health, energy level, and demeanor. Applicant has received a bonus and \nachievement award from his employer.  \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption especially in 2013 and 2014 raised \nserious security concerns. In 2013, he showed extremely poor judgment when he \nengaged in consensual sexual relations on two occasions with 17-year-old girls while he \nwas under the influence of alcohol, and he possessed child pornography (semi-nude \npictures of one of the girls). In 2014, he frequently became intoxicated in the evenings. In \n2019, he reduced his alcohol consumption; however, in January 2019, he was consuming \n24 drinks a week, and occasionally becoming intoxicated. Twenty-four drinks a week and \noccasional intoxication is excessive alcohol consumption for security purposes. In 2019, \nhe and his spouse had their second child, and he reduced his alcohol consumption to \nresponsible levels. On April 21, 2020, he ended his alcohol consumption. He received \nalcohol-related therapy, and he completed the alcohol-counseling program. He frequently \nattended AA meetings and earned sobriety chips. He intends to continue to maintain \nsobriety. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated \nalcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information.

Referral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of the \nCOVID pandemic. On February 17, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the \nGovernment was ready to proceed to a hearing. On March 8, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case assignment and file on March 12, 2021. On March 15, \n2021, I informed Applicant about an online video hearing, which she accepted. Following \na successful test of the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) platform on April 21, 2021, \non April 23, 2021, I scheduled Applicant\u2019s DCS video teleconference hearing for May 12, \n2021. \nAt the hearing, six Government exhibits (GEs 1-6) and nine Applicant exhibits (AEs \nA-I) were admitted without objection. A letter forwarding the proposed Government \nexhibits to Applicant was accepted as a hearing exhibit (HE 1). Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on May 25, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 12, 2019, Applicant \nowed $96,827 in federal student-loan debt in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.g-1.h, and 1.j); \n$19,074 in other loan or credit-card debt in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m-1.n, 1.q-\n1.s, and 1.u-1.v) or charged off (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f, 1.l, and 1.o-1.p); and a $381 utility debt \nin collection (SOR \u00b6 1.t). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she admitted \nall of the debts. She also indicated that she was following a monthly payment plan to \naddress her student loans, making payments on a $1,253 credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.u), \nand seeking financial counseling to resolve her other consumer-credit obligations. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is a 58-year-old high school graduate who completed some classes at a \ntechnical institute in 2011 and has been studying on and off at a community college since \nJanuary 2012, taking mostly online classes. She has yet to earn a degree. (GE 4; Tr. 36.) \nShe and her spouse have been married since May 1989. They have a 31-year-old son \nand a 32-year-old daughter.

Her spouse worked \nin construction until the economic downturn of 2008-2009. (Tr. 30, 34.) He collected \nunemployment for about 60 weeks. (Tr. 34.)

Paying rent, utilities, and other living expenses took \npriority over paying their credit-card bills. (Tr. 30.) \nIn approximately January 2011, Applicant\u2019s spouse began operating his own home \nimprovement business. Applicant stopped working as a school bus driver to become his \nfull-time office manager. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31.) Her spouse\u2019s work was sporadic, and his \nbusiness brought into their household less than $500 a week. (Tr. 35.) They continued to \nlive from paycheck to paycheck until late 2014 or early 2015, when her spouse took an \nopportunity at construction work in the Caribbean. (Tr. 35.) With an increase in his income \nfrom that work, their finances improved somewhat. She testified that she went on an \nincome-based repayment plan for her student loans at that time. (Tr. 60.) \nAfter a hurricane destroyed his business in the Caribbean in September 2017, \nApplicant\u2019 spouse moved back to the United States. He has been unemployed since then. \n(Tr. 30-32, 51.) Applicant testified that he has dealt with untreated post-traumatic stress \nbecause of living through the hurricane. (Tr. 51.) \nApplicant earned no income as her spouse\u2019s office manager from January 2011 to \nSeptember 2017. (Tr. 38.) After he lost his business, she was unemployed until December \n2017, when she took a seasonal job as a tax preparer at $10 an hour. (GE 1; Tr. 39, 60.) \nAfter the tax rush ended in May 2018, she was unemployed until February 2019, when \nshe began working for her current employer, a defense contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 41.) \nIn November 2018, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor to learn the \nstructural draftsman trade. She had not yet started working for the company when, on \nNovember 27, 2018, she completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF \n86). In response to a financial record inquiry on the SF 86 concerning any delinquency \ninvolving enforcement, Applicant listed three credit-card judgment debts for $2,513, \n$2,735, and $1,362, which she claimed were resolved in 2017 by monthly payments, and \na $1,207 credit-card judgment from January 2017 that she was repaying under a payment \narrangement. She cited unemployment as the reason for the credit-card delinquencies. \n(GE 1.) \nAvailable credit information shows that $2,513 was charged off in August 2013 on \na retail charge card obtained in June 2009. Last activity on the account was in March \n2013. It was assigned for collection in April 2017. While she indicated on her SF 86 that \nthe debt was paid off in approximately December 2017, a letter from the collection entity \nshows that she paid $888 on July 20, 2020, which settled the debt.

(AEs A, G-I; \nTr. 43.) She has made no payments on the student loan since then. (Tr. 43.) Available \ncredit reports show that she has not been required to make any payments on the federal \nstudent loans since April 2020. (AEs G-I.) \nOn January 16, 2019, Applicant had a telephone interview with an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about her financial \ndelinquencies. Applicant volunteered information about some outstanding delinquent \naccounts (her student loans and the credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.p, and 1.o) \nthat she had mistakenly not listed on her SF 86. She was confronted about the other past-\ndue debts on her credit record and recognized some of them (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.n, 1.q-\n1.r, and 1.u-1.v), although she believed that some of them were duplicate listings of those \naccounts reported on her SF 86. Applicant cited unemployment and the downturn in the \neconomy from 2008 to 2009 as the causes of her financial difficulties and stated that she \nplanned to repay her debts once she started working full time. (GE 4.) \nAfter the interview, Applicant looked into her credit-card accounts and provided an \nupdate to the investigator on January 22, 2019. She reported that she had paid two \njudgment debts, which available credit information shows had been placed for collection \nfor $1,084 (account ending x3206) and $388 (account ending x8476). She indicated that \nshe was making payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l (balance $929), 1.k (balance \n$1,112), and 1.u (balance $1,253). Applicant had also been able to confirm her liability \nfor the nine debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, 1.q-1.t, and 1.v. She admitted she had \nmade no payments on those debts, but she planned to start making payments once she \nhad a steady salary. (GE 4.) Applicant started her employment with the defense \ncontractor in February 2019 at $15.93 an hour. (Tr. 41, 57.) She also worked for the tax \nservice during tax season at $12 an hour. (Tr. 60.) \nExcept for the judgment debts, Applicant has not received any collection notices \nfrom her creditors in a couple of years. (Tr. 57.) In January 2020, Applicant opened a \ncredit-card account with a $1,000 limit and charged $471. She missed one payment due \nin December 2020 but caught up of the account in January 2021. As of April 2021, the \naccount was current with a balance of $318. Applicant has two other active credit-card \naccounts with balances of $1,268 and $852. She has made monthly payments on the \naccounts since opening them in June 2017 and June 2018, respectively. (AEs G-I.) \nIn August 2020, Applicant was approved for an income-based repayment of her \neligible student loans. The loan servicer required her to make no payments. (AE B.) As \nof May 2021, the total balance of Applicant\u2019s outstanding student-loan debt on loans \nobtained for her education and her son\u2019s education totaled about $210,959. (AE A.) Due \nto the pandemic, Applicant is not required to make payments on her federal student loans \nuntil September 2021. At that time, Applicant intends to apply for another income-based \nrepayment plan and then start paying what is required under that plan.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nShe does not presently intend to pay anything toward her student loans if she is not \nrequired to do so unless she comes \u201cinto some money.\u201d (Tr. 44.) \nApplicant has received increases in her hourly wage since February 2019. Since \nFebruary 2021, her hourly wage has been $21. (Tr. 57.) After deductions, including for \ntaxes, her take-home pay is between $500 and $550 a week. (Tr. 31-32.) As of May 2021, \nApplicant had not managed to set aside any money to repay her student loans. After \npaying their monthly living expenses, including rent of $600 a month, she has little \ndiscretionary income, if any. (Tr. 42, 57-58.) She testified that her spouse has a couple of \nweek-to-week job opportunities that \u201ccould be starting up mid to late summer.\u201d (Tr. 51.) \nHer son, who works for the same defense contractor, will contribute financially to the \nhousehold if she \u201creally need[s] something badly.\u201d He owns his home. (Tr. 58.) \nApplicant consulted with an attorney who advised her to file for bankruptcy, but \nshe was concerned about the impact of a bankruptcy filing on her employment with a \ndefense contractor.

(Tr. 44-45.) \nPolicies \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.

Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. \n11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant defaulted on some student loans, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseveral credit-card accounts, and a utility bill. Her credit reports from December 2018 and \nMay 2019 establish a prima facie case of significant delinquency. Disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. \n \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the \npotentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The following may apply in whole or in \npart: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAvailable credit information for Applicant shows that the credit-card debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e (same debt as \u00b6 1.d), 1.f, 1.i, and 1.k-1.s were charged off or placed for collection \nmore than five years ago. Even so, AG \u00b6 20(a), which provides for mitigation of debts that \nhappened \u201cso long ago,\u201d cannot reasonably apply. Only the credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.k and 1.u have been resolved, and only after the creditors filed for judgments against \nher. The $381 utility debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.t) remains unaddressed. An applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and are considered \nrecent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability because her financial problems started due to \nthe economic downturn during the 2008-2009 time frame. Her spouse, who worked in \nconstruction, collected unemployment for about 60 months while she was working part \ntime as a school bus driver. After his unemployment benefit ran out, he was unable to find \nwork that would pay him a wage to maintain their household expenses. It led him to start \nhis own business in January 2011. Applicant stopped working as a school bus driver and \nbecame his office manager at no pay. Their finances improved while he was living in the \nCaribbean for work from 2015 to 2017, but the September 2017 hurricane that \u201cwiped him \nout\u201d was an unforeseen circumstance that continues to adversely impact their household \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinances in that Applicant\u2019s spouse has not worked since then. She testified that he suffers \nfrom PTSD, which has prevented him from considering employment until recently. \nEven when the financial distress is caused or contributed to by circumstances \nbeyond one\u2019s control, the administrative judge has to consider whether the applicant has \nacted reasonably. In that regard, Applicant is credited with obtaining stable, full-time \nemployment with a defense contractor. She started working in February 2019 at almost \n$16 per hour, and has received wage increases to her present income of $21 per hour. \nShe supplemented her income during tax season in 2019 through part-time income at \n$12 per hour. With that part-time income, she made one $160 payment on her $108,000 \nconsolidated student loan in July 2019. Applicant acted responsibly to apply for an \nincome-based repayment plan with her federal loan servicer, which determined that she \ndid not have to pay anything on her student loan. However, she did not exercise sound \nfinancial judgment in other aspects. While it is understandable that she focus her limited \ndiscretionary income on repaying the judgment debts, she failed to monitor the payments \non some of the judgments, and failed to note that automatic payments had stopped. \nThose debts were eventually paid off in the summer of 2020, after the SOR was issued. \nAs for the debts not brought to court, Applicant has made no effort to contact her creditors \nin an attempt to negotiate even minimal payments. As those creditors go unpaid, she has \nopened new credit-card accounts on which she incurred balances in an effort to \nrehabilitate her credit. Her failure to give priority to her old debts casts some doubt on her \nfinancial judgment. \nMitigation only minimally applies with respect to AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). Applicant \nhas satisfied some judgment debts, including the credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.u. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established with respect to those two debts. Applicant\u2019s student loans are \nnot currently in default because of the CARES Act and the income-based repayment \nagreement with the loan servicer. Her present income-based repayment plan, which did \nnot require her to pay anything on her federal student loans, expired on May 7, 2021. See \nAE A. The present extension of the CARES Act, which provides for the suspension of \nfederal student-loan payments and collection actions on defaulted student loans, is \nscheduled to continue through September 30, 2021. Whenever those loans are no longer \nin \u201cnational emergency forbearance,\u201d Applicant intends to apply for another income-based \nrepayment plan, which is considered a good-faith effort to resolve her debts. Even so, it \nwould be premature to conclude that there is sufficient mitigation under either AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nor 20(d). The prospect of having to repay some $210,959 in student-loan debts looms \nover Applicant, even if she is granted another repayment plan that does not require her \nto pay anything based on her income in the near future. She has made no effort to address \nmore than $14,000 in delinquent consumer-credit balances. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are only partially mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to her fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s financial struggles persist largely because her spouse has been unable or \nunwilling to look for work since September 2017. At the same time, it is not clear that she \nhas done all that she can to work with her creditors to address obligations for which she \nremains legally liable. On her present household income, her $210,959 in student-loan \nbalances appear to be unmanageable. While the student loans are considered an \ninvestment in one\u2019s future, one has to question her financial judgment in taking on so \nmuch educational debt for herself and her son without a realistic prospect of repayment \nbased on her household income. Several of the loans were obtained before her spouse \nmoved to the Caribbean for more stable work. There is no evidence that Applicant has \nhad financial counseling.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or \nrevoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. \n29, 2009), (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is \na strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont \nv. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at \nthis time. This does not mean that, at some future date, Applicant\u2019s financial situation may \nstabilize sufficiently to enable a predictive judgment that she can make payments on her \npast-due debts and sizeable student loans. As the record stands, I have lingering doubts \nabout her financial judgment. \n  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.t: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant mother, brother, and one of his sisters are citizens and residents of \nPakistan. He owns a house in Pakistan with an estimated value in U.S. dollars of \n$225,000, and he has a bank account in Pakistan with about $8,000 to $9,000. The \npotential for terrorist and other violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high \nin Pakistan, and it continues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts and assets create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Pakistan. Guideline B is not limited \nto countries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding sensitive information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. He came to the United States in 1980 and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1994. His children and grandchildren are all in the United \nStates or Canada. He expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, which he \nconsiders his home. He credibly testified that his family and financial interests in \nPakistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing sensitive \ninformation. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Pakistan are outweighed by his deep and long\u00ad\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the \ninterests of Pakistan. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

His admissions incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2006 to 2011, though he and his wife were separated during some of that period. That relationship produced no children. Applicant and his second wife have been married for four years, and cohabitated for several years before that. They are now separated, and Applicant filed for divorce in December 2019. The divorce remains pending. (Tr. 22-23, 93) They have one daughter, age 13. She lives with her mother in another state. Applicant is current on his $800 monthly child support.

The DOD took the action under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThrough counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on or about January 4, 2021 (Tr. \n23-26) and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2021. \nApplicant requested an expedited hearing by video teleconference. (Tr. 9) On May 12, \n2021, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the video-teleconference hearing through the \nDefense Collaboration Services (DCS), to occur on May 20, 2021. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1-6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 H, of which AE A \u2013 AE E were \nprovided with the SOR response. AE A \u2013 AE F, and AE H were admitted without objection. \nAE G is a policy memorandum from President Biden, dated February 4, 2021. As \nDepartment Counsel noted, it is more properly considered for administrative notice (AN) \npurposes, and not as a substantive exhibit, so it was relabeled as AN G. A ruling on \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s relevance objection was deferred. (Tr. 19-21) AN G is described \nfurther in the \u201cAdministrative Notice\u201d section, below, and addressed in the Analysis \nsection as appropriate. \nI left the record open until June 1, 2021, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional information. On May 25, 2021, he provided four additional exhibits, which are \nmarked as AE I \u2013 AE L and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non June 2, 2021. Issuance of the decision was unexpectedly delayed because I was out \nof the office due to an extended family emergency in June 2021. I advised the parties of \nthat fact by e-mail on June 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p with explanations. I construe his \nanswers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b as denials of intent to falsify his SCA. His admissions \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2006 to 2011, though he and his \nwife were separated during some of that period. That relationship produced no children. \nApplicant and his second wife have been married for four years, and cohabitated for \nseveral years before that. They are now separated, and Applicant filed for divorce in \nDecember 2019. The divorce remains pending. (Tr. 22-23, 93) They have one daughter, \nage 13. She lives with her mother in another state. Applicant is current on his $800 \nmonthly child support. (Tr. 68-69) Applicant\u2019s wife also has two children of her own (ages \n21 and 19) from a prior relationship. He has helped them financially. (Tr. 68-70, 99-100) \nAfter graduating from high school in 2005, Applicant served in the U.S. Navy on \nactive duty for four years, until June 2009. (Tr. 70-71; AE I) He reported on his SCA that \nfrom June 2009 to June 2014, he was largely unemployed.

(Tr. 23, 60-61, 72-\n73)  \nFrom about September 2012 to June 2013 and from August 2013 to January 2014, \nApplicant held some temporary, part-time positions. He also had a later job, from June \n2014 to an undefined period, as a construction worker. (Tr. 44-45) In June 2014, Applicant \nenlisted in the Army National Guard (ANG). (GE 1 at 15-21; Tr. 27) He deployed to the \nMiddle East with his unit for several months in 2017 and 2018. (AE I) He continues to \nserve in the ANG, in an active reserve capacity. His reserve unit is in a different state \nmany hours from where he now lives, so he arranges to do his reserve time all at once. \n(GE 2 at 2; Tr. 45-46, 83-85) The home where Applicant\u2019s wife lives is a rental. His home \nin the locale where he works is paid for by his employer. (Tr. 90) \nSince February 2018, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as a \nshipboard engineer or mechanic on a maritime prepositioning ship. (Tr. 84-85; GE 1) \nFrom July 2019 to December 2020, he was deployed overseas with the ship. (Tr. 83) He \nsaid he does not need a security clearance for his current job, but has applied for one so \nhe can be promoted to supervisor. (GE 1 at 15-21; Tr. 11, 21-22, 81) He also said he was \nplaced on paid administrative leave the week before the hearing. (Tr. 81-82, 94) He was \nearning $27.62 an hour. (Tr. 85) \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern multiple federal debts, mostly \nstudent loans, some cell-phone debts, medical debts, and a charged-off debt relating to \na car. The debts are listed on credit reports from March 2018 and August 2019. (GE 3, \nGE 4) GE 5, a 2021 credit report, reflects that Applicant\u2019s credit file has been frozen. \nApplicant testified that his five-year period of unemployment or underemployment \n(2009-2014) began after his wife gave birth to their first child. She, too, was unemployed \nat the time. (Tr. 40, 94) Applicant testified that he was pursuing an education full time \nduring these years. He testified that he supported himself through the 9/11 GI Bill. (Tr. \n72-73, 94; AE L) He testified that his unemployment impacted his ability to pay his debts. \n(Tr. 29-30) GE 6, a 2014 credit report, reflects numerous delinquent accounts, including \nfederal student loans, debts to the VA, and other debts from that time period. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($11,999) is a charged-off account relating to an automobile. Applicant \nsaid his wife purchased a car when he was working or serving overseas. (Tr. 26, 50-58) \nRecent documentation shows that the amount currently owed is $9,376. (Tr. 58-59; AE F \nat 11) It remains delinquent. Applicant attributed this to being absent from home, either \non deployment or living separately from his wife and returning home only for military drills. \n(Tr. 57) He acknowledged financial responsibility for the car, even though it was his wife\u2019s. \n(Tr. 101) This debt is unresolved.

(Tr. 91) \nApplicant, through his wife, retained a law firm to manage his student loans. He \nsaid that during the period of his deployment to the Middle East in 2017, he paid the law \nfirm about $250 per paycheck for about eight months, but the debts were not resolved. \n(Tr. 29, 63-65) AE J reflects one payment to the law firm in November 2017, for about \n$120. \nIn December 2020, Applicant consolidated his federal student loans together in an \norganized payment plan. (Tr. 31; Answer; AE D) Six of the eight student loan accounts \nare listed on AE D, a letter to Applicant from a collection agency concerning a \nrehabilitation plan. Under the plan, Applicant was to make nine monthly payments of \nabout $401, beginning in mid-December 2020. (AE D; Tr. 31) He has missed payments, \nwhich he said was because he had to pay to retain legal counsel (for this hearing). He \nsaid he is in contact with the collection agency and intends to make future payments. (Tr. \n61-62) Applicant believes that all of his federal student loans are consolidated together, \nas detailed in AE D. (Tr. 77) The student loans remain unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($2,108) and 1.g ($6,308) are accounts placed for collection by the \nVA. The origin of these debts is rather unclear. Applicant stated in his Answer that this \nwas an \u201coverpayment\u201d of housing payments taken from his drill checks that were stopped \nwhen he went on deployment and then placed for collection. (Answer; Tr. 30-31) He later \nsaid they were overpayments of BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) payments that he \nreceived under the 9/11 GI Bill. (Tr. 47-48) \nApplicant asserted that he received BAH during his years of unemployment (2009\u00ad\n2014), years in which he was neither on active duty (2005-2009) or active in the ANG, \neither in reserve drill status or deployed on active duty (2014 to present). He also asserted \nthat his BAH allotment during this period was not enough to pay his bills, which is why he \nfell behind. (Tr. 73-76) He also testified that a 2017 deployment to a remote location in \nthe Middle East made it difficult to monitor his finances. His wife was in charge of the \nhousehold bills. (Tr. 62-64) \nApplicant stated that his wife initially retained a law firm to resolve these debts, but \nthey took no action. He said he has entered into a payment plan, and that the debts were \nbeing resolved through withholdings from his military drill checks. (Answer; Tr. 30, 48-49, \n91) This is undocumented. He said his tax returns have been filed, but he did not know if \nany federal tax refunds had been withheld to address his federal debts. (Tr. 67-68) He \nalso acknowledged knowing about the VA debts for a long time. (Tr. 50)  \nAE H is an internet printout from the VA website. It references an application for a \nfinancial status report (Form 5655) and an application for disability compensation (Form \n21-526EZ).

Applicant \nnoted in his Answer that the account is old, and the debt relates to a cancellation fee that \nhe was unaware of. While noting that the debt no longer appears on his credit report, he \nsaid he is paying it. (Answer) At hearing, he testified that this was a joint phone plan he \npreviously held with his wife. He said he currently has an account with the same phone \ncompany, and is in good standing. (Tr. 31-32, 81) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($375) is a debt placed for collection by a cable TV company for \nunreturned equipment. The debt is no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit report, but he said he \nwould pay it when he is able. (Answer) He testified that the debt remains delinquent, but \nhe intends to pay it, though he later said he was not aware of it. (Tr. 33, 80) \nApplicant said he has not had any formal credit counseling, but he is now more \n\u201cself-aware\u201d of his credit status. He said he had no other delinquent debts beyond what \nis alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 86-88) He showed evidence of payments on other debts, not \nalleged, and provided evidence of improved finances (excerpts from a May 2021 credit \nreport. (AE E, AE F) \nIn March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education \nbegan providing temporary relief on federal student loans, including suspension of loan \npayments and collections on defaulted student loans.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nOn February 4, 2021, President Biden issued a \u201cMemorandum on Revitalizing \nAmerica\u2019s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and \nPartnerships.\u201d (Presidential Memorandum) I took administrative of the document, as \nrequested, and considered the argument made by Applicant\u2019s counsel as to its relevance \nto this case. (AN G; Tr. 18-21, 120-122) Having reviewed and considered AN G, I \nconclude that there is nothing in the Presidential Memorandum that supersedes SEAD 4 \nor DOD Directive 5220.6, both of which remain in force. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern multiple federal debts, mostly \nstudent loans, some cell-phone debts, medical debts, and a charged-off debt relating to \na car. The SOR debts are listed on credit reports in the record, including from March 2018 \nand August 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. As noted, SOR \u00b6 1.p is a duplicate and \nis found for Applicant on that basis. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began a number of years ago, after he left the Navy in \n2009. For most of the next five years, he was largely unemployed. He was attempting to \nfurther his education during this period, and used federal student loans to do so. He and \nhis wife were also raising a young child during this time. It is not clear from the record \nhow he and his wife supported themselves during that period, as neither of them were \nworking. He may have lived off of his student loans, though this is not clear. GE 6, a 2014 \ncredit report, reflects numerous delinquent accounts, including federal student loans, \ndebts to the VA, and other debts. \nApplicant was gainfully employed in his current position from February 2018 until \nthe hearing, or shortly thereafter. He also has additional employment through the ANG. \nSome of his debts were incurred during deployments, either with the ANG or through his \ncontractor position, and some of them, such as the auto repossession at SOR \u00b6 1.a, were \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nincurred by his wife, during this period. Applicant has numerous delinquent accounts that \nremain ongoing and unresolved. Most of them are debts to the federal government, as \nthey are either federal student loans, or debts owed to the VA. He has made little effort \nuntil recently, however, to begin to address his debts. \nPayment of Applicant\u2019s federal student loans are likely suspended due to President \nBiden\u2019s Executive Order. However, this does not excuse or eliminate the fact that they \nhave been delinquent for years. Applicant has a rehabilitation plan in place as of \nDecember 2020, but he did not make any payments on it. His student loans, like his debts \nto the VA, remain ongoing and unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that AG \u00b6 20(b) should fully apply. He was \nunemployed, or underemployed, for several years after leaving the Navy. However, that \nwas many years ago, and Applicant was employed both as a contractor from February \n2018 until the hearing and has been in the ANG since 2014. He is long divorced from his \nfirst wife, and he has not demonstrated that his separation from his second wife is a \nfinancial hardship, since his rent is covered by his employer. Applicant has not \nestablished that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nApplicant has not pursued credit counseling. His testimony that he is now more \n\u201cself-aware\u201d of his finances is not sufficient. Applicant has also not established that there \nare clear indications that his financial issues are being resolved or are under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s small medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.n) are resolved. Otherwise, AG \n\u00b6 20(d) has little application. Applicant has a rehabilitation plan in place as of December \n2020 for his federal student loans, but he did not make any payments on it. The fact that \nApplicant says he intends to pay them is not sufficient evidence of good-faith efforts to do \nso. Applicant testified that his debts to the VA are being resolved through garnishment of \nhis drill pay. This is not documented.

AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant allegedly falsified his SCA in \nfailing to disclose either his federal debts, to the Department of Education and to the VA \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) or his various other charged-off debts and debts in collection (SOR \u00b6 2.b), \nas required. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to all the financial questions on the SCA, and indicated \nonly that he was \u201cworking with [a] credit repair company to fix old issues.\u201d (GE 1 at 37) I \nhave construed his answers to Guideline E as denials to the allegations of deliberate \nfalsification. \nThe Government established that Applicant had numerous delinquents, including \nfederal debts, in February 2018, when he prepared his SCA. Applicant testified that he \nhad retained a law firm to resolve his debts and thought they were being addressed. \nHowever, his description on his SCA of his financial problems as \u201cold issues\u201d is telling, as \nit appears he did not want to acknowledge that he had current delinquencies. He also \nacknowledged that he knew about his VA debts for some time. He also had a long history \nof debts, both generally and federal debts in particular, going back to his years of \nunderemployment and unemployment. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s passing reference to \ncredit counseling on his SCA was not a sufficient disclosure of his financial delinquencies. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nFalsification of a security clearance application is a serious matter. It goes to the \nheart of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. Once disqualifying conditions are \nestablished, Applicant has the burden to establish mitigation. He has not done so. He did \nnot disclose his debts until he was confronted about them in his interview. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) \nand (c) do not apply. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has a long history of financial instability and poor judgment. Most of his \ndebts are to the federal government. This a direct bearing on his eligibility to hold a federal \nsecurity clearance. Applicant\u2019s debts will remain a security concern until he shows a \ndocumented track record of good-faith efforts to resolve them, and to be honest about \nthem. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e, 1.g-1.m, 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.n, 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(SOR; SOR Answer) \nThis is not Applicant\u2019s first DOHA hearing for drug-related security concerns. On \nAugust 23, 2011, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR, followed by a hearing on February \n15, 2012, discussed below.

(Tr. 36-38) He \ncould not recall during direct examination the precise number of times he used \nmarijuana during college. His wife does not drink, smoke, or use any illegal drugs. (Tr. \n46-47) After beginning his current job in 2005, he stated that he used marijuana three \ntimes. (SOR Answer; Tr. 38-39) The last time he used marijuana was in 2017 at his \nfather-in-law\u2019s funeral. His family was in a circle sharing memories, and a \u201cjoint was \npassed around.\u201d Applicant had previously held a clearance from January 2005 to \nSeptember 2008 and had used marijuana a \u201cfew times\u201d during that period. (Tr. 39-40) \nApplicant knew it was wrong to do that and self-reported his marijuana use. (Tr. 40) \nApplicant has disassociated himself \u201c100 percent\u201d from the individuals with whom \nhe smoked marijuana. He submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance abuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He also submitted a \nCertificate of Completion for a four-hour Drug and Alcohol Awareness Class completed \non September 18, 2017. Applicant stated that he has no desire to use marijuana, and \nhe does not have any intent to use marijuana in the future. He took a privately \nadministered drug test on January 11, 2021, the day before his hearing that was \nnegative. (Tr. 40-42, 57; SOR Answer (Exhibits 1 and 2); AE B) \nApplicant acknowledged that he was informed of his company\u2019s zero tolerance \ndrug-use policy when he was hired in 2005. He has never been required to take a \nrandom drug test since he began his employment. (Tr. 47-49) \nDuring cross-examination, Department Counsel elicited further details from \nApplicant regarding his past marijuana use. During his first year of employment in 2005, \nhe used marijuana \u201cabout five times during holidays and visits with friends.\u201d The next \nyear in 2006, he used marijuana \u201cabout three times during holidays with friends.\u201d In \naddition, in 2007, he used marijuana \u201ca couple of times also during the holidays.\u201d In \n2008, he used marijuana \u201cabout one time.\u201d (GE 2; Tr. 49-50) When Applicant completed \nan SF-86 on February 8, 2005, he denied any prior drug use. He completed an SF-86 \non May 15, 2008, and again denied any prior drug use. However, during an August 3, \n2009 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview preceding a polygraph, he \ndisclosed his prior marijuana use. (GE 3, GE 6, GE 8; Tr. 50-51)  \nAs noted, Applicant appeared at a DOHA hearing on February 15, 2012. His \nSOR listed three allegations of drug use to which he admitted.

Applicant had \nbeen granted a security clearance in November 2005, and eligibility for access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) in July 2008. His clearance and SCI access \nwere revoked in January 2010 because of drug involvement and personal conduct \nissues. Applicant stated at his 2010 hearing that he did not currently use drugs and had \nno desire to use drugs in the future. (GE 8, Tr. 52) \nAfter his polygraph interview, Applicant stated that he did not use marijuana until \nNovember 2016 when his father-in-law was placed in hospice care, then again in April \n2017 at the birthday party for his wife and father-in-law, and again in June 2017 when \nthe family spread his father-in-law\u2019s ashes.

He added that he was \u201ca bit ignorant and \nna\u00efve . . . believing that the laws had changed,\u201d but knew it was wrong because his \nemployer had a zero tolerance drug policy. (Tr. 53-56) Applicant stated that he did not \nuse marijuana in 2018, 2019, 2020, or 2021. (Tr. 57) He also stated that he has been \ntruthful about all of his past marijuana use. (Tr. 57-58) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant is active in his community. He has always sought to find a family within \nthe community. To that end, he coaches legal robotics and soccer, and has done so in \nunderrepresented communities. He was the team manager for his son\u2019s soccer team for \nthe past four years. He also mentors junior engineers at his job site. Applicant earns a \ngood income and enjoys his work, but his career \u201chit a plateau\u201d because of his inability \nto work on classified projects. He considers himself a talented engineer who helped win \na \u201cmulti-billion-dollar program,\u201d a program that he worked on for six years. (Tr. 22, 32, \n42-44) \nApplicant submitted several pre- and post-employment certificates, awards, and \nacademic scholarships. (SOR Answer, Exhibits, 3-6, 9) His 2017 and 2018 annual \nevaluations reflect sustained superior performance and document Applicant\u2019s \ncontributions as a trusted and valued employee. His 2018 evaluation notes that \nApplicant\u2019s technical skills are \u201ctop notch\u201d and that \u201che is always willing to help.\u201d The \nsame evaluation gave him an overall rating of \u201cExceptional Contribution.\u201d Applicant also \nsubmitted nine work-related certificates from 2006 to 2009 that acknowledge his \ncontributions on various company projects. He has received three patents and one \ninnovation award. (SOR Answer, Exhibit 7; Tr. 29-31) Applicant considers his \naccomplishment of consistently receiving Technical Honors Awards every four years, a \ntotal of three, as his most distinguished professional recognition. His personnel file \nindicates that he has received 29 awards for various accomplishments from November \n2016 to January 2020.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Applicant admitted and the record established these two disqualifying \nconditions. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between 1993 and June \n2017. He also used marijuana on various occasions between January 2005 and \nSeptember 2008, while granted access to classified information. Consideration of \nmitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For \nthe recency analysis, the Appeal Board stated:  \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s most recent abuse of marijuana occurred in June 2017, about three-\nand-one-half years before his hearing. Applicant asserts that he has turned his life \naround, no longer wants to use marijuana, and will not use it in the future. The problem \nhere is that he appeared at a DOHA hearing on February 15, 2012, for drug \ninvolvement and drug-related falsification personal conduct concerns. At that hearing, \nApplicant made similar promises and then used marijuana after his 2012 hearing. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant did not provide a convincing account of his past marijuana \nuse. After minimizing his past marijuana use on direct examination, he added additional \ninstances of marijuana use when pressed by Department Counsel. Even now, I am not \nconfident that he has revealed all of his marijuana use. He was unable to adequately \nexplain his continued marijuana use after being employed in the defense industry and \nreceiving a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s previous 2012 DOHA hearing failed to make \na convincing impression on him. In light of Applicant\u2019s failure to live up to his past \npromises of future abstinence from marijuana, I do not have the confidence that he will \nlive up to his most recent promises. Additional time is required to evaluate Applicant\u2019s \nsincerity and trustworthiness. Accordingly, mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nwarranted at this time. Applicant established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) for \ncompliance with subsections (1), (2), and (3); however, the overall circumstances do not \nwarrant full mitigation of security concerns under Guideline H. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guideline H is incorporated \nin this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior principal engineer, who is an intelligent and \naccomplished individual. There is little doubt that he is well regarded by his company \nand is a valued employee. In addition to his multiple professional benchmark successes, \nhe is involved in his two son\u2019s lives, and contributes to his community. \nHowever, the fact that Applicant has returned to this venue for another hearing is \nof concern. The previous DOHA hearing apparently failed to convince Applicant that \ndrug use is not compatible with access to classified information. While Applicant \nreceives credit for self-reporting his drug use, such credit is overshadowed by the poor \njudgment he exercised by continuing to use marijuana on multiple occasions after his \n2012 DOHA hearing. Applicant\u2019s violation of past promises to abstain from using \nmarijuana, before and during his 2012 DOHA hearing, has brought his reliability and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness into question and raises questions about his willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 14, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 50, married in 2018 and has one adult son. She obtained her \nMaster\u2019s degree in 2003. Applicant completed her security clearance application on \nAugust 22, 2018. She has been employed with her current employer since 2016. She \nhas held a security clearance since 2008. (GE 1). \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has eleven delinquent debts, three for medical \ncollection accounts in the approximate amount of $99. The debts include seven \ndelinquent student loan debts in the approximate amount of $216,847. Applicant denied \nthat all allegations for student loans were not paid or past due. (SOR)The SOR further \nalleged a collection account for an apartment in the amount of $489. \nApplicant acknowledged that not all of the student loans belonged to her. She \nexplained that she obtained some for her son so that he could complete his college \neducation, and that she was a single parent. (Tr. 18). She could not recall the amount of \nmoney for the student loans which belonged to her. (Tr. 18) In her 2019 subject interview, \nshe stated that some of the student loans were duplicates on her credit reports after she \nhad consolidated some of the student loans. (GE 2) In her DOHA interrogatories, she \nstated that all the student loans were paid, that she had a payment plan, but that she had \nno documentation to show payments. At the hearing, Applicant had no idea how the \nstudent loans were combined. (Tr. 23) \nThe student loans date from 2000 until 2011. (Tr. 44) Applicant stated she had a \nrepayment plan for a few years with one servicer, but did not realize that it expired after \none year. However, she received an email that stated the servicing agent had changed \nand directed her to the proper source. (GE 4) She claims she continued to make \npayments but they were not counted. (Tr. 20) None of this information on student loans \nwas included in her security clearance application. \nApplicant presented a document showing rehabilitation terms and conditions, for \nher student loans, dated December 2019. The first payment of $633 was due in January \n2020. (AE) F She believed the payment is for the student loans alleged in SOR 1.a \nthrough 1.d. (Tr. 23) \nApplicant submitted post-hearing documentation concerning the payments made \nbut there were no account numbers to match the student loans, and the various payments \nwere started in 2019. There was a copy of a note from federal student aid that some or \nall of the federal student loans were rehabilitated from September 2019 until November \n2020. There is no connection to discern which student loans were rehabilitated. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs for the medical accounts in 1.e, 1. 1g, and 1.h, Applicant presented a receipt \nfor a total amount of $117 paid on February 13, 2020. (AE H) \nApplicant denied that she owed the alleged 2018 debt of $489 in 1.f. She told \ninvestigators that she was not aware of this debt. She explained at the hearing that it was \na debt from an apartment that her son was renting in college. She co-signed the loan. \n(Tr.25) She stated that it has been removed from her credit report. She had not tried to \nresolve this debt. \nAs to the student loan accounts in 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k., Applicant claimed that they \nwere also in consolidation and she has been paying the $633 for the loans. (Tr. 28) The \npost-hearing submission (AE J) did not substantiate her claim. \nApplicant presented a letter of recommendation and employee reviews. (AE C ) \nand D. She also presented performance reviews which attest that she is competent and \nhandles her duties in a professional manner. (AE C and D). \nApplicant earns approximately $120,000 a year. (Tr. 34) A pay stub (GE 4) shows \nthat her earnings for a pay period in 2019 were $ 158,938. Applicant acknowledged that \nmay have included bonuses. Her husband earns approximately $150-$160,000 per year. \n(Tr.37) Applicant has a net remainder of approximately $1,000. (Tr.41) She has no written \nbudget and has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau report shows that the reason for her credit score is that \nshe has too many over-due accounts. (AE I) The original amount of her student loan \naccounts was approximately $60,000 to $70,000, but due to defaulted payments or no \npayments until 2019 or 2020 the amount is now over $200,000. \nAlthough the SOR does not contain any allegation with regard to federal or state \ntax liens, when asked routine financial question by the Government, she stated that she \nhad none. (Tr. 58) Applicant\u2019s final post-hearing submission (AE K) shows she contacted \na tax attorney on November 19, 2020 to resolve the issue of the tax liens (federal and \nstate) for delinquent taxes from about 2009 until 2011. (GE 7 and 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe Government established its prima facie case, establishing two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s student debts are long-standing and she acknowledges that she was \nnot sure which student loan accounts were her and which were her son\u2019s accounts. They \noriginated in 2001. Until 2019 or 2020, Applicant did not apply for rehabilitation. She gave \nvarious reasons for her financial situation that were not credible. She produced no \ndocumentation to connect which student loans were consolidated. She completed a \nrehabilitation program for some of the student loans but from the documentation, it is not \nclear which accounts are included. The student loans were not due to circumstances \nbeyond her control. She paid a medical account and presented documentation that \napplies to three alleged medical accounts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. She has not acted \nresponsibly to address the resulting debts.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control. She \nhas not shown that she has acted in good faith throughout the past 20 years. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. She was not credible in her testimony and failed to document with sufficient \nevidence that she has mitigated the financial concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F , and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including credibility and openness at the hearing, I conclude that \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. All \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 26) Before driving for his current company he worked for a \ndifferent freight line from October 2015 to January 2018. \nApplicant owes money to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for disability \nfunds he started receiving in 2010. (Ex. 2) His then employer put him on medical leave \nwhile he was receiving treatment for his stage IV lung cancer and terminated him when \nhis sick leave ran out. (Tr. 23) With the loss of his employment his medical insurance \nended. He began to receive disability compensation from the SSA. \nIn October 2015, he started training to become a truck driver, and eventually \nobtained a commercial driver\u2019s license. (Tr. 29) He notified the SSA of his employment \nwhen he began earning income as a commercial truck driver. (Tr. 24) After notifying the \nSSA he was working, he received a letter from SSA informing him that his case would be \nreviewed and that he was still eligible to receive disability payments. In January 2017, he \nreceived another letter stating the same thing. (Tr. 24) At some point thereafter, SSA sent \nhim a letter stating he had been overpaid and demanding he repay the funds at $2,000 \nper month. (Tr. 24) He was not in a position to pay that amount. He intends to contact the \nSSA again in an attempt to reach an affordable monthly amount. (Tr. 70) He had \npurchased a boat in 2015, however, when he did so he was unaware of the debt owed to \nSSA. (Tr. 77) \nThe SSA disability payments should have stopped in October 2016. Applicant was \noverpaid between $20,000 and $22,000. His November 2019 credit report lists a \ncollection balance of $21,303 on this SSA account. (Ex. 11) Having finished paying $820 \nmonthly on his Federal Tax debt, he is now in a position to arrange a repayment plan with \nSSA and to start making payments. (Tr. 24) \nOn Applicant\u2019s March 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) he listed he was repaying his 2005 and 2015 federal income taxes. \n(Ex. 1) As of March 2019, he owed $9,995 in Federal income taxes for year 2005. (Ex. 3) \nIn April 2016, a $27,071 Federal tax lien was filed against Applicant for tax years 2002 \n($207) and 2005 ($26,864). (Ex. 9) As of June 21, 2021 the Federal tax lien was released. \n(Ex. C) \nIn 2005, after his sister and parent\u2019s died, and he was terminated from his job, \nApplicant cashed out his pension. At that time, he believed the company had withheld the \nproper taxes before providing him with the balance. (Tr. 21, 36, 49) He stated his income \ntax and the taxes on his sister\u2019s and parents\u2019 estates had added to the confusion and \nmiscalculation of taxes owed. The result was he owed $7,866 in Federal income taxes \nand $9,995 in state taxes. During his November 2018 enhanced subject interview, he \nindicated he was paying $829 per month on his delinquent taxes. (Ex. 2, 3) His IRS \naccount transcript shows payments starting in November 2009 and ending in July 2019. \nMost of his monthly payments were for $820. (Ex. 3) \nApplicant\u2019s IRS account transcript dated July 2019 indicates he owed $3,165 in \nFederal income tax when he filed his 2015 tax return in April 2016. He had $4,795 \nwithheld for 2015.

(Ex. 3) As of May 12, 2021, Applicant had paid \n$27,071 for the release of the Federal tax lien for tax years 2002 and tax year 2005. (Ex. \nC) \nIn April 2005, a $1,460 state tax lien was filed against Applicant and in April 2008, \nan $8,700 state tax lien was filed against him. (Ex. 9) A letter from the state Franchise \nTax Board concerning delinquent state taxes was not timely received by him because he \nhad moved to another state. (Tr. 39) Additionally, he was going through a divorce that \nwas finalized in August 2005, which added to his financial problems. (Tr. 40, 74) When \nhe received the notice that state taxes were owed, he immediately contacted the state \ntax authority and established a repayment plan. (Tr. 40) In 2016, Applicant began making \nregular $250 monthly payments to the state Franchise Tax Board. (Tr. 22, 38, 41) As of \nMarch 2020, he owed $7,475 on this debt. By March 2021, he had reduced the amount \nto $4,758. (Ex. D and E) \nApplicant continues to make monthly payments of $250 each to the Franchise Tax \nBoard. He provided documentation of his payments in March, April, and May 2021. (Exs. \nF, G, H) As of July 2019, his 2015 state tax liability for his current state of residence had \nbeen satisfied. (Ex. 3) \nDuring security clearance processing, Applicant was made aware that three \nfinancial judgments had been filed against him. (Tr. 71) In April 2004, a credit union \nobtained a default judgment in the amount of $10,668 against him for his default on a loan \nfor a pickup truck that was repossessed (SOR 1.h). (Ex. 4, Tr. 43) In January 2006, a \nfinancial corporation obtained a default judgment in the amount of $10,085 against him \n(SOR 1.i). (Ex. 5, Tr. 47) In May 2007, a partnership obtained a default judgment in the \namount of $8,703 against him. (Ex. 6) Applicant intends to contact the creditors of the \njudgments and arrange repayment plans. (Tr. 51) \n \nAbout the judgment for the repossessed truck, Applicant stated that at the time of \nthe repossession, he was current on his loan payments and had full insurance coverage \non his vehicle. (Tr. 44) The credit union disputed he had insurance on the vehicle and \ntook out a loan insurance plan even after he had sent them proof of coverage. The credit \nunion\u2019s plan added $600 monthly to the cost of the loan. (Tr. 44) Unable to continue \npaying his insurance, the monthly loan payment, and the additional $600 charged by the \ncredit union for additional insurance, he let the vehicle be repossessed. After the \nrepossession, Applicant received no information as to a balance owed on the loan. (Tr. \n43) He has recently contacted the creditor who demanded he pay the entire amount owed \nimmediately. (Tr. 45) He is not in a position to do so. After addressing the remainder of \nhis past-due taxes and his social security obligation, he intends to pay this debt.  \nApplicant speculates the $10,085 judgment and the credit union judgment are the \nsame debt due to the original damages being so close in amount to the second judgment. \n(Tr. 47) Although there is no proof that they are the same debt. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has two small medical accounts in collection (SOR 1.l, $355 and SOR \n1.m, $820), which he believes are related to his lung cancer treatment. His credit report \ndoes not list a point of contact for the larger of the two accounts and lists only a post office \nbox for the other. He stated he would pay the amounts if he knew whom to contact. (Tr. \n52) \n \nApplicant is not having any problem meeting his day-to-day living expenses. (Tr. \n65) He and his fianc\u00e9 have made a $10,000 down payment on a $90,000 home. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant inherited real estate from his sister\u2019s estate which he hopes to sell for \napproximately $80,000 in the next few months.

(T. 48) The statute of limitations on the three judgments is ten years \nunder state law unless the judgments are renewed. None of the three judgments are \nlegally enforceable. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nApplicant failed to timely pay his Federal and state income taxes for 2005 (SOR \n1.a). He reached repayment agreements with the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board and \nhas honored those agreements. The evidenced does not establish SOR 1.b in that he did \nnot fail to file his Federal income tax return for tax year 2015. In fact, he received a refund \nof overpayment of taxes for that year.

He has a repayment agreement with the state Franchise Tax Board and is \nhonoring that agreement at a rate of $250 per month.

He had three \njudgments filed against him in 2004, 2006, and 2007. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal \nBoard explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally\nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations\nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden\nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for\nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n \n \n \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Six financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \nApplicant reached a repayment agreement with the IRS and paid $27,000 in \naccord with the agreement to address his 2002 and 2005 Federal income tax debts. His \nFederal income tax liens have been released. He has a repayment agreement with the \nstate Franchise Tax Board by which he makes $250 payments on his state income tax \ndebts (SOR 1.e ad 1.f). As of March 2021, he had reduced the balance owed to $4,758. \nHe provided evidence of three additional payments of $250 each in March 2021, April \n2021, and May 2021. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to his past-due Federal and state tax debts, which have now \nbeen paid or are being paid per repayment agreements. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because \nApplicant entered into repayment arrangements with the appropriate tax authorities and \nhas honored those agreements. Additionally, in his favor, he acted to address his tax \nissues prior to the receipt of the SOR. \nApplicant reportedly owed two small medical debts totaling approximately $1, 200, \nwhich he would pay, if he knew whom to pay. These small debts, even if unpaid, are \nrelatively minor in amount so that they are of minimal security significance. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies to the judgments, the most recent of which is more than 14 \nyears old. None of the judgments are legally enforceable. Additionally, the judgment \nresulting from the repossession of the pickup truck occurred under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. He was current on his monthly truck payments and \nhas the proper insurance on the vehicle. The action by the credit union to charge an \nadditional $600 monthly for insurance made it impossible for him to continue owning the \nvehicle. \nOnce Applicant has completed paying his state past-due taxes, he will address the \nsocial security debt. It should be noted that Applicant went to the SSA and told them he \nwas working, and the disability payments should stop. The response by SSA indicated \nthey were reviewing the matter and payment would continue. They sent him a second \nletter stating the same thing. Only later did the SSA determine there was an overpayment. \nApplicant did what he could in good faith to notify the SSA to stop making the disability \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments. He acknowledges he owes a debt to the SSA and intends to reach a \nrepayment agreement as soon as he has the financial ability to do so. Having made and \nhonored other repayment agreements, I believe he will honor a repayment agreement to \nthe SSA once made. \nApplicant has shown that he has a plan to resolve his delinquent obligations and \nthat he has taken significant steps to implement those plans. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s Federal income tax debt resulted when he had Stage IV cancer, his \nsick leave ended, his employer terminated his employment, and the company paid out \nhis retirement plan. He was mistaken in his belief that his company had withheld taxes \nbefore disbursing him the balance. This caused him to owe sizeable Federal and state \nliabilities that he did not expect and could not afford to repay at the time. Additionally, the \ndeath of his sister and parents around that time caused confusion with completing the \nestate tax returns and his income tax returns. His 2005 divorce added to his financial \nproblems. The events that led to his tax issues are unlikely to recur. More importantly, he \narranged repayment agreements with the IRS and state and has paid more than $30,000 \nto honor those repayment agreements. Having reached and honored such large \nrepayment agreements in the past, Applicant is likely to reach and honor a repayment \nagreement with the SSA once made. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nThe judgments can no longer be a source of financial pressure for him as they are \nbeyond the statute of limitations for collection. His financial issues have been adequately \naddressed to whether they no longer present an unacceptable security risk. \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid, it is whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about his eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national to grant Applicant a security clearance.

I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.

The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn January 14, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the allegations except \nsubparagraph 2.f.

Applicant \ndid not do so, whereupon the case was assigned to me on July 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old man with one child, age 9. Applicant was married twice \npreviously. Both marriages ended in divorce. (Item 1 at 17-19) He earned a high school \ndiploma in 2000, and he earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2005.

(Item 5 at 15) \nThe SOR alleges six debts totaling approximately $11,000. Applicant incurred them \nbetween 2012 and 2015. (Items 4-10) \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 2.a is a delinquent phone bill for $337.  (Item 3 at \n3) It stems from a cell phone call that his former stepdaughter made when she lived with \nhim. Applicant initially disputed the bill, contending that the phone company errantly \ncharged a long-distance rate for the phone call, bypassing a local cell phone tower in \nviolation of Federal Communications Commission regulations. (Item 5 at 3) By the date of \nApplicant\u2019s answer in January 2021, he had concluded that it was less expensive to pay \nthis bill than to contest it in court. (Item 3 at 3) He provided no evidence that he has either \npaid this bill or arranged a payment plan. \nSubparagraph 2.b, totaling $170, is a delinquent medical bill. (Item 3 at 3) Applicant \ncontends that the health care provider overcharged him, and that he met his deductible. \n(Item 3 at 3) He referenced an explanation of benefits form substantiating his contention, \nbut did not submit the form into the record. \nSubparagraph 2.c, totaling $82, is owed to a collection agent. In Applicant\u2019s answer, \nhe stated that he would pay this bill within a month. (Item 1 at 2) He provided no proof of \npayment. \nApplicant incurred the bill alleged in subparagraph 2.d, totaling $232, when his then \nwife took their daughter to the emergency room. While the hospital was checking her \ndaughter into their system, Applicant\u2019s then wife called him for their insurance information. \nHe told her that the emergency room was an out-of-network health provider, and to take \ntheir daughter to a nearby hospital that was in-network.

(Item 3 at 3) \nApplicant received a $232 bill from the out-of-network hospital even though his daughter \nhad not received treatment or finished checking in. His insurance carrier would not provide \npartial reimbursement because his daughter had not received service. The hospital that \nbilled him refused to negotiate a resolution. (Item 3 at 3) The bill remains outstanding. \nApplicant provided no documentation of any attempts to satisfy or resolve this bill. \nSubparagraph 2.e, totaling $129, is a utility disconnect fee Applicant incurred after \nhis home was destroyed by a fire in approximately 2016. (Item 3 at 4) Applicant contends \nthat he should not have been charged this fee because no disconnect services were \nprovided, as the electric meter melted during the fire. (Item 3 at 4) Applicant provided no \nrecord of any attempts to satisfy or resolve this debt. \nSubparagraph 2.f, totaling $10,013, is a property tax delinquency for the property \nthat Applicant owned before he purchased his current home. (Item 1 at 2) This debt was \nsatisfied after the property was sold at auction. (Item 3 at 5-8) It is unclear from the record \nwhether this was the house that was destroyed by the fire in 2016. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nUnder this guideline, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 24) \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, spanning 20 years, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany \nsubstance misuse.\u201d Although Applicant\u2019s marijuana use spanned 20 years, it was \ninfrequent, as he only used it approximately ten times during that period. Applicant has not \nused marijuana in nearly three and a half years, and he executed a statement in 2019, \ndeclaring his intent to not to use any marijuana in the future. Under these circumstances, \nAG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \u201cproviding a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility,\u201d apply. Applicant has acknowledged his drug involvement and is willing \nto abstain from marijuana in the future. I conclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement \nsecurity concern. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The delinquent property tax, which constituted 90 percent of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debt, was satisfied when Applicant sold the property in January 2020. \nOne of the remaining five debts, the debt alleged in subparagraph 2.a, was a phone \nbill that the service provider may have calculated improperly. The debt in subparagraph 2.b \nis a possible medical bill overcharge, and the debts in subparagraphs 2.d and 2.e were for \nservices that Applicant contends were never provided. Conversely, Applicant provided no \nevidence substantiating the basis of the disputes or any steps to resolve them. \nConsequently, AG \u00b6 20(e), the relevant mitigating condition (\u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d), does not apply. \nGiven the nominal amount of the remaining debts, I conclude that they are not \nsignificant enough to generate concerns about Applicant\u2019s overall financial stability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and F, and they warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.e: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Of particular note is the significant threat of \ncrime, terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and both countries limited \ncapacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. Russia\u2019s history of espionage against the \nUnited States and Iran\u2019s history of terrorist-related activities against the United States, \ncannot be overlooked.

He came to the United States in 1999 on a student visa and received a \nscholarship to attend a prestigious university. He went on to earn a bachelor of science \ndegree in electrical engineering, a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, and \ncompleted his coursework for a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Applicant\u2019s husband is a \nlawful permanent resident in the United States and is currently employed as director of \nengineering for a start-up company.

(Tr. 39, 53-55) \nIn November 2020, Applicant\u2019s husband retained an immigration attorney to \nassist him with the process to become a U.S. citizen. In November 2020, his attorney \nfiled his completed application for citizenship with all required application fees. \nApplicant\u2019s husband receives periodic updates from his immigration attorney regarding \nthe status of his pending application. As of May 4, 2021, the immigration attorney\u2019s \noffice advised Applicant\u2019s husband that \u201cUSCIS is processing applications filed on \n12/20/2019 (sic) with an estimated processing time of 13.5 to 16.5 months. As your \ncase was received on 11/16/2021, it is within normal processing times.\u201d (AE A, AE J, AE \nK, AE L) \nThe last concern centers on Applicant obtaining a Russian passport after \nobtaining a secret security clearance in 2009, and using that Russian passport to travel \nto Iran and Russia in 2013. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant stated that she is a dual citizen by \nbirth that she had a Russian passport going back to when she was in the Air Force, and \nthat holding a Russian passport was the only way she could visit her father in Russia, \nwho was very ill at the time. (Amended SOR Answer; Tr. 40-41; AE A) \nApplicant further stated that her then boyfriend, now husband, arranged the trips \nto Iran and Russia in 2013 as a surprise to her so they could meet their respective \nparents before marrying in 2014. Applicant informed her facility security officer (FSO) at \nthe time that she would be traveling, but did not know where. She did inform her FSO of \nwhere she had traveled on her return. A later FSO reported Applicant\u2019s use of a \nRussian passport to travel to Iran and Russia by Joint Personnel Adjudication System \n(JPAS) in 2016, some three years later, when Applicant disclosed such facts on her \nAugust 2, 2016 SF-86 when renewing her clearance.

Applicant has reported all subsequent foreign travel to her \nFSO. (Tr. 48-50, 65; GE 2; AE A, AE I, AE J) \nIn 2016, Applicant turned her Russian passport in, now expired, to her FSO. \nHowever, in 2019, her FSO returned her passport to her \u201cper SEAD\u201d after the \u201cUS \nGovernment changed their rules and she was able to keep her Russian passport.\u201d On \nJune 3, 2021, Applicant returned her expired Russian passport to her FSO where it \nremains today. Applicant kept her Russian passport for the sole purpose of being able \nto visit her father. She explained that because she is not a permanent citizen in Russia, \nshe does not have a \u201cfull\u201d Russian passport that would allow her to work in Russia. \nApplicant related that as she understands the rules, she is allowed to hold her Russian \npassport, but cannot travel using her Russian passport.

The company president provided very \nfavorable substantive comments about Applicant\u2019s dedication and commitment to the \nmission of the company and the company\u2019s mission to national security. The company \npresident added that Applicant has made significant contributions establishing and \ngrowing their company capabilities through capture and awareness of new contracts, \nsuccessful execution of their Government and commercial programs and in supporting \nthe company\u2019s growth, organizational structure and culture. The company president \nlauded Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States, her work ethic, values her contributions \nin supporting U.S. national security, and fully supports reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n Analysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the countries of Russia and Iran. The \nbehavior of the Russian and Iranian governments presents a serious national security \nconcern. The heightened-risk element is easily satisfied. Given Applicant\u2019s family ties to \nRussian and Iran, via her father, stepmother, spouse, and in-laws the Government has \nestablished its case under Guideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by \nthe evidence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position or having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRussia and Iran\u2019s relationship with the United States, and the heightened risk it \npresents, place a very heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With \nthat said, Applicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and \ntrustworthy person. She was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. She appears \nto have cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance \nprocess and during her OPM interview. She made a good impression upon me during \nthe hearing. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Russian via her father and \nstepmother, and of her ties to Iran via her spouse and mother-in-law and father-in-law. \nApplicant has a demonstrated record as a reliable clearance holder beginning with her \nAir Force service in 2001. Given her father and stepmother living in Russian and her in-\nlaws living in Iran, and her contacts with them, Applicant understands and is sensitive to \nthe nature of the security concern based on foreign influence. Although the family ties to \nRussia and Iran still count and cannot be dismissed out of hand, the strength of those \nties are diminished given the facts and circumstances here. On balance, her ties to the \nUnited States are far stronger than the family ties to Russia and Iran. \nGiven the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Russian or Iranian governments or her family \nmembers who have Russian or Iranian citizenship. I further conclude there is no conflict \nof interest, because Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships \nand loyalties in the United States that she can be expected to resolve any potential \nconflict of interest in the favor of the United States.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, component medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior . . . ; (2) any . . . inappropriate behavior; and (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThis allegation was added as an Amendment to the SOR. A review of the \nevidence supports Applicant\u2019s assertion that she did renew her Russian passport as \nalleged. However, she noted that she was a dual citizen of Russia and reported her \npossession of a Russian passport on her SF-86s when she was in the Air Force as well \nas when she was a defense contractor. She was granted security clearances in 2001 \nand again in 2009. Applicant explained and corroborated the circumstances that led up \nto her surprise trip arranged by her then boyfriend to Russia and Iran in 2013.

In reaching this conclusion, I have weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden or persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrebutted the allegation that she did not inform her FSO and employer about her travel to \nRussia and Iran, or that her FSO did not become aware of her use of a Russian \npassport until 2016. With the benefit of hindsight, Applicant realizes that this situation \ncould have been avoided. However, her explanation is credible and the facts as they \neventually unfolded are without significant security significance and further discussion of \nmitigating conditions is not warranted. It is clear from Applicant\u2019s demeanor that this \nprocess has made a significant impression on her and failures to timely and accurately \nreport information to her FSO are not likely to be repeated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR \nand Amended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She has never \nhad ties to the Pakistani government. According to Applicant\u2019s January 2019 e-QIP, \nApplicant had monthly contact with her by phone. At the December 2020 hearing, \nApplicant explained that the monthly telephonic contact was primarily initiated by her \nmother with Applicant exchanging brief pleasantries during the phone calls. Face-to-\nface contact has decreased because this aunt does not visit as much as she did in the \npast. Applicant spoke with her by phone about two months ago when this aunt came to \nthe Midwestern U.S. to visit her daughter (Applicant\u2019s recently naturalized cousin). \nApplicant\u2019s last face-to-face contact with this aunt was during an earlier trip two years \nago to the U.S. to visit her daughter.

(GE 1 at 41; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 49-51, 74, 79-80) \nApplicant\u2019s 72-year-old aunt is a housewife. Though Applicant indicated in \nJanuary 2019 that her phone contact was once a month, at the hearing, she clarified the \nmonthly contact as being less, primarily due to the family group chat sessions on social \nmedia, with Applicant speaking to this aunt three to four times a year.

Applicant does not know what this uncle\u2019s job was in the military. He has no \npresent ties to the Pakistani government. Applicant\u2019s social media contacts with him are \nfrom four times a year to once every two years, depending on whether she travels to \nPakistan. She could not recall when she last spoke with him by phone. This uncle does \nnot know she is applying for a security clearance or currently has a public trust \nclearance.

He has annual contact \nwith Applicant. Though she testified that she never contacted him by text, phone, or \nemail, she indicated in her January 2019 e-QIP and March 2019 PSI, that she had \ncontact with this cousin once a year by telephone and text. This uncle probably knows \nthat Applicant works in an IT position, but does not know whether she holds any kind of \nclearance. Though Applicant does not know where this cousin is currently stationed, the \ninformation that she placed in her January 2019 e-QIP identifying this cousin\u2019s rank and \njob location, came from this cousin\u2019s sister, who is also Applicant\u2019s 44-year-old cousin \ndescribed in SOR 1.c. (GE 1 at 37-39; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 58-59, 86-87) \n(2) Applicant\u2019s 46-year-old cousin was a wing commander in the Pakistani air \nforce. He joined the military right after graduating from college and left the service rather \nthan retire when he was about 40 years old (circa 2013). One of Applicant\u2019s aunts told \nher mother that this cousin left the service and is currently weighing his employment \noptions. She believes he will seek a commercial pilot position after the end of the \npandemic. Applicant described her contact with him as quarterly when her mother \ncontacts him. The last telephonic contact Applicant had with this cousin was in October \n2020, and the last face-to-face contact was in 2018 when she visited Pakistan.

In sum, the documentation and her credible testimony \nconvinces me that Applicant was not trying to misrepresent information regarding the \nmilitary background of either cousin. (GE 1 at 39-41; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 60-61, 84, 86-89, \n95) \n(3) Applicant has quarterly contact with her unemployed 45-year-old cousin. \nThere is no indication in the record that this cousin has ties to the Pakistani government \nor military (GE 1 at 28; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 53-54)  \n(4) In January 2019, Applicant had quarterly contact with her 44-year-old cousin \nby phone or electronically. This cousin, a housewife, has no ties with the Pakistani \ngovernment. The last time Applicant saw her was in April 2018 when she visited \nPakistan. This cousin used to live at another location in the U.S. and Applicant visited \nher many times. This cousin is not aware that Applicant is applying for a security \nclearance or currently has a public trust position.

This cousin is presently \nunemployed after working as a project manager for a private company that plans and \nproduces social events. When questioned why Applicant texts this cousin daily, she \nreplied that this cousin, Applicant, her sister, and Applicant\u2019s other cousin (a U.S. \ncitizen) living in the Midwestern U.S., participate in an electronic group chat room on \nsocial media. They talk about social events, but Applicant never talks about her work. \nHer last face-to-face contact with her 36-year-old cousin was in 2019 when this cousin \nwas in the United States visiting her sister (Applicant\u2019s other cousin who recently \nbecame a U.S. citizen). This cousin knows Applicant has a clearance but is unaware of \nthe type.

He is employed as a senior \nfinancial planner. (GE 1 at 33-34) \nApplicant traveled to Pakistan six times between 2010 and April 2018. The \nreasons for the trips were holiday events or weddings, except for the last trip in April \n2018, when Applicant\u2019s grandmother died. (GE 1 at 54-55; Tr. 45) Applicant has \nreported all foreign travel to her facility security officer (FSO). She understands that any \neffort to exert pressure on her must be reported to the FSO too. She has never been \ncited for a violation of public trust or CAC regulations and policies. She does not know \nwhether she will return to Pakistan.

Her brother-in-law, a \ntelecommunications employee with a security clearance, recommended Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance based on her ability to follow the rules and his belief that she would \nnot favor Pakistani interests over those of the U.S. (Tr. 10-16) \nA management consultant for a federal agency has held a public trust clearance \nfor the past three years. She has known Applicant 24 years as they grew up together. \nBased on her honesty and preference for the U.S., the consultant recommends \nApplicant for a security clearance.

(AE I at 17-22) \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Pakistan \nPakistan is a parliamentary Islamic republic with significant internal problems \ncaused by terrorist organizations concentrated in several locations within the country. In \nSeptember 2012, the United States officially declared the Haqqani Network a foreign \nterrorist organization. \nAs of 2014, parts of Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa province, and Balochistan province were regarded as safe havens for \nterrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, \nLasahkar I Jhangvi, and the Afghan Taliban. These groups create ongoing security \nproblems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority \npolitical groups, and religious entities. \nOperations in 2014 by the Pakistani military against some of the terror groups \nhad only marginal success. With the passage of time, there has been an overall decline \nin the scope and frequency of terrorist attacks. In 2019, the country took action against \nseveral terrorist groups by disrupting their financing and indicting some of their leaders. \nThe human rights record of Pakistan is not good. Extrajudicial killings, torture, \nand disappearances have been reported, along with intrusive government surveillance \nof politicians, political activists, and the media. Government and police corruption, \nsexual harassment, and gender discrimination are persistent problems. Pakistani \ngovernment authorities seldom punish government officials for human rights violations. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nThe nature of a country\u2019s government, its relationship to the United States, and \nits human rights record, are relevant in evaluating the chances that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government pressure or influence. Terrorist organizations \ncontinue to operate against the United States and Pakistani interests from safe havens \nwithin the country. The government has a poor human rights record that is exacerbated \nby the country\u2019s terrorism and violence. When evaluating an applicant\u2019s ties to foreign \nfamily members, the totality of an applicant\u2019s foreign family ties as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. Conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \nContacts and ties with family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. Applicant has three aunts, two uncles, and five cousins who are \nresident citizens of Pakistan. Her contacts with these foreign family members, which \nhave been electronically, face-to-face, or by phone, have fluctuated from infrequent with \nher 78-year-old uncle to daily with her 36-year-old cousin. None of her uncles and aunts \nare connected to the Pakistani government or military. However, her 48-year-old cousin \nis a major in the Pakistani army. His 46-year-old cousin was a wing commander in the \nPakistani air force before leaving the service at about age 40. The totality of these \ncontacts and the risk of terrorism in Pakistan generates a heightened risk of coercion or \nexploitation under AG \u00b6 7(a) and a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 (7(b). \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s aunts, uncles, and cousins are residents \nand citizens of Pakistan. One cousin is an active member of the Pakistani army, and \nanother cousin left the Pakistani air force in about 2013. Government operatives or \ninsurgent groups could exert pressure on Applicant through her foreign family members \nto obtain U.S. classified or sensitive information, or to damage the United States in \nsome other way. \nApplicant\u2019s contact-frequency with her foreign family members and her trips to \nattend family events in Pakistan, including her grandmother\u2019s funeral in April 2018, \ndemonstrate that her ties to her foreign family members are not casual and infrequent. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s credible testimony demonstrates that her loyalty \nto the United States is such that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest.

Applicant\u2019s \ncousin and her third uncle, naturalized U.S. citizens, live in the Midwestern part of the \ncountry. Applicant\u2019s yearly salary is $85,000. She owns an automobile and makes \nregular deposits to her U.S. retirement account which has grown to about $35,000. \nNeither Applicant nor her mother have any property or financial interests in Pakistan. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of \nall the surrounding circumstances in this case, including the heightened risk of terrorism \nin Pakistan. Applicant was born and raised in the United States. She earned her high \nschool diploma, her associate\u2019s degree, and her bachelor\u2019s degrees at U.S institutions. \nApplicant\u2019s former and current coworkers furnished telephonic evidence supporting her \napplication for a security clearance based on her honesty, reliability, and ability to \ncomply with rules. Applicant\u2019s written references are impressed with her honesty and \ndependability on her job and in her mother\u2019s child care business. Applicant\u2019s credible \ntestimony and impressive character evidence convinces me that she will resist, repel, \nand report to the proper officials any attempt to exert improper influence on her through \nher foreign family members. Considering the evidence from an overall commonsense \npoint of view, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by the foreign \ninfluence guideline. \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B): \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old, has been married for 34 years, and has two adult children. In 1984, he began working for a defense contractor as an engineer. He retired from that company after about 35 years. He then began working for a second defense contractor in 2019. He has continuously held a security clearance since 1984. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2000. He also earned a certificate in project management in 2005. (Tr. at 36-40.) Applicant disclosed in his 2014 SCA that he had not filed his tax year (TY) 2011 state tax return and that the state tax authority had issued a garnishment of his wages in the amount of $5,900. He noted that he intended to file the return in April 2014, which would result in the state releasing the garnishment. This disclosure and incident reports filed by Applicant\u2019s employer regarding his state wage garnishments triggered a review by the Government of Applicant\u2019s tax filings and payments for the TYs 2009 through 2018.

The incorrect number on the SOR has been corrected. On April 30, 2021, the \ncase was assigned to me. DOHA issued a hearing notice on July 19, 2021, scheduling \nthe hearing for August 12, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Prior to the hearing, \nApplicant submitted by email four documents.

I marked an additional exhibit presented by Applicant during the \nhearing as AE DD. (Hearing Transcript at 20-37, 92.) \nI kept the record open until August 26, 2021, to give Applicant the opportunity to \nsupplement the record.

(Tr. at 117-118.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old, has been married for 34 years, and has two adult \nchildren. In 1984, he began working for a defense contractor as an engineer. He retired \nfrom that company after about 35 years. He then began working for a second defense \ncontractor in 2019. He has continuously held a security clearance since 1984. He earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2000. \nHe also earned a certificate in project management in 2005. (Tr. at 36-40.) \nApplicant disclosed in his 2014 SCA that he had not filed his tax year (TY) 2011 \nstate tax return and that the state tax authority had issued a garnishment of his wages in \nthe amount of $5,900. He noted that he intended to file the return in April 2014, which \nwould result in the state releasing the garnishment. This disclosure and incident reports \nfiled by Applicant\u2019s employer regarding his state wage garnishments triggered a review \nby the Government of Applicant\u2019s tax filings and payments for the TYs 2009 through 2018. \n(Tr. at 42-44; GE 1 at 32-33; GE 4 at 9-12, 13-15, 16-26.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state tax returns for \nTYs 2009 through 2019 in a timely manner, as required.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g.) In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted all of these allegations except 1.g. The SOR sets forth two additional allegations. \nOne is for a debt in collection in an amount of about $9,759. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) The other is an \nallegation that he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1998 seeking to discharge about \n$196,258 in liabilities. (SOR \u00b6 1.i) Applicant denied these last two allegations in his \nAnswer. The specific facts regarding each of the allegations are as follows: \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth eight allegations under this \nconcern. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. The details regarding \neach of these allegations are as follows: \n1.a Failure to timely file Federal income taxes returns for TYs 2009-2019 \u2013 \nApplicant did not file his Federal income tax returns on time for TYs 2009 through 2019, \nas evidenced by the IRS transcripts in the record for TYs 2009 through 2018, and \nApplicant\u2019s registered mail receipt for his TY 2019 Federal return, which Applicant added \nto the record after the hearing as AE II. Applicant represented in his January 16, 2020 \ninterrogatory responses that his 2019 Federal tax return would be filed \u201cbefore April \n2020.\u201d His mail receipt reflects a mailing date for this return of May 17, 2021. Even after \nsubmitting his 2014 SCA, Applicant continued to file his Federal and state tax returns \nafter their due dates. Applicant maintained at the hearing that although he did not file his \nFederal income tax returns in a timely manner for each of these years, he never owed \nany taxes. He provided no IRS documents, however, confirming that assertion for the \nyears 2016 through 2019, even though he said he would after the hearing. He \nacknowledged receiving letters from the IRS over the years at issue regarding his failure \nto file his tax returns as required. After receiving the SOR in November 2020, Applicant \nfiled his TY 2020 Federal tax return on time. (Tr. at 42-44, 46-64, 69-79, 81-84, 91, 116; \nGE 4 at 9-12, 13-15, 16-27; AE E-N, AE II; AE JJ.) \nApplicant further testified that he received substantial refunds for each of the tax \nyears in question because he deliberately overwithheld on his taxes. The record reflects \nthat though he filed his returns three years after their due dates during the years involved, \nhe managed to file his returns in time to avoid losing his tax refunds under the Federal \nstatutory limitation for claiming income tax refunds. He testified that this timing was his \n\u201cMO,\u201d or modus operandi. (Tr. at 62.) Applicant testified that he filed three years late \nrather than on time because each year, it was not his \u201cpriority\u201d to file timely even though \nhe was delaying the receipt of his refund by three years. When he was about to be too \nlate to claim his refund, then the filing became a priority. Also, when he filed his returns \nand the IRS determined that he owed no additional taxes, the IRS would reverse the \ninterest and penalties it had imposed if it prepared a substitute return. (Tr. at 52-56, 67.) \n1.b Failure to timely file state income tax returns for TYs 2009-2019 \u2013 During \nthe 11 tax years in question, Applicant also filed his state income tax returns in an untimely \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanner. He filed his state tax returns at the same time as his Federal returns. All of his \nreturns during that period were filed late by about one or more years, typically three years \nlate. At the hearing, he submitted a document from his state tax authority indicating that \nhis 2019 return was filed on May 17, 2021, about one year late. The same exhibit reflects \nthat he timely filed his 2020 tax return in 2021, when the filing date was delayed to June \n15, 2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Applicant further testified that he only owed his \nstate any additional tax in one year, TY or 2016 or 2017.  He owed $493 more than the \ntaxes withheld from his paychecks. He received refunds in the other years. (Tr. at 45, 79-\n89; AE E; AE DD; AE HH; AE KK.) \n1.c 2009 state tax levy in the amount of about $4,883 for TY 2006 \u2013 Applicant\u2019s \nstate tax issues date back to TYs 2006 and 2007 when the state imposed liens for both \ntax years. In certain years when Applicant failed to file his tax returns on time, the state \nwould calculate his taxes without regard to his personal tax deductions, determine that \nhe owed additional taxes, and impose a tax lien. Applicant explained that the state would \nwithdraw the liens once he eventually filed his tax returns and the returns demonstrated \nthat he was owed a refund. Applicant provided a screenshot of a webpage of the state \ntax authority summarizing his tax account. The document reflects that he owes no taxes \nfor any of the tax years from 2010 to 2018. A similar document shows no taxes owed \nduring the period TYs 2011 through 2020. (Tr. at 81-82; GE 2 at 1-2; GE 4 at 30; AE A.) \n1.d 2009 state tax levy in the amount of about $6,967 for TY 2007 \u2013 See 1.c, \nabove. \n1.e 2013 state tax levy in the amount of about $5,997 for TY 2013 \u2013 See 1.c, \nabove. \n1.f 2017 state tax levy in the amount of about $11,296 for TY 2014 \u2013 See 1.c, \nabove. \n1.g 2018 state tax levy in the amount of about $6,982 \u2013 See 1.c, above. \n1.h Delinquent debt in collection in the amount of about $9,759 \u2013 This debt \narose from Applicant\u2019s use of a credit card to pay expenses related to his father\u2019s care in \nhis old age and the management of his home before and after his father\u2019s death. Applicant \nwas unable to pay the account, and it became delinquent. He testified that this debt arose \nat a time when he had children in college and had other expenses. He settled the debt in \nNovember 2017 with a lump-sum payment of $7,000. (Tr. at 92-98; GE 6 at 8; AE Z.) \n1.i 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition with debts of about $196,258 \u2013 \nApplicant testified that he became indebted at the time and could not pay his bills. The \nmain reason for his financial distress at the time was that he became responsible for child \nsupport for a child he had fathered in 1980. He first learned about the child when the \nchild\u2019s mother applied for welfare. He was notified that he had to provide child support of \nabout $500 per month. That financial obligation continued for about five years. He had \ntwo young children with his wife. His work was the family\u2019s only source of income.

He fully paid his child support obligations \nuntil the child reached the age of 18. (Tr. at 98-101; GE 5 at 25.) \nWhole-Person Evidence \nApplicant submitted evidence regarding the strength of his current financial \nposition. He has a high credit score, high six-figure retirement accounts, and significant \ncash reserves. He also has substantial equity in his residence and three investment \nproperties. (Answer at 2; AE B-D; AE BB; AE CC.) \nApplicant also submitted his two most recent employee performance reviews, \nwhich rate him as an excellent employee with significant technical knowledge. His many \nyears of experience in his industry has made him a valuable employee. He also provided \nevidence of his contributions to his local high school and as a mentor. (AE EE; AE FF; \nAE GG; AE LL.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria\nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his \ntestimony establish the following conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Six of these mitigating conditions have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his Federal and state \nincome tax returns as required by law occurred over an 11-year period ending with the \nfiling of his TY 2019 return a year late in 2021. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with this basic \nrule applicable to all taxpayers casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000) (A person who \nhas a history of not fulfilling their legal obligation to file income tax returns may be said \nnot to have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability required for access \nto classified information.)

See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, while very dated, adds to the evidence that \nApplicant cannot be viewed as someone who reliably honors his legal and financial \nobligations and can be trusted to protect classified information. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant did not establish that there was a reason \nfor his non-compliance with the tax laws over an 11-year period that was beyond his \ncontrol. His only explanation was that he had other priorities. It is significant that when the \ndeadline approached every year placing him at risk of forfeiting his refunds, filing his tax \nreturns became a priority and he made the time to file his returns and receive his refunds. \nThe condition that caused Applicant\u2019s delinquencies over an 11-year period was entirely \nwithin his control. Moreover, he did not act responsibly and in compliance with his legal \nobligation to file his tax returns in a timely manner. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant provided no evidence that he received any \nfinancial or tax counseling. If he had consulted a tax professional, he would have better \nunderstood that his \u201cmodus operandi\u201d of filing his tax returns before the expiration of the \nthree-year period allowed for claiming refunds is not an extension of his legal filing \ndeadline. See ISCR Case No. 18-00635 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019); ISCR Case No. 12-\n11375 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 17, 2016).  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. Applicant provided evidence that he has \nrepaid his one delinquent debt and that he has no other debts, aside from a home \nmortgage let alone any delinquent debt. His impressive financial condition, however, does \nnot mitigate the security concerns raised by his long history of non-compliance with his \nFederal and state tax filing obligations. His resolution of his multiple state tax liens by \nfiling untimely state tax returns cannot be considered a good-faith effort to resolve those \ndebts. Moreover, these state tax liens could have been completely avoided by timely \ncompliance with Applicant\u2019s state tax filing deadlines. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is only partially established. For 11 years, Applicant failed to file his tax \nreturns as required by law. The fact that he eventually filed his returns and owed no taxes \ndoes not mitigate the security concerns raised by his failure to comply with the law. The \nDirective cites failure to file returns as required as a disqualifying condition in and of itself, \nirrespective of whether the underlying taxes have actually been paid, as through \nwithholding.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a mature, highly educated, and well-compensated engineer employed by a \nmajor U.S. defense contractor. Starting in 2010, he exercised poor judgment in not \nprioritizing his legal obligation to file his Federal and state tax returns by the filing \ndeadlines. In prior years, he complied with the law, and he knew it was his obligation to \ndo so. Instead, he prioritized filing his returns within the time restriction for eligibility to \nreceive tax refunds from the IRS and his state tax authority. This is indicative of judgments \nbeing made in his self-interest alone and without regard to his legal obligations, which is \nantithetical to the values of reliability and trustworthiness required of an individual seeking \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in July 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2004 until \nhe has honorably discharged in May 2014.

(Tr. 6, 22-26; GE 1, 3) \nThe SOR alleged nine collection accounts and seven charged-off or past-due \ndebts (student loan, child support, credit cards, and consumer debts) totaling \napproximately $29,500. The debts are established by credit reports from March 2018, \nMay 2019, and November 2020; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with a \ndefense investigator in October 2018; and his SOR admissions. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p) (AE \n3, 5-7; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant explained that his financial distress began when he incurred some debts \nwhile still in the Army and after his divorce in 2012. He also was unemployed from \nSeptember 2016 to July 2017, which caused him to get behind on his debt payments. \nBefore his hearing, he contacted a bankruptcy attorney about possibly filing for \nbankruptcy protection, but at this point he has not pursued it beyond the initial contact. In \nJuly 2020, he hired a debt repair company (DRC) to clean up his credit report. He stated \nthat they did some positive work, but he believed he could do what the company was \ndoing without paying the fee. He was paying approximately $89 a month for this service. \nHe stopped in November 2020. (Tr. 25, 46; GE 3) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$10,782.

He described Applicant as a hard-working professional who provided mission \nsupport in a number of areas. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred multiple delinquent debts, of which all but one remain unpaid or \nunresolved. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and, although he successfully disputed one debt, he \nfailed to produce supporting documentation that he has addressed the remainder of his \ndebts. He failed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is \nunlikely. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and unemployment were circumstances beyond his control. \nHowever, he did not act responsibly by failing to engage his creditors in an attempt to \nresolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Additionally, he failed to put forth a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply. Applicant successfully disputed SOR \u00b6 1.c and AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to that debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his three deployments, his \ndecorations, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also \nconsidered that he has made insufficient efforts to resolve his debts. He has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to question \nhis ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix \nC, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.) \n7 \n\n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.d-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Department Counsel did not \nprovide a copy of the receipt Applicant claimed to have submitted with his Answer, and \ndiligent search of DOHA records did not produce any such receipt. However, the amount \nat issue in the three debts is incidental to the overall decision in this case. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old principal systems engineer employed by a U.S. defense \ncontractor since October 2014. He documents continuous employment in similar positions \nsince at least November 2009, but reports small breaks in employment when contracts \nended, and he had to find employment with a new contractor. He served honorably in the \nU.S. military from September 1994 to April 1999. He has twice married, and has two sons \nwith his first wife, and a step-child with his second wife. He held a clearance when he was \nin the military, but has never held an industrial clearance (Item 2). \nApplicant describes a lengthy history of financial pressures, beginning with his \n2009 divorce from his first wife. He experienced job loss due to reductions in force or \nfurloughs in 2012, 2013, and 2014, resulting in the foreclosure on his house (Item 2, 3; \nResponse). In addition to his divorce expenses, Applicant and his wife had child custody \nissues with her child between 2015 and 2017 (Response). His wife had medical issues in \n2018. Moreover, she has been unable to work in 2020 because of pandemic restrictions. \nApplicant=s Answer (Item 1) admitted the SOR allegations, but, except for the SOR \n1.f-1.g and 1.i medical debts, did not otherwise illuminate his financial situation. He \ndocumented no efforts to contact any of his creditors or to provide a current status of his \ndebts. He documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a budget. He \nprovided no work or character references, or evidence of community involvement. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. He experienced financial pressures \nbeginning in 2009, and accumulated significant delinquent debtCalbeit largely due to \ncircumstances beyond his control. Nevertheless, he documented no efforts to address \nthe bulk of his $10,000 delinquent debt.3 \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nindebtedness is multiple, recent, and ongoing. 4 Moreover, while Applicant can \ndemonstrate that his indebtedness was largely due to circumstances beyond his control, \nit is clear that he has not been responsible in addressing his debts.5 The three medical \ndebts Applicant claims to have addressed initially totaled $737, but, at best, have only \nbeen reduced to about $300 between January 2018 and August 2020. \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and he has not \ndocumented that the debts are being resolved.6 The absence of documentation means \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3&&9(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n4&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n5&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.7  \nMoreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might support a whole-\nperson assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his conduct.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might\nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in\nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the\ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge\nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control,\njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as\nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive\npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines\nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6 19(f). Discussion of this disqualifying \ncondition is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2014 \nthrough 2017 (filed in May 2020 after receipt of the SOR). He has no federal or state tax \ndebt. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information must nevertheless be denied. In ISCR Case No. \n15-1031 (App. Bd.

Nevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to \ngrant access to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant provided some important evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) \nbecause he has filed most of the overdue tax returns, and he did not owe any taxes to \nthe state and federal governments. However, under the DOHA Appeal Board \njurisprudence, this is too little, too late to mitigate security concerns. He did not prove that \nhe was unable to make greater progress sooner filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old system architect. He has been employed by the same \nDefense contractor since December 1996. In 1989, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nengineering. He has held a security clearance since July 1990. \nApplicant has ample financial resources to pay his debts, including his taxes. The \nonly area of financial irresponsibility is his history of failing to timely file his state and \nfederal income tax returns. I am confident that he will continue to diligently work to get his \ntax returns filed and that he will timely file his tax returns in the future. However, this is \ninsufficient to establish full mitigation at this time. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated\u201d). \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant owed less than $1,800 in \nfederal income taxes for those four TYs at the time of the decision. Id. The Appeal Board \nfound the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor stating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission\nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background\ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the\ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that\nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id.\nat 5. \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his state and federal income tax returns in the context of his \neligibility for access to classified information. He did not establish he was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner in the resolution of his tax issues. His actions under the Appeal \nBoard jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

He married in 2002 and divorced in 2009. He has two \nchildren from the marriage, ages 18 and 15. He remarried in 2015 and divorced in 2018. \nThere are no children from the marriage. He is a high school graduate and has earned \nsome college credits. In 1997, he enlisted in the military and served until his retirement in \nthe paygrade E-6 in 2017 with an honorable discharge. Applicant was unemployed from \nFebruary 2017 to April 2017 and from August 2017 until March 2018. He has been \nemployed by a federal contractor since March 2018. (Tr. 24-28; GE 1)  \nWhile in the military, Applicant served in the medical field and supervised other \nairmen. In 2016, he was the subject of a criminal investigation based on accusations by \nfemale patients that he unlawfully touched one patient\u2019s breast; unlawfully touched \nanother patient\u2019s buttocks, inner thighs, and pelvic area with his hands; and unlawfully \ntouched a third patient\u2019s breast and legs with his hands, violations of Article 128 of the \nUniform Code of Uniform Justice (UCMJ)-assault and battery. He was also investigated \nfor violations of Article 92 on divers occasions in 2015 for: knowing dereliction of duty for \nwillfully failing to use a chaperone during the exposure and examination of sensitive areas \nof the body of female patients, which was his duty to do; willfully failing to document \nmedical procedures, which was his duty to do; willfully failing to refrain from exceeding \nhis authorized roles and privileges, by accessing Electronic Protected Health Information \n(EPHI), in violation of DoD Instructions, as it was his duty to do; and willingly failing to \nwear disposable nonsterile gloves during physical contact as was his duty to do. (Tr. \n54GE 4) \n2 \n \nAfter completion of the investigation, in August 2016, Applicant was advised in \nwriting by his commander that he was considering whether Applicant should be punished \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat an UCMJ Article 15 nonjudicial punishment proceeding. Applicant was afforded a right \nto consult with a lawyer before making a decision and have the lawyer assist him \nthroughout the proceeding, and he was provided an appointment to meet with a lawyer. \nIn writing, Applicant acknowledged he consulted with a lawyer; waived his right to a court-\nmartial and accepted nonjudicial punishment; attached a written presentation; and \nrequested a personal appearance. As part of the written presentation, Applicant stated \nhe was accepting the Article 15, but was not admitting guilt. He was charged with three \nspecifications of violation of Article 128, assault and battery, and four specifications of \nviolation of Article 92, dereliction of duty, as detailed in the above paragraph. The \ncommander\u2019s findings noted that after considering all of the evidence, including any \nmatters Applicant presented, he found Applicant did not commit the Article 128 offenses, \nbut violated all the Article 92 offenses, except the failure to wear disposable gloves. The \ncommander imposed forfeitures of $1,860 pay per month for two months, suspended until \nDecember 2016, at which time it would be remitted; 20 days extra duty; and a reprimand. \n(Tr. 98-102 GE 4; AE A) \nThe written reprimand noted that, as a noncommissioned officer, Applicant\u2019s \nblatant disregard for failing to document outpatient evaluations and treatment and \naccessing EPHI without authorization was in violation of written instructions, which was \nunacceptable. He further stated that Applicant was responsible for those appointed under \nhis supervision to follow all written instructions, and he cannot be trusted to ensure others \nare following written instructions when he did not follow them. Applicant\u2019s actions \nseriously affected the trust placed in him by his supervisors and his unit. Applicant chose \nnot to appeal the commander\u2019s decision. The Article 15 was reviewed through the \nappropriate legal requirements. Applicant signed the document acknowledging he had \nbeen informed that the Article 15 would be filed in his service Unfavorable Information \nFile. (GE 4) \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in July \n2018. Section 15-Military History asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been subject to \ncourt-martial or other disciplinary procedure under the UCMJ, such as Article 15, \nCaptain\u2019s mast, Article 135 Court of Inquiry, etc.?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 1) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his failure to disclose his Article \n15 was due to an administrative oversight. He stated he was told by his attorney that: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI had won my case on the Article 15 but to the items I pleaded guilty to \n(subparagraphs a-c), I would be reprimanded by the command. In about \nAugust 2016, I was called in to the (sic) see commander and he \nreprimanded me and gave me the additional duty as punishment. It was my \nunderstanding that this was not a part of the Article 15 proceeding since I \nwas told that I won my case by my attorney, but rather a command directed \nLetter of Reprimand. Soon after my duties were complete, I retired in \nFebruary 2017. I never questioned the fact that the offenses were absorbed \nin the Article 15 until I was questioned by OPM investigator for not \nanswering correctly.

(Answer to \nSOR) \nApplicant told the government investigator that he did not disclose his Article 15 \non his SCA because he did not think he was required to do so, because he never received \nany article or forfeitures of pay because the investigation closed with no incident. (GE 2) \nApplicant reiterated his explanation at his hearing when he testified that he failed \nto disclose his Article 15 due to ignorance. He stated that after his hearing his lawyer \ncongratulated him on winning the case. His first sergeant reminded him that he was still \nbeing punished for the Article 92 violations. Applicant testified that he did not see the \nnonjudicial punishment forms and never saw the Article 92 offenses. Documents show \nApplicant signed the forms and that all of the charges were detailed in the forms. The \nArticle 128 specifications were crossed out as was the one Article 92 specification. The \nremaining three Article 92 specifications were not crossed out and were the offenses for \nwhich he was punished for committing. The reprimand by the commander also addressed \nhis violations of Article 92. Applicant testified that he completed his 20 days of extra duty, \nbut the forfeitures were not imposed. His commander suspended the forfeitures. (Tr. 38-\n44; GE 4) \nApplicant testified that he did not disclose his Article 15 on his SF 86 because he \nwas told by his commander that it would not remain on his record. Applicant believed it \nwas to last for two years, or be vacated, if separated, retired, or he changed permanent \nduty stations. His assumption was that because he was retired it would not be part of his \nrecord. He did not think the Article 15 existed anymore.

He testified, he assumed he \nwas being reprimanded for the other things that he did, but he didn\u2019t realize that was still \npart of the Article 15 paperwork. When asked what he thought he received 20 days of \nextra duties for, he stated for the Article 92 violations, but he did not think that was part \nof his Article 15 because he believed he won the case.

He stated many times there are things said between a doctor and a \nmedical technician that are not documented. He stated that he was taught to tell the doctor \nwhat he may have done, so they do not duplicate things. He admitted he failed to \ndocument certain things. (TR. 30-32; GE 4) \nApplicant pleaded guilty to accessing EPHI for himself, his wife, and his son \nagainst regulations.

(Tr. 120; AE \nC, D, E, K) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will\nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination,\nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national\nsecurity eligibility:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nI have considered all of the evidence and conclude that Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose on his SCA that he had a UCMJ Article 15 proceeding while on active duty. At \nhis Article 15 proceeding he was found guilty of dereliction of duty on divers occasions \nfor willfully failing to use a chaperone during the exposure and examination of sensitive \nareas of female patients; willfully failing to document medical procedures and willfully \nfailing to refrain from exceeding his authorized role and privileges, by accessing EPHI in \nviolation of DoD regulations. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated \nfully and truthfully;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nApplicant repeatedly violated regulations for medical personnel required to protect \nboth the provider and the patient. His response that it was common practice does not \nexcuse him from abiding by rules and regulations. His explanation that frequently female \nchaperones were unavailable, also does not bode well for failing to comply. Obviously \nregulations are in place for a reason and personnel that choose to abide by those that \nthey choose and ignore others that are inconvenient is seriously misguided and such \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nflouting defeats the purpose of having rules and regulations. Applicant was a senior \nexperienced medical technician who was cavalier in his attitude. Accessing medical \nrecords, regardless of who they belong to is a serious violation. Although, it is unlikely \nthat Applicant would make the same mistakes regarding complying with the specific \nregulations that are the basis of the allegations, I am not convinced that his behavior is \nunlikely to recur regarding other regulations that may be inconvenient. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s dereliction of duty violations. \nApplicant was an experienced medical technician with 19 years of service who had \nworked in supervisory roles. He was aware that he was being punished for violations of \nthe UCMJ after a lengthy investigation. He was given extra duties, a reprimand, and \nforfeitures that were suspended. It is disingenuous to believe that he did not realize this \nwas part of his Article 15. The documents support he was aware his conduct was being \npunished under this Article. In addition, his defense counsel may have told him that the \nmost serious offenses had been dismissed, so it was a \u201cwin,\u201d but the other violations \nremained. Applicant testified that he did not believe the Article 15 was part o\n f his record, \nso it was unlikely to be discovered. He also did not disclose that he had received a \nreprimand and disciplinary action in his SCA, which was not alleged, but corroborates \nthat he did not plan on disclosing the information because he did not believe there was a \nrecord. Looking for ways to circumvent disclosure requirements raises serious questions. \nThere is no evidence that he sought legal advice about whether this information should \nbe disclosed in his SCA. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has three delinquent debts that began accumulating in approximately \n2015. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment. His \nretirement pay is being garnished to repay the military credit card account (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nIn his answer to the SOR, he stated he would address the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.f for a \ndelinquent loan when he completed paying the military credit card. At his hearing, he \ntestified that he had made payments for four years and paid the loan in SOR \u00b6 2.f, which \nwent to judgment in 2017. These are contradictory statements. He was afforded an \nopportunity to provide some proof the debt is resolved. He did not submit any. Paying a \ndebt through an involuntary garnishment does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay \na creditor. Therefore, his debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. It has been three years since his \nunemployment. He failed to show he resolved his largest debt, and garnishment does not \nconstitute acting responsibly. I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt, regarding \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.e and find in his favor on this debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a document from a credit counseling service that shows he has \na budget and completed an online course. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application because \nthere is insufficient evidence that he has resolved his largest debt and that his financial \nproblems are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old veteran. Following rules and regulations while holding a \nsecurity clearance is critical. The government must be confident that those holding \nsecurity clearances comply with rules and regulations, even when they are inconvenient, \ntedious, or when no one is watching. Being able to rely on those with security clearances \nto use good judgment and be honest is the cornerstone of the process. Applicant has not \nmet his burden of persuasion. At this juncture, he has an unreliable financial track record. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline \nF, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He went into the box and stole \ncamera equipment. The unit that owned the box initially reported to the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS) that 37 cameras valued at about $20,000 were stolen. An \ninventory of the equipment disclosed that three cameras and nine lenses totaling about \n$3,438 were missing. (GE 2, 3, 10) \nApplicant attempted to sell a camera and a lens to another service member. He \nsent pictures of the equipment to the service member. A third service member found out \nabout it, and advised Applicant to return the equipment. Applicant admitted to other \nservice members that he took camera equipment home, but he had returned the \nequipment. (GE 3, 3, 10) \nApplicant waived his right to remain silent when he was questioned by the NCIS \nin November 2014. He lied and stated that he did not take the missing equipment, and \nhe did not attempt to sell it. He was questioned again in January 2015. He admitted that \nhe had not been truthful during the first interview. He stated that he \u201cwas scared and in \nflight mode during [his] first interview.\u201d He stated that he was \u201ca good Sailor and the \nthought of being in trouble frightened [him].\u201d He stated that he and a petty officer went \ninto the box, and the petty officer took about three to four cameras. The petty officer told \nhim that the cameras appeared to be from his previous unit and were not serialized, so \nthe Navy could not account for them. He told Applicant that he planned to use them as \nChristmas presents. Applicant stated that after seeing a petty officer take cameras, he \ndecided to take one also. He admitted that he took a camera and a lens home. (Tr. at \n35-37; GE 10) \nIn March 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 \nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violations of Articles 107 (false official \nstatement) and 121 (larceny and wrongful appropriation) of the UCMJ. He was reduced \none pay grade to E-3. (Tr. at 39; GE 1-3, 10) \nApplicant claims that he has accepted responsibility for his crimes, but he really \nhas not. In his January 2018 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he \nwrote \u201cI took a camera that was given to me when I found out it was stolen I returned \nthe item.\u201d During his background interview in January 2019, he stated that a supervisor \ntold him that the camera equipment had been purchased as surplus items. He stated \nthat he took the camera from the supervisor because he hoped to be assigned to the \nsupervisor\u2019s unit and did not want to create any strife with the supervisor.

Applicant told the investigator that he immediately went to his backpack and \nretrieved the camera. He told the investigator that he lied to NCIS because of a \u201cbro\ncode\u201d of protecting the supervisor from discipline because Applicant wanted to get into \nthe same unit. (GE 1, 2) \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided similar testimony at his hearing. He stated that he did not \nrealize it was stealing or a crime when he took the camera. (Tr. at 34-45, 99-108) I did \nnot find any of his testimony credible. I find that he stole at least one camera and a lens, \nlied about it to the NCIS, and continued to lie about it up to and during his security \nclearance hearing. \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor in Iraq from about August 2017 to \nDecember 2017. His employer at the time filed an incident report on the Joint Personnel \nAdjudication System (JPAS) that stated that Applicant \u201cabandoned his job site . . . \nwithout notification of chain of command,\u201d and caused the site to drop below \u201ccontract \nminimum operating requirements and placed warfighters at risk.\u201d Applicant wrote in his \n2018 SF 86 that he left the job \u201cdue to management\u2019s poor ability to handle \nconfrontation on the site.\u201d He stated in his background interview that his supervisor \ncreated a hostile work environment. Applicant testified that his request to move to \nanother site in November 2017 was disapproved. He was told if he did not like the site, \nhe should quit, which he did. The company wanted Applicant to return to the United \nStates to out-process, but Applicant refused because he wanted to stay in Iraq and work \nfor another contractor. He provided statements from individuals who shared his negative \nview of the company. (Tr. at 45-66, 109-122, 131-133; GE 1-4; AE I-M) \nApplicant was hired by another defense contractor in Iraq the day after he left the \njob site of his previous employer. He worked for the company in Iraq from December \n2017 to March 2018, and from May 2018 until he was sent home early in June 2018 for \nleaving the base without following proper protocol and poor performance. His \nemployment was terminated a few days later in the United States. Applicant denied any \nmisconduct. He stated that he complied with all of the regulations regarding leaving the \nbase. (Tr. at 66-82, 122-129; GE 2, 5) \nThe delinquent debts in the SOR were based on credit reports obtained in May \n2018, March 2019, and November 2019. Applicant attributed his financial problems to \nmismanagement of his finances by his ex-wife while he was working overseas. He \nstated that she opened accounts without his knowledge. He testified that the charged-\noff credit union debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f is the only debt in the SOR that he took out \nhimself. He also stated that divorce, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the birth of his child \nadversely affected his finances. He contracted with a credit-repair company in June \n2019 to assist him in disputing inaccurate items on his credit report.

The credit union reported in June 2021 \nthat Applicant was in compliance with the agreement; he had paid a total of $450; and \nthe remaining balance was $3,938.

The credit reports list the last payment was received on the \naccount in April 2014. The debt is not listed on the November 2020 credit report. The \ndebt was past the seven-year reporting window, so it should not be listed on the report \nregardless of whether it was disputed. (Tr. at 31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6-9; \nAE O) \nIn June 2021, Applicant used a credit card to pay a $1,197 debt that was not \nalleged in the SOR. He stated that his finances have stabilized. He admitted that he \nowed about $4,600 to the IRS for income taxes for tax year 2019.1 (Tr. at 31-32, 96-98, \n136-139; AE G, H) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his professionalism, \npatriotism, dedication, work ethic, compassion, reliability, trustworthiness, loyalty, \nintegrity, and ability to follow rules and regulations. (AE K-N) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n1 Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes were not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will \nnot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and under the whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, o\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also b\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. A\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nr \n \n \ne \n \n \nn \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to mismanagement of his finances by \nhis ex-wife while he was working overseas, and that she opened accounts without his \nknowledge. His testimony that the charged-off credit union debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f is \nthe only debt in the SOR that he took out himself is countered by his previous \nstatements that he was responsible for a number of the SOR debts. He stated that \ndivorce, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the birth of his child also adversely his finances. \nHe commented in his January 2018 SF 86: \u201cI originally was not smart with my money \n[and] spent money I did not have.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is credited with paying the $566, $389, $492, and $504 debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.h, and 2.i. He has a payment agreement for the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.f. Those \nallegations are mitigated. The unidentified medical debt in SOR \u00b6 2.d is also mitigated. \nI am satisfied that the remaining debts, even if they no longer appear on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, are his debts, and they are not paid. I also note that he has \nunpaid federal taxes from tax year 2019. There is insufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he \nmade a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nnot mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal offenses in the military and his workplace misconduct reflect \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. His \nconduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) \nis applicable. AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable to the workplace misconduct. Applicant\u2019s false \nstatement to NCIS established AG \u00b6 16(b). AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable to the \nfalse statement and the larceny of the camera equipment because that conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, \nthe general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant accepted only limited responsibility for his crimes in the military and \nvirtually no responsibility for his conduct in Iraq. I did not find any of his testimony \ncredible. He lied to the NCIS, and he has continued to lie up to and during his security \nclearance hearing. \nI cannot find with any certainty that Applicant\u2019s problematic behavior will not \nrecur. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and honorable discharge. However, that is \ninsufficient to overcome his ongoing financial problems and problematic conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.h-2.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.j-2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In subsequent years, their AGI was much lower, ranging from $205,725 in 2013, to $146,620 in 2018. During TYs 2012 through 2014, the couple under withheld on their incomes in significant amounts and incurred substantial federal tax liabilities.

Based \nupon a review of the pleadings and the documentary evidence in the record, national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 1, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nThe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 7, 2020, detailing national security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The DoD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective within the Department of Defense on \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn March 30, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (Answer).

In her \nAnswer, she asserted that the nine delinquent debts alleged in the SOR had all been \nsettled and paid. She also attached to her Answer six documents, which I have marked \nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. \nOn November 5, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included nine documents identified as \nItems 1-9. The FORM and the nine attachments were provided to Applicant, which she \nreceived on December 2, 2020. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to \nsubmit a written response and documents within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM. She \nprovided no response. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 28, 2021.

The transcripts reflect that she and her \nhusband had a joint adjusted gross income (AGI) in tax year (TY) 2012 of over $319,000. \nIn subsequent years, their AGI was much lower, ranging from $205,725 in 2013, to \n$146,620 in 2018. During TYs 2012 through 2014, the couple under withheld on their \nincomes in significant amounts and incurred substantial federal tax liabilities. The SOR \nalleges that the liabilities were: \u00b6 1.a - $13,879 (TY 2012), \u00b6 1.b - $19,192 (TY 2013), and \n\u00b6 1.c - $25,314 (TY 2014). The SOR also alleges tax liabilities of \u00b6 1.d - $564 (TY 2016), \n\u00b6 1.e - $4,896 (TY 2017), and \u00b6 1.f - $14 (TY 2018). The record reflects that Applicant \npaid all of her taxes due for TY 2015 at the time she filed her taxes, so the SOR contains \nno allegation regarding that tax year. Applicant\u2019s total federal tax liability during the six \ntax years alleged in the SOR was about $64,000. (GE 4.) \nThe SOR also alleges a credit-card debt that was charged off in the amount of \n$5,546 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and a past-due amount of $746 on a credit card with a balance of \n$3,487 (SOR \u00b6 1.h).

Their federal tax liability however, has not significantly decreased due to \ninterest accruing on their debt. In her Answer, Applicant asserted that on March 3 and 5, \n2020, about one month after the date of the SOR, she paid the IRS about $64,227 to \nsettle her tax liabilities for TY 2012 through 2014 and 2016. The specific amounts paid \nfor each year were as follows: \u00b6 1.a - $12,677 (TY 2012), \u00b6 1.b - $19,671 (TY 2013), \u00b6 \n1.c - $25,943 (TY 2014) and \u00b61.d - $6,936 (TY 2016). (GE 4; AE A through D.) \nApplicant also wrote in her Answer that her tax debt for TY 2017 was fully paid \n\u201cthat same year\u201d as was her small debt for TY 2018. The July 25, 2019 tax transcript for \nTY 2017 does not reflect that payment. With her Answer, she provided evidence from the \nIRS showing her payments for TY 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016, but nothing for TYs 2017 \nand 2018. Applicant\u2019s evidence regarding the debt of $4,896 for TY 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) is \nincomplete. The TY 2018 debt of $14 (SOR 1.f) is immaterial. \nApplicant also provided with her Answer evidence that she had completed paying \na settlement of her credit-card debt with Bank A (SOR \u00b6 1.g). The bank sent her a letter \ndated March 22, 2020, reflecting a settlement and a payment of $3,328. With respect to \nher credit-card delinquency on an account with Bank B (SOR \u00b6 1.h), Applicant wrote in \nher Answer that she had paid the account balance of $3,487 in full on March 18, 2020. \nShe commented that she had requested that the bank provide her with a letter confirming \nthe payment, but she had not received the letter at the time she submitted her Answer. \nInstead, she provided a copy of a page from her bank statement showing a payment to a \ncollection agency in the amount of $3,487, which is the amount of the balance due on the \naccount according to the SOR allegation. \nLastly, with respect to SOR allegation 1.i of a medical debt in the amount of $59, \nApplicant wrote in her Answer that \u201call medical payments were paid in full.\u201d She provided \nno documentation with respect to the particular medical bill alleged in the SOR. The most \nrecent credit report in the record, dated November, 2, 2020, does not reflect that this 2017 \ndebt has been paid. Aside from a relatively small auto loan balance, Applicant has minimal \nbalances on a few active accounts. She and her husband have lived in rental homes \nthroughout their marriage. (Answer at 1; GE 8 at 1-6.) \nSince neither party asked for a hearing in this case, the record contains limited \ninformation as to why Applicant incurred large tax liabilities during the period 2012 to 2014 \nand again in 2016 and 2017. The record does reflect that Applicant had a state tax \nliabilities of about $8,000 in TY 2004 and federal and state tax liabilities of over $40,000 \nin TY 2005. Also, Applicant had significant tax liabilities to her state tax authority for tax \nyears prior to 2016. The state issued a wage garnishment against Applicant in 2016. None \nof those debts are alleged in the SOR. (GE 2 at 33-35; GE 3 at 30, 33; GE 9.) \nThe record is silent of the status of Applicant\u2019s tax status in 2019 and 2020, though \nher behavior in 2015, 2016, and 2018 shows that she acted much more responsibly in \nrecent years than she had in the prior years when the couple\u2019s joint AGI was higher.

I note that the tax transcripts for TYs 2016 through 2018 list that \nApplicant had a significant amount of dividend income, which reflects that she and her \nhusband had substantial stock investments. (Answer at 1.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Answer and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Three of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe record evidence establishes the above mitigating conditions. Although \nApplicant\u2019s (and her husband\u2019s) mishandling of her tax liabilities despite her family\u2019s \nsignificant income was frequent in the tax years prior to 2014, she has been more \nresponsible in recent years. Her payment of all of her past-due tax liabilities last year for \nTY 2012 through 2014 and 2016 supports the conclusions that her behavior is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The absence of any documentary evidence regarding the status of her tax \nliability in 2017 is concerning. Also the fact that she waited until receiving the SOR to \ninitiate repayments of her tax liabilities and unpaid creditors undercuts the good-faith \nnature of her mitigation evidence. On the other hand, she has provided documentary \nevidence that she has fully paid four past years with tax delinquencies in the total amount \nof about $64,000 and two credit-card debts with payments totaling $6,800. There is no \nevidence in the record to suggest that she continued to incur any tax liabilities after TY \n2017 or other material debts. In light of the record as a whole, security concerns under \nSOR paragraph 1 are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me without any questions or doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her indebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. at 18-22; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file her 2015 through 2018 federal income tax returns when \nthey were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. Applicant was unemployed in 2014. It has not \nbeen established that she was required to file a federal income tax return for tax year \n2014. The part of SOR \u00b6 1.a that alleges Applicant did not file her 2014 federal income \ntax return is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant went through an extraordinary amount of issues in 2014 and 2015. She \nstated in 2017, 2019, and 2020 that she planned to file the returns, but they are still not \nfiled. While I sympathize with Applicant\u2019s problems, all I have from her are unfulfilled \npromises. I have no confidence that the returns will be filed in the foreseeable future. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). There are no applicable mitigating conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for tax \nyear 2014) \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 18, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR in September 2020 (undated) and requested a \nhearing.

At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits (GEs 1-4). Applicant relied on 17 exhibits \n(A-Q) and four witnesses (including himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nJanuary 27, 2021. \nBefore the close of the proceedings, Applicant asked to leave the record open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with about his wife\u2019s TSP retirement \naccount and progress on the remaining amounts owing on his student loans. For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record. The \nGovernment was afforded seven days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant \nprovided a letter from his wife detailing their payments on the debts covered by the \nSOR as well as their payoffs of the two remaining student debts owed: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.h. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted as AEs R-S without objections for \nconsideration. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated nine delinquent debts (all \nbut two, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i) representing delinquent student loans. Allegedly, these \ndebts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all but one (SOR \u00b6 1.f) of the \nGuideline F allegations covering his debts with explanations. He claimed his private \nstudent loans were covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c were paid through a settlement \nagreement in September 2017. He claimed that his brother and co-borrrower of the \nstudent loan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d was paid through a settlement agreement with a \ncollection agency, pursuant to which he continues to make $25 monthly payments. \nWhile admitting to being a co-borrower on the loan, Applicant claimed to be working \nwith his brother to either pay off the loan or otherwise resolve his co-borrowing \nobligation. Admitting the delinquent debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f, he claimed to be \nmaking regular monthly payments on this loan and has reduced the principal balance to \n$3,982. He further claimed the student loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are in \ncurrent status. And, he claimed the medical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.i is paid in full. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old wireless network engineer for a defense contractor \nwho seeks a security clearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 19) \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1997, and he served 10 months of \nactive duty (July 2997 through May 1998) before receiving a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions in May 1998. (GE 1) \nSince August 2017, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. (GE 1 \nand AE E; Tr. 19-22, 36-37) He reported periods of unemployment between February \n2017 and August 2017 and between May 2002 and August 2004. (GE 1) Previously, he \nwas employed by other contractors and making $150,000 a year. (GE 1; Tr. 21-22) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is employed by the DoD.

(AE R; Tr. 19-20) Prior to losing his job, he and his wife purchased a home \nfor their family and three children. (AE Q) During his seven months of unemployment, \nhe could not afford to cover the student loans he co-signed with his brother. \nBetween August 2003 and February 2008, Applicant took out seven different \nstudent loans that were guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DoE). (GEs \n2-4) These loans exceeded $80,000 and were used to finance Applicant\u2019s college \neducation classes. Credit reports document that these loans became delinquent in 2017 \nand were charged off in 2019. (GE 3) \nBesides his student loans, Applicant accumulated delinquent debts with two \nother creditors listed in the SOR. These debts are covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f (a credit card \ndebt  for $4,192) and SOR debt \u00b6 1.i (a medical debt for $26). (GEs 2-3) \nSince returning to full-time employment, Applicant has addressed each of his \nSOR debts. He documented payoffs of SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($623) and 1.h ($510) with \ntwo payments of $404.67 and $324.65, respectively, leaving current balances of roughly \n$320 with SOR creditor 1.g and a virtually zero balance with SOR creditor 1.h (AEs O-P \nand S; Tr. 21-22. 35-36, 63-65 Applicant also validated his 2019 payoffs of his \nremaining student loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e with loans from his wife\u2019s \nGovernment-funded TSP retirement accounts and help from his brother on one of his \nco-signed loans. (AE K; Tr. 63-67) On this latter loan, Applicant and his wife continue to \nmonitor his brother\u2019s payments.

(AE D) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                  \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n  Burdens of Proof \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n     \n \n \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1.  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. \n \n Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \nAnalysis \n \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts \n(mostly related to student loans). Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (both \nstudent loans and consumer accounts) warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nEach of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debts negate the need for any independent proof. See \nDirective 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His \nadmitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create some initial judgment \nissues. See ISCR case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24 2004). \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

Application of mitigating condition (MC) 20(b), \n\u201c\u201dthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the  person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss  of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d fully applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. Once he returned to full time \nemployment, he addressed all of his delinquent accounts and either payed them off or \nentered into payment arrangements that he has continued to honor with regular monthly \npayments, while monitoring his brother\u2019s payments on the student loan his brother co-\nsigned for. With his payment history, Applicant may also claim the mitigating benefits of \nMC \u00b6 20(d), \u201c the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \n \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, he has addressed all of his debt delinquencies covered \nby the SOR. Most of the debts he has paid in full. With the remaining creditors he has \nsettlement agreements in place that are in compliance with the payment terms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with his delinquent student loans and other \ndebts have since either been paid off or are paid in accordance with payment \nagreements. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Applicant is entitled to credit for his military and civilian \ncontributions to the DoD and defense industry, respectively. His initiated repayment of \nthe debts covered by the SOR, when combined with his military and civilian \ncontributions, are enough at this time to overcome his past account delinquencies \n(mostly with his student loans) and restore his finances to current status. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

(Item 1 at 16) \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application, completed in February 2013, contained \nthe following question: \nSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven years, \nhave you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? \nApplicant answered \u201cno,\u201d failing to disclose his marijuana use from 2004 to 2007. (Item 1 at \n3) SOR subparagraph 2.a alleges that this omission constitutes a falsification.  \nDuring an interview with an investigative agent in April 2013, Applicant, when asked \nif he had ever used marijuana in the past seven years, answered affirmatively, stating that \nhe used it in approximately fall 2006. (Item 6 at 9) SOR subparagraph 2.b alleges that his \nfailure to disclose use in 2004, 2005, and 2007, constitutes a falsification. \nApplicant contends that his 2013 security clearance omission and his underreporting \nof his marijuana use in the mid-2000s were unintentional oversights.

Applicant admits that he did not \ninclude the December 2018 use on the 2019 security clearance application, as alleged in \nthe SOR.

(Item 6 at 5) SOR subparagraph 2.d alleges that \nthis omission constituted a falsification. Applicant admits that he did not disclose this \nmarijuana use during the 2019 interview; however, he explained that he believed that the \nagent was only asking him about use within a seven-year scope of the date of the \ninterview. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant had disclosed his marijuana use from 2004 to 2007 during \nan investigative process in 2010.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement are set forth in AG \u00b6 24, as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nApplicant used marijuana approximately 12 times from 2004 to 2018. During some \nof this period of use, he held a security clearance. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position,\u201d apply. \nApplicant expressed an intention never to use marijuana in the future. He \nmemorialized this intention in a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement in the future. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \u201c providing a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility,\u201d applies. \nApplicant has promised to quit using marijuana twice before. On both occasions, he \nresumed marijuana use. Under these circumstances, the application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) has \nminimal probative value. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred over a 14-year time period, it was \ninfrequent. However, its nature and seriousness were significant because some of the use \noccurred after he was granted a security clearance. I conclude that the nature and \nseriousness of the use combined with his repeated broken promises to stop using \nmarijuana outweigh any positive security inference generated by the infrequency of use, \nand his signed sworn statement to discontinue use. Applicant has failed to mitigate the \ndrug involvement security concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n5 \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \n\n \n \n \nApplicant omitted his marijuana use 2004 to 2007 on his security clearance \napplication in February 2013, as alleged in subparagraph 2.a. In light of his disclosure of \nthis drug use on an earlier security clearance application in 2010, I find credible his \nexplanation that it was an unintentional oversight. I resolve subparagraph 2.a in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s explanations for underreporting his marijuana use during 2013 \nand 2019 interviews are credible in light of the 2010 disclosure. I resolve subparagraphs \n2.b and 2.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. In sum, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s responses on various \nsecurity clearance applications and interviews were due in part to a misunderstanding \nabout what was required, and as such, were inattentive, but not duplicitous. Applicant has \nmitigated the personal conduct security concern. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant is an outstanding worker in addition to a civic-minded individual who \nactively volunteers in the community and helps his neighbors. However, these positive \nattributes are insufficient to outweigh the negative security inference generated by the \nrecurrent use of marijuana, including after being granted a security clearance, and the \nrecency of his last use. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person \nconcept, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",
