    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old aircraft mechanic employed by a defense contractor and assigned overseas. He has worked for his current employer since August 2006. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant started his own aircraft repair business in the summer of 2000. His business declined substantially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Applicant used personal funds and credit card accounts in an unsuccessful effort to keep the business running (Tr. 33-35). The business failed in August 2006. Applicant started working for his current employer shortly after the business failed. He deployed overseas to a combat zone three times, and he was able to save enough money to pay off his delinquent debts (Tr. 35-38).

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 3, 2007. On \nDecember 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns based on financial considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 9, 2009; answered it on February 20, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nAugust 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on March 16, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 6, 2009, \nand the case was assigned to me on the next day. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nMay 21, 2009, scheduling the hearing by video teleconference for June 9, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through G, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record \nopen to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He submitted AX \nH on June 10, 2009. The record closed upon receipt of AX H. Department Counsel\u2019s \ncomments concerning AX H are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on June 15, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old aircraft mechanic employed by a defense contractor \nand assigned overseas. He has worked for his current employer since August 2006. He \nhas never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant started his own aircraft repair business in the summer of 2000. His \nbusiness declined substantially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \nApplicant used personal funds and credit card accounts in an unsuccessful effort to \nkeep the business running (Tr. 33-35). The business failed in August 2006.  \n \nApplicant started working for his current employer shortly after the business \nfailed. He deployed overseas to a combat zone three times, and he was able to save \nenough money to pay off his delinquent debts (Tr. 35-38). He has about $26,000 in \nsavings and $7,500 in investments (Tr. 46). \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nDental bill \n$1,563 \nPaid \nAX B; AX G at 3 \n1.b \nBusiness equipment $1,208 \nSettled \nAX D; AX G at 4 \n1.c \nCredit card \n$4,078 \nSettled \nAX E; AX G at 5-6 \n1.d \nCredit card \n$1,619 \nSettled \nAX C; AX G at 7-8 \n1.e \nAuto loan \n$5,461 \nPayment agreement\nAnswer at 9-14; AX H \n1.f \nBad check \n$640 \nPaid \nAX F; AX G at 15-16 \n1.g \nRental car \n$340 \nPaid \nAX G at 17 \n1.h \nCollection \n$766 \nPaid \nAX G at 18 \n1.i \nUtility bill \n$613 \nPaid \nAX G at 19 \n \n \nThe delinquent auto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e occurred after Applicant co-signed \nwith his mother to purchase an automobile for her. His mother failed to make the \n\n \n3 \n \n \npayments and the auto was repossessed. Applicant, who was deployed in a combat \nzone at the time, made telephonic arrangements with the creditor to start making \nmonthly payments on the debt. He paid $123 per month from May to October 2008, \nwhen he was informed by the creditor that they had no record of his account and no \nrecord of his payments (Tr. 44). At the time of the hearing, he was still corresponding \nwith the creditor in an effort to locate his account and resolve the debt (AX H).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a chief warrant officer (CW4), has known him for about a \nyear and described him as talented, dependable, responsible, honest, and courteous. \nThe chief warrant officer has worked with Applicant while deployed overseas in a \ncombat environment, and he rates Applicant among the top 5% of the contractor \nemployees he has supervised (AX A).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises these three disqualifying conditions, shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts were numerous and are not yet fully resolved. However, recurrence is unlikely \nbecause his debts occurred as a result of the business downturn following the events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and he is no longer involved in running a private business. His \nmethodical and conscientious resolution of all but one debt dispels any doubt about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Based on the above discussion of AG \u00b6 20(a), I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) also is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. This mitigating condition \nis established because Applicant\u2019s debts are being resolved. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case \nNo. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has methodically \nresolved all but one of his delinquent debts, and he is actively working to resolve his \none remaining debt. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n6 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult, with a reputation as a dependable, responsible, and \nhonest person. He has rebounded from the failure of his business, resolved all but one \nof his delinquent debts, and is actively working to resolve the one remaining debt. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns based on his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOHA timely received the hearing\nrequest. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 24, 2009, and I received\nthe case assignment on July 28, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 4,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 26, 2009. The government\noffered eight exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted nine\nexhibits (AE) A through I, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 3, 2009. I\nheld the record open until September 15, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional\nmatters. On September 14, 2009, he submitted eight additional exhibits, AE J through\nAE Q, without objection. The record closed on September 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and\n1.d-1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c,\nand 1.h of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for\n1\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 34 years old, works as a production manager for a Department\nof Defense contractor. He began this position in October 2008 after relocating from\nanother state. The record contains no evidence that shows he mishandled classified\ninformation or that he has performance issues at work.2\nApplicant married in 1998. He has three children, ages 12, 8, and 7 from his\nmarriage. He and his wife divorced in June 2008. His children live many miles from him,\nwith his former wife and her new husband.  \n3\nUntil 2004, Applicant managed his finances well. In 2004, a major hurricane\nseriously damaged his home. The damage included loss of his roof and significant\nwater damage, requiring he and his family to live in a hotel for at least a month. His\nhomeowner\u2019s insurance paid for all repairs in excess of Applicant\u2019s nine percent\ndeductible.

When they were doing the repairs, he and his\nwife decided to do some improvements to the property.  \n5\nApplicant worked for a company for eight years. During his tenure of\nemployment, the company promoted him from employee to supervisor, to quality\nassurance manager, to senior director and project manager, and finally, to vice\npresident in 2005. In March 2005, his company experienced a reduction in business,\nwhich resulted in reduced hours for all employees and managers. Applicant\u2019s work\nhours and income declined by 20%. This work and income reduction lasted three\nmonths. Applicant used his remaining savings to pay his bills.6\nIn November 2005, his company again experienced a decline in business, which\nlasted at least 10 months. They company reduced his, and all employees, hours and\npay by 20%. As an officer, the company further reduced his pay by another 10%. He\nused his 401k assets to pay his bills. Applicant resigned his position in August 2006\nbecause he was unsure if his job would continue. He accepted another, more stable\nposition at a lower salary. In November 2006, he obtained a part-time job delivering\npizzas to help with his finances. He also contacted debt consolidation firms to help him\nmanage his debt problems, but all declined to help.  \n7\nIn January 2007, he and his former wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an\neffort to stabilize their monthly expenses and resolve their debts. He reported this\ndecision to the facility security officer at his employment. Under the court approved\npayment plan, Applicant paid $3,180 a month on his debts. He made his bankruptcy\npayments until July 2007, when he received notice that his monthly mortgage payment\nwould increase several hundred dollars. At this time, he learned that the monthly\nbankruptcy payment would also increase by the same amount. He mistakenly believed\nthat when he filed bankruptcy, his adjustable rate mortgage could not change, and thus,\nhis monthly payment would not increase. When he realized that his monthly bankruptcy\npayment would increase, he sought advice from his bankruptcy attorney. He then\ndecided to have his case dismissed. He did not realize that the dismissal would be for\nnon-payment.8\nBy the summer 2007, Applicant\u2019s former wife agreed to seek help because of her\nalcohol consumption. Her drinking impacted his work, as he needed to leave work to\ncare for their children, even though his wife did not work. Qualified physicians\ndiagnosed her as alcohol dependent. She entered a treatment program in July 2007\n\nResponse to SOR and attachment; Tr. 38, 47.\n9\nResponse to SOR and attachments. \n10\nResponse to SOR and attachments; Tr. 46.\n11\nTr. 27, 39-41.\n12\nResponse to SOR; AE A-AE F; AE P.\n13\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated August 28, 2007); GE 5 (Credit report, dated September 24, 2008); GE 7 (Credit\n14\nreport, dated December 4, 2008); GE 9 (Credit report, dated August 25, 2009); AE K (Credit reports, dated\nMay 11, 2009 and August 25, 2009).\n4\nand has remained sober. Applicant estimated her alcohol consumption cost at least\n$300 a month, which contributed to his financial problems.  \n9\nFollowing the dismissal of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant retained the\nservices of a debt consolidation firm on September 26, 2007. He also worked with his\nmortgage company to resolve his debt issues and to stop any foreclosure proceedings.\nIn November 2007, he and his family moved out of their house into a rented town\nhouse. On December 5, 2007, his mortgage company filed a line of satisfaction of\nmortgage with the state court. The mortgage company agreed that his mortgage debt\nhad been paid in full.10\nHis wife asked for a divorce in February 2008. Although he learned that she was\ninvolved with another man, he worked to reach a fair resolution of their issues. Their\ndivorce became final in June 2008. His children live with her and visit him, when he can\npay for the plane tickets. He understood that he would be responsible for joint debts\nincurred in his marriage, but not his wife\u2019s sole debts. The creditors and collection\ncompanies for his wife sole accounts are seeking reimbursement from him for her debts\nincurred while they were married. His former wife does not work.11\nApplicant accepted a job offer from his current employer and moved from where\nhe lived to another state many miles away in October 2008. He received a $5,000\nsalary increase with his new position, which is offset by a higher cost of living. He stays\nin contact with his children, but he sees them infrequently because it is expensive to\ntravel.12\nApplicant currently earns $6,731 a month in gross income and $4,651 a month in\nnet income. His monthly expenses average $4,410 and include rent, utilities,\ntransportation costs, a school loan, and child support. He has a remainder of $240 each\nmonth. Applicant verified that he pays his current monthly bills.13\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated August 28, 2007; September 24, 2008;\nDecember 4, 2008; May 11, 2009; August 25, 2009; and the SOR, I have compiled a list\nof the total debts owed, excluding any duplicate entries. I find that Appellant\u2019s actual\ndebts are as follows:14\n\nOf the five credit reports in the record, this debt appears only on the credit report dated September 24, 2008.\n15\nSee GE 5.\nApplicant believed this debt belonged to his former wife. In her letter of July 11, 1008, his former wife lists\n16\nan account with this creditor and an account number. His former wife\u2019s account number does not match the\naccount number of a debt with this creditor listed on Applicant\u2019s May 11, 2009.

The firm refused to include all his overdue debts in\ntheir repayment plan. He paid this company $3,000 in servicing fees.  \n17\nAt the hearing, Applicant discussed to two different creditors that may have held\nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He believed these creditors purchased this debt at\ndifferent times. Because he experienced difficulty determining who owned these debts,\nhe made two payments of $200 each to each of the collection agents in October and\nNovember 2008 on accounts not listed in the SOR and not resolved. The account\nnumbers on his checks do not match the account numbers in the credit reports. While\nthese accounts and the account in allegation 1.d may be the same, the evidence of\nrecord does not indicate the accounts are the same. These two creditors refused to\ndevelop a repayment plan with him. Applicant has filed a dispute for one of these\ndebts.18\n\nAE Q; Tr. 80.\n19\nAE J; Tr. 90-93.\n20\n6\nSubsequent to the hearing, Applicant contacted and retained a bankruptcy\nattorney, instead of a debt consolidation firm. With the help of counsel, Applicant plans\nto file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. As required by the bankruptcy court, Applicant\nparticipated in debt counseling. He also underwent debt counseling during his previous\nbankruptcy filing and with the debt consolidation firm.19\nA co-worker and friend testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has known Applicant\nfor 10 years. As he was the facility security officer, the witness verified that Applicant\ndiscussed the reporting requirements for finances and his clearance in 2006 and that an\nincident report was filed related to Applicant\u2019s first bankruptcy. He verified the hurricane\ndamage to Applicant\u2019s home. He testified that Applicant lives a much more meager\nlifestyle and lives within his financial means. Applicant is extremely honest and hard\nworking. He does an outstanding job. Other co-workers agree with this assessment of\nApplicant. His former wife and her husband also wrote a letter of recommendation on\nhis behalf.20\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\n\n7\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and has unable to pay his\nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries\nstarted in 2004 when a hurricane damaged his home, and by 2006, his financial\n\n8\nproblems were severe. His finances continued to deteriorate until 2008. Because of the\nbusiness downturn, hurricane, alcoholic wife, and divorce, I find that this mitigating\ncondition is not applicable because these problems are recent and ongoing. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems started in 2004 when a hurricane damaged his home. Because he had a nine\npercent deductible, he paid a significant amount in repairs, using a bank credit line and\nhis savings. Six months after the storm damage, his employer reduced his work hours\nand income by 20% for three months due to a business downturn. He used his\nremaining savings to pay his bills. Five months after he returned to work full-time, his\nemployer again reduced his work hour by 20% and his income by 30%, as he was an\nofficer. Applicant began to fall behind in his bills and unsuccessfully attempted to hire a\ndebt consolidation firm. In an effort to manage his finances and save his home from\nforeclosure, he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He complied with the repayment\nterms until his mortgage payment increased significantly. After the bankruptcy case was\ndismissed, he worked with his mortgage company and resolved his mortgage debt. His\nwife\u2019s excessive monthly spending on alcohol impacted his ability to pay his debts until\nthe summer of 2007. In 2008, his wife asked for a divorce. Their divorce became final in\nJune 2008. When he first encountered financial problems, he used his savings, a bank\nloan and retirement funds to resolve his debt issues. In doing so, he acted reasonably.\nHowever, his problems, financial or otherwise, continue. Because Applicant has\nsignificant, unpaid bills and has had ample time to develop a plan to resolve his debts,\nthis mitigating condition cannot be fully applied at this time. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has been through debt counseling\nthree times and hired a debt consolidation company to help him with his debts. The debt\nconsolidation company would not work with many of his creditors, so his has\ndiscontinued his services with this company. He established that the debt in SOR\nallegation 1.a belongs to his former wife and that the debt in SOR allegation 1.b is not\nhis. This mitigating condition is only partially applicable because his major outstanding\ndebts remain unresolved, and he has not made sufficient progress in his current\nChapter 13 bankruptcy to receive full mitigating credit. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant does\nnot have an established payment plan for his major SOR debts. He intends to develop a\nplan through bankruptcy, however, his future intent is insufficient for me to apply this\nmitigating condition.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20 (e), mitigation may occur if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis\nto dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not applicable.\n21\n9\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputed the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.h\non the grounds that this medical bill should have been paid by the insurance company.\nAs he has not provided a copy of any formal dispute on this debt, this mitigating\ncondition is not applicable. He also disputed his responsibility for the debts in SOR\nallegations 1. and 1.b. I am satisfied these two debts totaling $1,175 are not his debts.21\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of denying a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of granting his\nsecurity clearance. In reaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this\ncase. Applicant moved up rapidly in his job between 1998 and 2005, increasing his\nhousehold income. He also spent more money. In 2004, the first of many financial\nsetbacks began when a hurricane struck where he lived and significantly damaged his\nhouse. As he tried to recover from this damage and its financial impact, his job required\nhim to reduce his work hours and take a pay cut for three months. The loss of income\nfurther strained his household finances. He managed to pay his bills until a second and\n\n10\nmore lengthy work slow down began in November 2005. Although he used his 401K\nmoney to help pay his bills, he exhausted this money and his savings. His debt\nproblems continued despite his efforts to resolve the debts. He filed for bankruptcy in\n2007, but stopped his payments when his monthly mortgage payment increased by\nseveral hundred dollars. He eventually reached a resolution of his mortgage debt by\nreturning his house to the mortgagor. His wife\u2019s alcoholism and their subsequent\ndivorce created additional financial strain for him. Throughout all his problems, Applicant\ntried, not always successfully, to resolve or manage his debts. Applicant has made a\ndiligent effort to gain control of his finances, but his unpaid debts are significant. He\nrecently started the process to file a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy. At this time,\nApplicant manages his current monthly living expenses without generating additional\ndelinquent debt. His problem remains the significant unpaid debt he still has, which is\nnot resolved and remains a security concern. \nShould he develop a manageable repayment plan through the bankruptcy court\nand establish a track record of compliance with his payment plan, he can reapply for his\nclearance in a year and his application should be favorably considered.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances and under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He honestly admitted this use during the security clearance investigation,\nand there was no other evidence of it. He persuasively established his intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on October 7, 2007. On November 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 26, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 12, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 30,\n2009, and the case was assigned to me on February 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 17, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 10,\n2009. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without\nobjection except for pages 3 and 4 of GE 3. Those two pages were excluded pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.20. The Government also requested that I take administrative notice\nof the fact that marijuana is a controlled substance. Applicant had no objection, and\nadministrative notice was taken of that fact. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A through Y, which were admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 20, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the truth of SOR \u00b6 1.b, and\ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a.

In a\nSeptember 1991 security clearance application submitted in connection with upgrading\nhis clearance from Secret to Top Secret, he also answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question asking\nabout drug use, and stated he \u201cexperimented with cannabis about 6 times between\n1980-1986, no future intent.\u201d (GE 1 at 4, 7.) \nIn his July 10, 2008, response to DOHA interrogatories concerning drugs,\nApplicant confirmed his use of cannabis. He described the frequency as \u201c1-3 times over\nseveral years time,\u201d with an average quantity of \u201c1/20 gram.\u201d He stated the date last\nused was \u201clate 2006 or early 2007,\u201d and that he had \u201cno intention for future use.\u201d He\nsaid he decided to stop using illegal substances \u201cin mid to late 2006 or early 2007,\u201d\nbecause \u201cafter ethics training and the determination was made that even thou [sic] the\nuse of cannabis is socially acceptable (with some groups) it is not ethacly [sic] legal in\nany quantity.\u201d When asked if he frequented places where he had reason to believe\n\n3\nillegal substances are being used, he replied \u201cyes\u201d and explained \u201cit is not planned to be\nin places where the use of illegal substances are present but at infrequent social events\n(1-2 times annually) it could be present.\u201d When asked to describe changes in his\nsituation which might be indicative of a change of lifestyle away from past drug usage,\nhe responded \u201cprofessional training on ethics vs. socially acceptable has changed my\nview on drug usage. Some things even if accepted are still illegal, like the social use of\ncannabis or speeding in your car.\u201d His final comments were \u201cThe use of any cannabis is\nillegal. I have not been using any illegal substances and have no intention of using any\nin the future.\u201d (GE 3 at 9, 11, 12.)\nApplicant testified that his post-college drug use occurred on only three\noccasions, during camping trips with high school friends in October 2005, March 2006,\nand October 2006. He said that on one evening during each trip, marijuana provided by\nthe friends was passed around and he smoked it by inhaling one to three times per use.\nHe was unable to explain why his earlier descriptions of his drug use apparently\ndescribed more frequent activity than this explanation, except to say that he was in a\nhurry when making the earlier statements. He admitted purchasing marijuana while in\ncollege, but denied doing so in the past seven years. (Tr. at 95-96, 114-120, 129.)\nDepartment Counsel asked Applicant whether he knew he was not supposed to\nsmoke marijuana while holding a security clearance after having been questioned about\nhis prior marijuana use during earlier security clearance processing. After discussing\n\u201can inferred expectation\u201d and \u201can inferred intention that you are not supposed to use\nmarijuana,\u201d he finally admitted that he did know that as early as 1991 and through\ncompleting four or five questionnaires for updating his clearance over the years. (Tr. at\n106-109.)\nAfter receiving the SOR, Applicant underwent a Chemical Dependency\nAssessment by a state-licensed Chemical Dependency Counselor. This included a\nurinalysis test that was negative. Based on the information obtained in the assessment\nprocess, the counselor found insufficient evidence of substance abuse or dependence.\nHowever, based on the circumstances that led to his referral for assessment by his\nattorney, the counselor recommended that he attend the eight-hour Alcohol and Other\nDrug Information School, which he completed in February 2009. Applicant told the\ncounselor that he had used marijuana on only three occasions since age 22. He also\nreported having used marijuana from one to four times per week from ages 16 to 22,\nduring 1980 to 1986. (AE B; AE C.)\nApplicant\u2019s wife was aware of his drug use. After receiving the SOR, he also\ninformed his supervisors at work. He submitted very strong character reference letters\nfrom numerous supervisors, company security personnel, coworkers, and beneficiaries\nof his various community service efforts. All expressed their confidence in his integrity,\ndedication to serve the national defense, and commitment to meticulous protection of\nclassified information. He received several exceptional performance awards and\nroutinely outstanding annual performance appraisals for his work. (AE B at 5; AE D\nthrough Y; Tr. at 80-92, 125-126.)\n\n4\nApplicant has ended his association with the group involved in his 2005 and 2006\nmarijuana use. He firmly and convincingly declared his intent never to use marijuana or\nany other controlled substance again during his testimony, and submitted a sworn\nwritten declaration of his intent never to do so with an agreement to automatic\nrevocation of his clearance for any violation. He also expressed his willingness to\nundergo any type of urinalysis screening his employer may ask him to undergo. (AE A;\nTr. at 97-102.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n5\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence in this case are: \u201c(a)\nany drug abuse;\u201d \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and\n\u201c(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d Applicant frequently\npurchased and used marijuana between 1980 and 1986, when he finished college. He\nalso admitted to recreational use of a small amount of marijuana on three different\ncamping trips in October 2005, March 2006, and October 2006, during which time he\nheld a security clearance. He then stopped using it, both because it is incompatible with\nholding a security clearance and because it is illegal. He does not intentionally attend\nsocial functions where marijuana will be present or used, and since October 2006 he\nhas not used any even if others do so.   \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that an applicant could establish in order to mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions raised by this record include: \u201c(a) the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and \u201c(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence; and, (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use during the 1980s took place while he was\nyoung and a student, and occurred more than 22 years ago. He stopped after college,\nand successfully held high-level security clearances and responsible managerial\npositions for many years thereafter. On three more recent occasions, from 38 to 44\nmonths ago, he used a small amount of marijuana in a social setting completely\nremoved from any workplace connection. Applicant now understands that what he\nformerly considered casual and socially acceptable marijuana use is both morally wrong\nand incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. He clearly values the ability to\nperform the important work for which his supervisors and security managers support his\nclearance far more than he values any future drug use. Applicant met his burden of\n\n6\nestablishing that his drug possession and use occurred under circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or\ngood judgment (AG \u00b6 26(a)). Applicant provided substantial evidence of his intent not to\nabuse drugs in the future, including his disassociation from drug-using contacts, his\nabstinence for more than two and a half years, and his signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation (\u00b6 26(b)). This case did not involve abuse of prescription drugs,\nnor was any drug treatment program prescribed after his positive chemical dependency\nassessment, so neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (c) nor (d) apply. He did successfully complete and\nbenefit from the recommended Alcohol and Other Drug Information School, however. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved a six-year period of marijuana use more than 22 years ago while he\nwas a student, and three times he used a small amount of marijuana while camping with\nfriends in 2005 and 2006. He was never arrested for this, never distributed any drugs,\nnever tested positive for use or showed any impairment or other effects at work, where\nhe excelled. These three incidents occurred when he was mature and fully responsible\nfor his choices, but in a social situation where it was considered acceptable behavior.\nHe decided to stop smoking marijuana for good after attending ethics training and\nrealizing it was morally wrongful to break the law in that way. He has not done so since.\nThis behavioral change appears to be permanent and drug use is most unlikely to recur.\nApplicant\u2019s motivation for the conduct was social enjoyment, but that interest is now\nheavily outweighed by his desire to be a good parent and to be worthy of a security\nclearance to do pending, important work. A highly impressive, serious, and convincing\ngroup of character witnesses attested credibly to their confidence in his integrity and\n\n7\ndetermination to refrain from any future drug use or other irresponsible behavior. His\nintegrity and the credibility of his commitment to abstain from further drug abuse are\nfurther bolstered by his sincerity and demeanor while testifying as well as the fact that\nthe only evidence of his drug use are his candid admissions to having done so. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance was casual and\noccurred under unique circumstances while camping with old school friends that will not\nrecur. His supervisors and coworkers were surprised to learn he had used marijuana,\nbut were neither surprised by his honesty about it when asked, nor the least bit doubtful\nof his determination and ability to stop. There is no susceptibility to coercion or duress\narising from this past conduct, since it is known to all whose knowledge of it could be\ndetrimental to Applicant. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has fully met his burden to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from his drug involvement.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nWITHDRAWN AND DISMISSED\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nWithdrawn and Dismissed\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the current\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on July 27, 2010, Applicant admitted the 26 allegations\nraised under Guideline F, nine of the 10 allegations raised under Guideline E, and failed\nto respond to the allegation noted under Guideline J.  He also requested the matter be\n1\nNovember 9, 2010\n\n FORM, Item 7 (Interrogatories, dated Jan. 6, 2009), at 9.\n      2\n FORM, Item 5 (Security Clearance Application, dated Mar. 7, 2007), at 41 of 46.

On August 20, 2010, Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included 13 attached\nitems. Applicant received the FORM on September 13, 2010, but did not timely respond\nor object to its contents. The case was assigned to me on November 8, 2010. Based on\na review of the case file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his\nburden regarding the security concerns raised under the three guidelines at issue.\nSecurity clearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old manufacturer who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since September 2006. He served in the U.S. military from 1990 until 1993,\nwhen he received a general discharge under honorable conditions as a result of\nmisconduct (drug abuse). Applicant has earned 24 college credits. He was divorced in\n1996 and remarried in 2006. He has three children. He chose an administrative\ndetermination and provided scant information regarding his personal life or financial\nsituation. \nApplicant first began drinking alcohol in 1989.  When he joined the service, he\n2\ndrank everyday after work. By at least July 1993, he had begun using marijuana.  In\n3\nSeptember 1993, he was given a general discharge from military service for drug\nabuse. In about March 1994, he was arrested and charged with simple marijuana\npossession and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was fined for both charges. In\nMarch 1997, he was charged with both hit-and-run and driving under the influence of\nalcohol (DUI). The hit-and-run charge was not prosecuted, but Applicant was fined,\nplaced on probation for two years, and sentenced to three days in jail for the DUI. In\nabout June 2000, he was charged with DUI and ordered to pay a fine. In about October\n2003, he was charged with DUI, fined, and placed on probation. In about May 2005, he\nwas charged with DUI, but Applicant pled guilty to driving while ability impaired (DWAI).\nHe was fined, sentenced to 24 hours of community service and 24 days in jail with work\nrelease, attended alcohol education, and placed on probation for 15 months. In about\nJuly 2005, Applicant was charged with harassment. He received an 18-month deferred\nsentence and the charge was later dismissed. In about August 2007, he was cited for\nfailure to display proof of insurance and fined $459. In about January 2009, he was\ncharged with intent to annoy, but no charges were ultimately filed. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application on March 27, 2007. In\nresponse to Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies, Applicant denied having been\n\n Id., at 43-44 of 46. At the time, the debts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.o, 1.q, and 1.y were\n      4\ndelinquent.

The space for net income is blank. It is possible the $2,500\n      10\nnoted as total deductions was meant to be on the line for net salary. Regardless, his expenses are greater\nthan his income.\n Id. There is no indication of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income.\n      11\n Id.\n      12\n3\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt or debts in the preceding seven years, and\ndenied being currently delinquent on any debts for over 90 days.4\nIn answering the February 2010 SOR, Applicant admitted to 25 delinquent debts\namounting to approximately $18,262. On their face, approximately $1,500 are reflected\nas eight medical accounts. The debts cited in the SOR were noted in credit reports from\nbetween April 2007 and February 2010.  Despite his 2010 admissions in his response\n5\nto the SOR, he previously denied knowledge of some of the accounts in November\n2007.  It appears that Applicant\u2019s personal information may have been stolen or\n6\ncompromised by his brother. Applicant submitted no evidence showing that he has\nsought to verify any of the accounts at issue. Only the debt noted at  SOR allegation \u00b6\n1.g for $748 was disputed.  \n7\nAs of March 2010, Applicant was pursuing Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. No\nevidence of bankruptcy filing was submitted. There is no evidence his debts are related\nto his 1996 divorce. Applicant\u2019s SCA shows that he was continuously employed from\nMay 1996 through the time he assumed his current position. Although there is evidence\nhe was away from work for about four weeks following a November 2008 hernia\nsurgery, no evidence was offered showing that the medical debts at issue are related to\nthe hernia procedure or that he was on unpaid leave during his recovery.  \n8\nApplicant pursued credit counseling in September 2008 and devised an action\nplan, but there is no evidence it helped him address his debts or led to a viable\nrepayment plan.  A 2009 budget shows monthly gross income of $2,500 and\n9\ndeductions of $2,500, suggesting he has no net monthly income.  Total monthly\n10\nexpenses reflect a sum amounting to about $4,400.  No assets or outstanding financial\n11\nobligations are noted in the budget.12\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      13\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

An applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted\nby applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something\n13\nless than a preponderance of evidence. The burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n14\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d The \u201cclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n15\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\n\n Id.\n      16\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      17\n Id.\n      18\n5\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  A security clearance denial does not\n16\nnecessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines established for issuing a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  It\n17\nalso states that \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Here, Applicant admitted to about $18,262 in\n18\ndelinquent debt. Therefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations) apply. With such conditions raised, it is left to\nApplicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security concerns.  \nApplicant previously stated that he did not recognize or know about some of the\ndebts at issue, but later admitted all 25 debt-related allegations listed in the SOR.  The\nevidence shows that only one account was disputed. There is no evidence that any\nefforts have been exerted to address these debts, except information that he was\npursuing bankruptcy protection as of March 2010. Applicant failed to provide any\nevidence regarding a bankruptcy filing in response to the June 2010 SOR or the August\n2010 FORM. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant has not been unemployed for over a decade. There is no evidence any\nof the debts at issue are related to his 1996 divorce, 2008 hernia surgery, or possible\nidentity theft. There is no evidence he has disputed more than one delinquent debt.\nInsufficient evidence was offered to raise Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances).\nApplicant received credit counseling, but there is no evidence it resulted in a\nregular and successful repayment plan or otherwise helped him address the debts at\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      19\n Id.\n      20\n6\nissue.  He admitted all 25 debts at issue, no evidence of a successful Chapter 7\nbankruptcy filing was offered, and no evidence was presented showing any recent\nefforts to address his debts. Therefore, neither FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control) nor FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts)\napplies. Financial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, security concerns arise because \u201cconduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n19\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  Here,\n20\npersonal conduct concerns were raised when Applicant received a general discharge\nfrom the service for drug abuse; was charged and fined for marijuana possession and\npossession of drug paraphernalia in 1994; sentenced, fined, and placed on probation\nfor DUI in 1997; fined for DUI in 2000; fined and placed on probation for DUI in 2003;\npled guilty to DWAI in 2005; charged with harassment in 2005; denied having any\ndelinquent accounts on his 2007 SCA; fined for failure to display proof of insurance in\n2007; and arrested for intent to annoy in 2009. \nApplicant admitted all related allegations, except for the allegation that he\nfalsified material facts on his SCA for not noting four specified delinquent debts. He\nfailed, however, to identify a reason for his failure to note those debts on his SOR. Such\nfacts are sufficient to raise Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) and AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information).  Consequently, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the resultant security concerns raised by the\nallegations.\nApplicant offered no evidence in mitigation of the allegations cited under\nGuideline E, although it can be surmised from the record he either did not recognize or\n\n AG \u00b6 30.\n      21\n7\nhad no knowledge of the four debts he failed to note on his SCA. While such a position\nmay rebut the allegation of intentional falsification or omission with regard to SOR\nallegation \u00b6 2.h, it provides no mitigation for the remaining nine allegations under the\nguideline. Personal conduct security concerns remain unmitigated.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nThe concern under this guideline is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d21\nIn raising this guideline, the SOR references seven allegations previously addressed\nunder Guideline E (Applicant was charged and fined for marijuana possession and\npossession of drug paraphernalia in 1994; sentenced, fined, and placed on probation\nfor DUI in 1997; fined for DUI in 2000; fined and placed on probation for DUI in 2003;\npled guilty to DWAI in 2005; charged with harassment in 2005; and arrested for intent to\nannoy in 2009). Applicant admitted those allegations under Guideline E, but failed to\nadmit or deny them under Guideline F. His admission of the underlying facts under\nGuideline E, however, is sufficient to raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Consequently, Applicant must offer\nevidence mitigating related security concerns.\nInsufficient record evidence was introduced for the application of Criminal\nConduct Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment), AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act\nand those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life), or AG \u00b6 32 (d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement). None of\nthe other mitigating conditions apply. Therefore, criminal conduct security concerns\nremain unmitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the AG and the whole-\n\n8\nperson concept. As noted above, the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant\nseeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a 42-year-old husband and father of three children. He served in\nthe U.S. military and finished 24 college credits. He has worked for the same employer\nsince 2006. \nApplicant provided nominal information regarding his personal life and his\nfinances.  Since 1994, he has had numerous brushes with the law, many of them\nrelated to alcohol. He was last arrested in 2009. Meanwhile, between the mid-2000s\nand 2009, he acquired over $18,000 in delinquent debt. While he has received credit\ncounseling, there is scant evidence he has tried to address his debts. He pursued filing\nfor Chapter 7 protection to address his financial situation, but there is no evidence a\nbankruptcy filing was made. Moreover, his written budget reflects expenses that far\nexceed his income. There is enough evidence to suggest he was unaware of his\ncomplete financial situation and the contents of his credit report in 2007 to rebut the\nallegation that he intentionally falsified his SCA regarding his delinquent debts.\nInsufficient evidence, however, was submitted to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate any of\nthe other allegations raised under the three guidelines at issue. Therefore, financial\nconsiderations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns remain\nunmitigated. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.i - 2.j:\nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation. Clearance denied.\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Activity). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, the Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 11, 2008. In his August\n18, 2008, response to the SOR, he admitted all allegations under both guidelines and\nrequested the opportunity to review and respond to the documentary evidence\nsupporting the SOR. He also requested a determination based on the written record. \n\n FORM, Item 6, Certificate of Release or Discharge; Response to the FORM, Summary at 4-5.\n1\n2\nIn response to Applicant\u2019s answer, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM), dated September 16, 2008. Applicant received the FORM\non September 22, 2008. His response, dated October 23, 2008, was accepted into the\nrecord without objection by Department Counsel on October 31, 2008. \nThe case was forwarded to DOHA for assignment to an Administrative Judge for\na determination. The case was assigned to me on November 5, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I find it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old quality engineer employed by a Defense contractor.\nApplicant was married in 1979 and the couple had two children. The marriage ended in\ndivorce in 2003. In 2005, he remarried. Applicant actively served in the U.S. Navy for\nnearly 30 years before being honorably discharged. At the time of his retirement,\nApplicant had attained the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. His military record is\nimpressive, contains many highlights, and he was awarded with several decorations.1\nStarting in 1975, at about the age of 18 or 19, Applicant began drinking alcoholic\nbeverages. Devoted to his military career, his consumption of alcohol was infrequent\nand mainly limited to social settings for the first 25 years. Alcohol abuse started to\nimpact his life after 2000 with the onset of a string of events. His wife filed for divorce in\nSeptember 2002. Three months later, his mother suddenly and unexpectedly died in\nDecember 2002. It became his pattern to have 2-5 beers a night after work, 3-4 days a\nweek. The following year, in December 2003, Applicant retired from the Navy. \nAfter retirement, Applicant\u2019s self-control over his drinking wavered as he\nremained idle for a couple of years. In about January 2004, he was arrested and\ncharged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He was fined and sentenced to one\nyear of probation. In approximately July 2005, around the time he accepted a brief\nperiod of employment in a position below his abilities, he was again arrested and\ncharged with DUI. He was fined and sentenced to one year of probation. In\napproximately March 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI for a third\ntime and Applicant last consumed alcohol on March 9, 2007. Applicant was fined and\nsentenced to 180 days in jail, with all but 20 days suspended. He was also put on three\nyears of probation and ordered to receive alcohol counseling at a medically certified\ncenter for substance abuse.\nFrom June 2007 through September 2007, Applicant underwent the prescribed\nalcohol counseling. After his initial alcohol screening and personal examination, he was\ndirected by the center to attend a weekly group Outpatient session at the recovery\ncenter and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) once a week. He also met monthly\nwith his clinician, a Licensed Clinical Drug Counselor (LCDCIII) with a Master of\n\n Response to FORM at 3.\n2\n Response to FORM, Encl. 2 (Probation Officer Letter, dated Oct. 7, 2008).\n3\n3\nScience degree. Applicant attended all the Outpatient sessions and opted to attend\nA.A. two to three times a week, beyond the number prescribed by the center.\nRecognizing that he had a problem helped expedite his recovery. With his requirements\ncompleted, a history of clean random drug and alcohol tests, and his clinician\u2019s\nfavorable determination regarding his success, he was discharged from the center in\nSeptember 2007, one month earlier than anticipated. He remains alcohol-free to date.\nWhile undergoing outpatient treatment, Applicant was also undergoing a 90-day\nprobationary period as a full-time quality inspector for a technology company.  Due to\n2\nhis performance, he was ultimately one of the few temporary employees chosen to\nbecome permanent. That trial experience and his military background qualified him for\nselection at his current company as a quality engineer, rather than simply a quality\ninspector. His current job evaluation shows that his performance is solidly in the good to\nexcellent range with regard to competencies in the areas of cooperation, versatility,\nattendance, and professionalism.\nApplicant takes full responsibility for his DUIs and alcohol abuse, noting his\nembarrassment and contrition for his inability to modify his behavior earlier. He stresses\nthat these incidents do not reflect who he is now or how he was raised. He understands\nthat he is simply unable to consume alcohol responsibly and is resolved to refrain from\nits use in the future. Noting Applicant\u2019s favorable prognosis upon discharge from the\ncenter, Applicant\u2019s probation officer following his second DUI stresses that Applicant\nalways passed his drug and alcohol screenings and otherwise complied with all aspects\nof his probation: \u201cHe was one of the most responsible, capable, and respectful people I\nhave ever had on reporting probation.\u201d  \n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n6\n Id.\n7\n Id.\n8\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n9\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n4\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n5\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n6\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n7\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n8\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n9\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\n\n5\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption. The Concern: Excessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  \nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nIssues regarding one\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness can arise from unbridled\nalcohol consumption because it can lead to uncontrolled impulses and questionable\njudgment. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI in 2004, 2005, and 2007.\nConsequently, Alcohol Consumption (AC) Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1, AG \u00b6 22(a)\n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent) applies. With a disqualifying condition thus established, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to mitigate related security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s problem with alcohol did not manifest itself until 2004, when he\nreceived his first DUI. He failed to manage his alcohol consumption, resulting in a 2005\nDUI. The problem remained unaddressed until after he received his third DUI in 2007,\nat which point the court ordered that he seek counseling. Therefore AC Mitigating\nCondition (MC) 1, AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply.  \nAlthough Applicant fully acknowledges his abuse of alcohol and has provided\ndetails as to his outpatient counseling, only a little over a year has passed since he\ncompleted his alcohol counseling program. Applicant was incident free for longer\nperiods of time between his three DUIs. Moreover, he is less than half way through the\nthree year probation ordered in 2007. Therefore, it would be premature to say that this\nperiod of sobriety, as earnest and committed as he is to staying alcohol-free, is\nsufficient for significantly establishing a pattern of abstinence or responsible use.\n\n6\nTherefore, AC MC 2, AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or\nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser) does not apply. \nOn its face, AC MC 4, AG \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment plan) merits close consideration. Despite\nApplicant\u2019s compliance with his center\u2019s programmatic requirements, successful\ncompletion of that program a year ago with a positive prognosis, and approximately 19\nmonths of sobriety, a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence remains ill-defined,\nas discussed above. Moreover, his clinician was a licensed clinical drug counselor III.\nAlthough she possesses a master\u2019s degree, those credentials do not match the\nrequisites set forth in this mitigating condition. Therefore, this condition does not apply.\nNone of the other AC MCs apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established\nits case. Applicant admits that he received three DUIs between 2004 and 2007. Such\nconduct and admissions are sufficient to raise security concerns, invoke Criminal\nConduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses), CC DC 3, AG \u00b631(c) (allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted,\nor convicted), and CC DC 4, AG \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation)\nand initiate inquiry.\nThe crimes at issue took place between 2004 and last year, in 2007. They\nresulted from Applicant\u2019s repeated inability to control his use of alcohol. They also\nresulted after he repeatedly failed to learn from his past conviction(s) not to drink and\ndrive. Therefore, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 1, AG \u00b6 32(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant notes that his wife filed for divorce in the fall of 2003 and that\nhis mother tragically died a few months later, Applicant was apparently able to complete\nhis final year in the Navy without succumbing to apparent alcohol abuse and criminal\nconduct. Therefore, CC MC 2, AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into\ncommitting the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life) does\nnot apply. Applicant admits to the three DUIs alleged, obviating application of CC MC 3,\nAG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense). \n\n7\nApplicant was last cited for DUI in March 2007. While not remote in time, he has\naccomplished much in the intervening period. He successfully completed an alcohol\ncounseling program and has maintained sobriety for nearly 19 months. At the same\ntime, he returned to the workforce after a couple of years of idle retirement, proved\nhimself as a viable full-time quality inspector in private industry, and found a position as\na quality inspector. His appraisal in his current employment shows an excellent level of\nprofessionalism and attendance. Such factors raise CC MC 4, AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) and\nindicate his criminal past, a by-product of his abuse of alcohol and inability to comport\nhis behavior while under the influence, is well behind him. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a mature man with a significant amount of personal,\nprofessional, and military experience. Recently divorced and idle after nearly 30 years\nin the Navy, he began to lose the military control and self-restraint that helped him\nthrough a successful Navy career and started to abuse alcohol. Worse, he would drive\nhis automobile while intoxicated. He failed to seek help or manage his drinking and\ndriving habits until the third DUI, at which point he received appropriate counseling.\nOnce there, he recognized he had steered from his course. He now embraces sobriety\nand has successfully returned to the workforce. His actions lay out a blue print for\nmitigating alcohol abuse security concerns, but his period of sobriety has yet to endure\nfor as long as the periods between DUIs or the substantial completion of his probation.\nConsequently, 19 months of sobriety and a little over a year since completing\ncounseling does not present an established pattern of abstinence or controlled alcohol\nuse. Therefore, alcohol consumption security concerns thus far remain. \nSecurity concerns regarding his criminal conduct, however, are mitigated. The\ncrimes at issue are incidental to his past alcohol abuse, specifically the driving of a\n\n AG \u00b6 2(b).\n10\n8\nmotor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Applicant recognizes the illegality of that\nconduct and has expressed his commitment not to be a repeat offender. He has\nsuccessfully finished an alcohol counseling program, has a good prognosis,\nsimultaneously returned to the work force, and demonstrated his ability to rise and excel\nin his field. If Applicant should return to using alcohol, even socially, there is no\nindication that he will again break the law in relation to such use or abuse. Therefore,\ncriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of the national security.  Because Applicant\u2019s\n10\nperiod of sobriety is so recent, his resolve remains untested. Consequently, security\nconcerns yet remain regarding Applicant\u2019s past alcohol abuse. Clearance is revoked. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and 1.q (renumbered as \u00b6 2.a). His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He was married in August 1999, and has a nine-year- old child. He and his wife separated in November 2003, but are not divorced (Tr. 31). Applicant served on active duty in the Army from September 1994 to November 2003. He held a security clearance while on active duty, but it was withdrawn in January 2003, after he received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for wrongful appropriation in violation of Article 121, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (GX 7). The misconduct occurred when Applicant found a wallet in a parking lot. The wallet contained identification cards, a credit card, and $63. He decided to take the cash in the wallet because he needed money. At the time, he was the sole support for five people: himself, his wife and their child, and two children from his wife\u2019s previous relationship. He kept the cash and discarded the wallet and its other contents. After a few hours, he reconsidered, contacted the Military Police, and helped them retrieve the wallet (Tr. 34-38).

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 13, 2007. On \nMarch 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 27, 2009, and answered it on April 30, \n2009. DOHA received his response on May 9, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on June 8, 2009, and the case was assigned to an administrative judge on \nJune 11, 2009. It was reassigned to me on July 15, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on July 21, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 18, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nC, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until August 26, 2009, \nto enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX \nD through G, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to \nAX D through G is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 24, 2009. The record closed on August 26, 2009. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.q alleged three counts of larceny. Both sides agreed that SOR \u00b6 \n1.q did not allege a financial concern and would be more appropriately alleged as \npersonal conduct under Guideline E. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion, without \nobjection from Applicant, to amend the SOR by renumbering SOR \u00b6 1.q as SOR \u00b6 2.a \nunder Guideline E (Tr. 96). The amendment is handwritten on the SOR. Applicant \nstated he did not need or desire additional time to prepare his response to the amended \nSOR (Tr. 97). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, \nand 1.q (renumbered as \u00b6 2.a). His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He was married in August 1999, and has a nine-year-\nold child. He and his wife separated in November 2003, but are not divorced (Tr. 31).  \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from September 1994 to November \n2003. He held a security clearance while on active duty, but it was withdrawn in January \n2003, after he received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for wrongful appropriation in violation of \nArticle 121, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (GX 7). The misconduct occurred when Applicant \nfound a wallet in a parking lot. The wallet contained identification cards, a credit card, \nand $63. He decided to take the cash in the wallet because he needed money. At the \ntime, he was the sole support for five people: himself, his wife and their child, and two \nchildren from his wife\u2019s previous relationship. He kept the cash and discarded the wallet \nand its other contents. After a few hours, he reconsidered, contacted the Military Police, \nand helped them retrieve the wallet (Tr. 34-38). His misconduct also was the basis for \nhis administrative discharge from the Army. He received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions (AX E at 2).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAfter his discharge in November 2003, Applicant was unemployed until May \n2004. He and his son lived with his parents some of the time and in a friend\u2019s apartment \nsome of the time (Tr. 38-40). He then worked at various jobs but was unemployed from \nJune to October 2005. He was employed until December 2005 and again unemployed \nuntil July 2006, when he was hired by a federal contractor as a systems analyst. He \nattended college part-time from August 2005 to March 2006. When he dropped out of \nschool, his student loans (SOR \u00b6 1.a) became due. He began working as a senior \ncomputer systems analyst for his current employer in January 2007. He does not have a \nclearance (Tr. 13-14, 24). \n \n \nApplicant testified he had negotiated a payment agreement for the tuition debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and he made two or three payments of $150 (Tr. 68). He admitted \nthis debt in his answer to the SOR. He did not produce any documentation of the \npayment agreement or his payments at the hearing or in his post-hearing submission.  \n \n \nThe debt for unpaid rent (SOR \u00b6 1.b) arose while Applicant was in the Army. He \nterminated his lease when he was reassigned overseas, and he provided his landlord \nwith a copy of his orders. The landlord sued, but the lawsuit was dismissed when \nneither party appeared. Applicant was unaware of the lawsuit until he found out there \nwas an eviction on his record that made him unable to rent an apartment after he was \ndischarged from the Army (Tr. 56). The landlord obtained a second judgment for a \nsubstantially reduced amount in March 2008, long after Applicant left the Army. The \noriginal landlord is no longer in business and Applicant has been unable to contact him \n(Tr. 54-59). Applicant has not attempted to negotiate with the collection agency to which \nthe debt was referred.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and \n1.m were for accounts opened by his wife in his name and without his permission after \nthey separated. He has not disputed any of the debts (Tr. 100-01). The account listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.n was opened by his wife with his permission, and it is unpaid (Tr. 85). He \ntestified he placed a security alert on his credit record in 2007, and his wife has not \nbeen able to open any more accounts in his name (Tr. 89). The security alert is \nreflected on his credit report dated September 15, 2007 (GX 4 at 1).  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e arose when Applicant agreed to pay his parents\u2019 \nutility bill while he was living with them, and he put the account in his name. His parents \nhave resumed paying their own utilities, but Applicant has not paid the charges that \naccrued while he was responsible for the account (Tr. 74-75). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a delinquent student loan and is unpaid. \nApplicant admitted this debt in his answer to the SOR. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i was for a video that was not returned (Tr. 79-80). \nApplicant testified the account was resolved, but he presented no documentation at the \nhearing or in his post-hearing submission.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j arose when Applicant\u2019s mother opened an account \nin his name, with his permission, to purchase a washer and dryer. She promised to \nmake the payments and told him she was making the minimum payment each month \n(Tr. 80-82). The debt is unresolved. \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nCollege books \nand fees \n$1,426 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; Tr. 68 \n1.b \nUnpaid Rent \n$7,197 \nJudgment entered Mar. \n2008 for $2,312; unpaid \nAX A; Tr. 54-59 \n1.c \nCable Service \n$1,113 \nWife\u2019s debt; unpaid \nTr. 70-71 \n1.d \nTelephone \n$351 \nWife\u2019s debt; unpaid \nTr. 72-73 \n1.e \nUtilities \n$309 \nUnpaid \nTr. 74 \n1.f \nCell phone \n$819 \nWife\u2019 debt; unpaid \nTr. 75-76 \n1.g \nStudent loan \n$2,781 \nUnpaid \nTr. 77-78 \n1.h \nTelephone \n$307 \nWife\u2019s debt; unpaid \nTr. 78-79 \n1.i \nVideo rental \n$210 \nNo documentation of \nsettlement \nTr. 79-80 \n1.j \nCredit card \n$1,810 \nUnpaid \nTr. 80-81 \n1.k \nCell phone \n$2,077 \nWife\u2019s debt; unpaid \nTr. 83-84 \n1.l \nTelephone \n$383 \nWife\u2019s debt; unpaid \nTr. 84 \n1.m \nTelephone \n$78 \nWife\u2019s debt; unpaid \nTr. 84 \n1.n \nTelephone \n$477 \nUnpaid \nTr. 85 \n1.o \nCharge account $548 \nDisputed \nAX G; Tr. 87-88 \n1.p \nCharge account $274 \nDisputed \nAX G \n \n \nApplicant currently earns about $52,000 per year, and his net pay is about \n$36,000 to $38,000. He does not own a home or a car. He lives paycheck-to-paycheck. \nHe spends about $680 per month for child care and sends his mother $200-$250 every \ntwo weeks. He is contributing to a retirement account and has about $200 in savings \n(Tr. 46-52). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents recently agreed to accept legal custody of his son and care \nfor him (Tr. 90-91). This agreement will relieve Applicant of the monthly expenditure of \n$680 for child care. Applicant also is advertising for a roommate to help pay the rent on \nhis apartment (Tr. 63-64). He testified he intends to use the additional income to pay off \nhis debts.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n5 \n \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $20,000. Applicant has \nadmitted the two largest debts. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 \nas follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises these three disqualifying conditions, shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are numerous and not yet resolved. Some of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.k -1.m) were incurred by his wife without his knowledge or consent. \nThis circumstance is unlikely to recur. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is applicable to the debts \nincurred by his wife without his knowledge or consent. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment from \nthe date of his discharge from the Army in November 2003 until May 2004 was due to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhis own misconduct, but his subsequent periods of unemployment and his wife\u2019s \nfraudulent conduct were beyond his control. He minimized his housing expenses by \nliving with parents or friends. He has been continuously employed since July 2006, but \nhas made little effort to resolve his financial situation. He has not disputed or resolved \nthe debts he attributes to his wife\u2019s fraudulent behavior. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nestablished for the debts incurred by his wife without his knowledge or consent. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received \ncounseling since his discharge from the Army and his financial problems are not under \ncontrol.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case \nNo. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that \nan applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. Id. \n \n \nApplicant testified he was making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nand that the debt to the video store was resolved, but he produced no documentation to \nsupport his testimony. The remaining debts are unresolved. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nhas disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p and provided documentation of \nthe dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) is established for these two debts. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant wrongfully appropriated another person\u2019s wallet \nand its contents while he was in the Army, and he has admitted this allegation. The \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to Applicant\u2019s \ndishonest conduct: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): [C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \nAG \u00b6 16(d): [C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information in the \nworkplace.  \nAG \u00b6 16(e): [P]ersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises all three of these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \ncommander appeared to treat his offense as minor, disposing of it by nonjudicial \npunishment rather than a court-martial. Whether that disposition was in recognition of \nApplicant\u2019s nine years of honorable service cannot be determined from this record. \nNevertheless, it was an isolated incident that occurred almost nine years ago. Applicant \nhas not repeated his dishonest conduct despite his continuing need for additional \nincome. Under all the circumstances, his conduct does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant was candid and sincere at the hearing. He was remorseful for his \ndishonest conduct while in the Army. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on \nhis personal conduct, but he has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.m: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.p: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations concerning his alcohol consumption, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.a because he thought it implied heavier drinking over the years than he would admit. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings. Applicant is a 50-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and a master\u2019s degree in 1998. He has no military service. He worked for his present employer, and held a security clearance without incident, from 1985 to 2000, when he left to accept a higher-paying offer from a consulting firm. That led to a series of layoffs and dot-com business failures, resulting in intermittent employment until he was rehired in October 2007. He is unmarried, with no children. (GE 1 at 6, 11, 13-35; Tr. at 77-82.) Applicant started drinking around 1977 while in college. Until his first significant unemployment period, from April 2001 to August 2003, he was a social drinker. He normally consumed about three beers a few times a week but occasionally drank to the point of intoxication. He then began to drink more heavily, to the point of daily consumption of larger amounts of alcohol. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. at 96-99.) In mid 2002, he consulted his doctor about panic attacks, and was advised to cut back his drinking. He did so for a month or two.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Laura Anderson, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) in 2002. He\ncompleted outpatient treatment for alcohol dependence as part of a deferred\nprosecution agreement. He had another alcohol-related arrest in 2006 and attended\nrelapse prevention treatment. In November 2008, he was inebriated at work. He very\nrecently completed another course of inpatient and outpatient treatment. He is making a\ngood effort at sobriety, but security concerns are insufficiently mitigated to date. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on November 6, 2007. On\nJune 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nNovember 27, 2009\n\n2\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 9, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 18, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 15, 2009, and the case\nwas assigned to me on July 21, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 24,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 25, 2009. The Government\noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\noffered exhibits (AE) A through D, which were also admitted without objection, and\ntestified on his own behalf. Two other witnesses also testified for Applicant. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until September 8, 2009, to permit\nsubmission of additional evidence. Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted that evidence on\nSeptember 3, 2009, and Department Counsel forwarded it the following day without\nobjection. That evidence was marked AE E and admitted. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on September 1, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations\nconcerning his alcohol consumption, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.a because he thought it\nimplied heavier drinking over the years than he would admit. His admissions are\nincorporated into the following findings. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor.\nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and a master\u2019s degree in 1998. He has no\nmilitary service. He worked for his present employer, and held a security clearance\nwithout incident, from 1985 to 2000, when he left to accept a higher-paying offer from a\nconsulting firm. That led to a series of layoffs and dot-com business failures, resulting in\nintermittent employment until he was rehired in October 2007. He is unmarried, with no\nchildren. (GE 1 at 6, 11, 13-35; Tr. at 77-82.)\nApplicant started drinking around 1977 while in college. Until his first significant\nunemployment period, from April 2001 to August 2003, he was a social drinker. He\nnormally consumed about three beers a few times a week but occasionally drank to the\npoint of intoxication. He then began to drink more heavily, to the point of daily\nconsumption of larger amounts of alcohol. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. at 96-99.) \nIn mid 2002, he consulted his doctor about panic attacks, and was advised to cut\nback his drinking. He did so for a month or two. In September 2002, after breaking up\nwith his girlfriend, he drove to a resort town about 135 miles northeast of his home.\nThere he ate and consumed beer and hard alcohol. Although he denied this during the\nhearing and did not mention it during his Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninterview, he told his alcohol treatment program case manager on October 5, 2006, that\nhe stopped at a liquor store on the way out of town and bought a bottle of vodka that he\ndrank as he drove home. While driving through a town about 15 miles south of his\n\n3\nhome, where he intended to stop for dinner, he \u201cfell asleep\u201d while driving and collided\nwith a utility pole. His air bags deployed and prevented any injury. He failed field\nsobriety and Breathalyzer tests and was arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence (DUI). (GE 1 at 41; GE 3 at 4, 27; Tr. at 98-99.)\nApplicant entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which required that he\nsuccessfully complete an approved alcohol treatment program, undergo two years of\nsupervised probation, install an ignition interlock on his car, and pay a fine of $2,000. He\nentered an intensive outpatient treatment program in July 2003 and continued there\nuntil January 2004. He then transferred to a different intensive outpatient program\ncloser to the location of a new job, which he attended during March and April 2004. In\nMay 2004, having lost the job, he transferred to another site operated by this second\nprogram closer to his home and completed his treatment successfully in November\n2005. His program reported this to his probation officer in a letter describing his\ncompliance with all program requirements, \u201cgood\u201d progress and \u201cvery favorable\u201d\nprognosis. It also described him as \u201ca very good example of how the deferred\nprosecution program can work to benefit the chemically dependent individual as well as\nthe community.\u201d He was then released from supervised probation. During his treatment,\nhe was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and was counseled to remain abstinent and\ncontinue with support groups upon his discharge. (GE 3 at 4, 19, 32; Tr. at 83-86.)\nApplicant started drinking again within a month or two of completing his treatment\nprogram, although he was not fully forthcoming about this during his hearing or the\nintake interview for his subsequent relapse prevention treatment program. (GE 3 at 26,\n27; Tr. at 102.) On February 25, 2006, he drove to a resort town in a neighboring state\nfor a wine and seafood festival, fully intending to drink. He drank so much wine, before\neating any food, that he became intoxicated to the point that he could not remember\nwhat happened. Based on his later review of police reports, he reported to the OPM\ninvestigator that he was asked to leave the festival by a security guard. When he did\nnot, the guard contacted a police officer, who asked him to put down his glass of wine.\nWhen Applicant forcibly resisted the guard and officer, he was arrested, charged with\nDisorderly Conduct and Harassment, and held overnight in jail. (GE 2; GE 3 at 3, 27; Tr.\nat 103-105.)\nIn April or May 2006, Applicant entered into a diversion program with the other\nstate\u2019s court, under which the pending criminal charges would be dismissed if he\ncompleted an approved alcohol treatment program. He returned to the facility where he\ncompleted his prior program, and entered a relapse prevention treatment program.\nDuring his September 6, 2006, initial intake interview, he told the counselor he drank \u201ca\nfew glasses of wine\u201d at the festival, and had not drunk any alcohol since then. His case\nmanager\u2019s notes from the October 5, 2006 counseling session reflect that Applicant\u2019s\ninitial intake urinalysis results were positive for alcohol. When confronted with this,\nApplicant said he thought he had admitted drinking since the festival. He successfully\ncompleted his relapse prevention program on April 2, 2007, and was discharged with a\ndiagnosis of Alcohol Dependence in early full remission. His prognosis was\n\u201c[s]atisfactory if patient continues his involvement in sober support network and working\n\n4\nwith his sponsor.\u201d It was recommended that he continue to maintain abstinence from\nalcohol and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). After Applicant reported completion\nof the program to the neighboring-state court, his charges were dismissed on April 9,\n2007. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 3-4, 15, 26-27; Tr. at 86-88, 103.) \nApplicant was rehired by his current employer in October 2007. In December\n2007, apparently unaware of the 2006 incident at the wine festival, his local court\ndismissed the 2002 DUI charge for having successfully completed his deferred\nprosecution agreement. He resumed drinking alcohol, and reported to the OPM\ninvestigator on January 31, 2008, that he had last drunk alcohol on December 31, 2007,\nand January 1, 2008, consuming a bottle of champagne by himself on each day. He told\nthe investigator that he was concerned that his past alcohol problems might jeopardize\nhis employment, which he valued very highly after many years of employment turmoil.\nLater, his supervisor began noticing alcohol-related attendance problems and counseled\nApplicant about them. Shortly thereafter, around November 21, 2008, Applicant was\nfound to be inebriated at work. Applicant testified that his alcohol consumption between\nApril 2007 and November 2008 was \u201cvery seldom,\u201d and that he could not recall how\nmuch he had to drink before the November incident at work. He was referred into an\nemployee assistance program that found a high level of alcohol content in his blood. He\nwas placed on a leave of absence in January 2009, to attend inpatient alcohol\ntreatment. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. at 64, 67-68, 72-73, 100, 106-108, 117-118.)\n \nApplicant attended inpatient alcohol treatment from January 2 through 15, 2009.\nAfter completing that program, he began an intensive outpatient program at a different\nfacility. He completed that program on August 17, 2009. He was compliant with all\nprogram requirements, and maintained abstinence throughout this period. The manager\nof his outpatient treatment center testified that Applicant demonstrated above average\ncommitment and dedication to the program. In describing Applicant\u2019s prognosis, he\nstated that Applicant will still continue to be alcohol dependent and he should continue\nto attend 12-step meetings. Since this manager is not a \u201cduly qualified medical\nprofessional,\u201d as defined under Guideline G, nor a licensed clinical social worker, his\nfacility medical director, who is an M.D., submitted a letter. He expressed his agreement\nwith the manager\u2019s assessment concerning Applicant\u2019s clinical course and pertinent\ninformation. He stated his belief that if Applicant follows his recommended program, he\nwill continue to do well and his prognosis will be excellent. Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor also\ndescribed Applicant\u2019s renewed commitment to sobriety and extensive participation in AA\nsince January 2009. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE E at 3; Tr. at 28-46.)\nThe employee assistance program under which Applicant attended both his\ninpatient and outpatient treatment programs lasts three years. It monitors his\ncompliance with follow-up recommendations and continuing abstinence through\nmeetings and random urinalysis testing. His program counselor, a licensed clinical\nsocial worker, reports that he has been compliant with all appointments, expectations,\nreferrals, tests, and subsequent treatment recommendations from inpatient, outpatient,\nand aftercare services as of August 26, 2009. (AE A; AE E at 4-5; Tr. at 22-23, 108-\n109.)\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified that his work has been generally satisfactory, but\nhe is in the bottom third of employees that he manages due to having less experience\nthan the others. He further said that Applicant\u2019s attendance at work since completing his\ninpatient treatment has been exemplary, and there has been absolutely no indication of\nany subsequent problem with alcohol. (Tr. at 52-74.) A close friend, who has known\nApplicant for 29 years, described him as \u201ctrustworthy, hard working, and highly\ncommitted.\u201d He further said he is, \u201ca loyal, honest, considerate, and supportive person\nwho cares deeply for other people.\u201d (AE D.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n6\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DCs). The DCs supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by\nDepartment Counsel are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program; and \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol rehabilitation program.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted DUI, Disorderly Conduct, and Harassment offenses in 2002\nand 2006 clearly raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22(a). Although charges were later\ndismissed through deferred prosecution and diversion agreements, he was sufficiently\nimpaired to have driven into a utility pole while unconscious, and to have been unable to\nremember forcibly resisting security and police personnel who were trying to prevent his\nfurther intoxication. He was evaluated as alcohol dependent by the licensed chemical\ndependency professionals and clinical social workers at all of the treatment clinics he\nattended, supporting application of AG \u00b6 22(e). Finally, he relapsed into regular alcohol\nconsumption in early 2006, a few months after completing his first alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram. This drinking continued even after his February 2006 arrest until his entry into\na second treatment program in September 2006, as evidenced by his positive intake\nurinalysis. He again relapsed within months after completing that second treatment\nprogram, and admitted consuming alcohol over the New Year 2008 holiday. Therefore,\nAG \u00b6 22(f) also supports security concerns. The subsequent alcohol-related attendance\n\n7\nproblems and November 2008 intoxication at work were not alleged in the SOR, so they\nwill not be considered as evidence used to support potential application of additional\nGuideline G DCs, but may be considered under mitigation and whole-person analysis. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s multiple alcohol-related incidents preclude a finding that the behavior\nwas infrequent, and his 2006 arrest and 2008 impairment at work were relatively recent.\nHe resumed drinking shortly after the successful completion of each of his lengthy\noutpatient treatment programs in November 2005 and April 2007. His resumed\nabstinence since his January 2009 inpatient treatment is not of sufficient duration to\nestablish that such conduct is unlikely to recur or no longer casts doubt on his reliability,\nespecially since he only finished intensive outpatient treatment about three months ago\nin August. Applicant did not yet establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant has\nacknowledged his alcoholism, and has begun to demonstrate effective action to\novercome it, but he has yet to establish a pattern of abstinence sufficient to overcome\nconcerns raised by his previous relapses. \nThere is no evidence that he has consumed alcohol since November 2008, and\nhe has made a substantial start toward establishing a pattern of responsible conduct\nand abstinence. However, as discussed above, insufficient time has passed to establish\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b) given the duration, pattern, and seriousness of his history\n\n8\nof alcohol abuse. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence yet to support mitigation under\neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) or (d), due to his history of relapses and the qualified nature of the\nfavorable prognoses by a duly qualified medical professional and qualified social\nworkers following each of his three treatment programs. All said, essentially, that his\nprognosis is favorable as long as he remains abstinent and follows their\nrecommendation to continue followup work with AA. The last two times he suffered\nrelapses within less than a year of completing treatment, and it has only been a few\nmonths since his completion of the most recent program. He is taking proper and\ncommendable measures to create future mitigation under these provisions, especially\nwith ongoing monitoring by his employee assistance program, but has not yet done so\nsufficiently to overcome the security concerns raised by his history and pattern of\nalcohol abuse.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involves multiple alcohol-related offenses over the past seven years, and his\nongoing alcohol dependence. All of this occurred while he was mature and accountable\nfor his actions. None of the incidents in and of itself was particularly serious since he\nwas fortunate enough not to have hurt himself or others. Taken together, however,\nthese incidents form a pattern reflecting very poor judgment, flaunting of rules and\nregulations, and inadequate self-control. He knowingly and voluntarily participated in\nevery incident of security concern, and failed to take necessary steps to change the\ncircumstances under which his problems recurred until fairly recently. It has been less\nthan a year since his most recent incident, and he remains on a company monitoring\nprogram until 2012. The inpatient and intensive outpatient supervision by others that he\n\n9\nhas undergone since January 2009 lessens the degree to which his recent good\nbehavior can be attributed to his own remorse and rehabilitation. While evidence of an\nexcellent start toward establishing rehabilitation was presented, including his recent\noutstanding work performance, lifestyle changes, and abstinence from alcohol, it is too\nsoon to confidently conclude that continuation or recurrence of his alcohol problems are\nunlikely. He made insufficient showing of reduced potential for pressure, exploitation, or\nduress, especially should a future relapse put his continued employment in jeopardy. \nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Although his recent efforts have\nbeen commendable, he has not yet met his burden to mitigate the security concerns\narising from his alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Altenburg, Jr., Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 9, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider\nsignificant record evidence favorable to Applicant; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a military retiree\nseeking a security clearance as an employee of a Government contractor.  While in the military he\nperformed security and criminal investigations.\nApplicant\u2019s son is married to a citizen of Russia.  They met in a U.S. graduate school.  The\ntwo were married in a civil ceremony in the U.S. and in a religious ceremony in Russia.  A\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant\u2019s daughter-in-law is also a citizen and resident of Russia.  Her\nfather is a retired official of the former Soviet Union who, during his government career, participated\nin a Soviet intelligence organization and worked to undermine U.S. security interests.  \nApplicant visited Russia to attend the wedding ceremony, and he stayed in an apartment and\nin a vacation home of his son\u2019s father-in-law.  He subsequently paid two other visits to Russia, in\nthe late 2000s.  In making these visits, Applicant complied with U.S. Government reporting\nrequirements.  Prominent individuals in the Defense community recommend Applicant for a security\nclearance.  \nAlthough the U.S. and Russia share strategic interests, the relationship between the two\ncountries has been strained by Russian involvement in Georgia, threats against Poland, killings of\nRussian journalists, and the country\u2019s use of oil as a means of political pressure against Ukraine,\nLithuania, and the Czech Republic.  Russia has targeted U.S. technologies and has sought protected\ninformation through industrial espionage.  It has provided missile technology to China, Iran, Syria,\nand Venezuela, which can be used in constructing weapons of mass destruction.  The Russian\nMinistry of Internal Affairs and Federal Security Office monitor internet and e-mail traffic.  Russian\nlaw enforcement agencies have access to personal information of telephone users.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider record evidence which he believes to be\nfavorable to his case for mitigation.  For example, he argues that the father-in-law\u2019s notoriety\nmilitates against his serving as a means through which Applicant might be pressured to compromise\nU.S. security interests.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.\n\n3\nThe decision reflects that the Judge considered the entire record and that she provided a reasonable\ninterpretation of the evidence.  Applicant points to his prior good security record as a factor that\nmitigates the security concerns in his case.  Applicant\u2019s security record is evidence that the Judge\nwas obliged to consider.  The Judge refers to that record several times in the Decision.  This is a\nclose case, and as such the Judge was obligated to resolve it in favor of national security rather than\nin favor of Applicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-12088 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2007).  The\nGovernment need not wait until an individual mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information\nbefore it can make an unfavorable security clearance decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-00435\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2009), citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D. C. Cir. 1969), cert.\ndenied 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).   \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision, both as to her application of the mitigating\nconditions and the whole-person factors.  In light of Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s presence in Russia and his\nfamily circumstances there, we conclude that the Judge articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

At the hearing, he introduced three exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A, \nB, and C and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on September 3, 2009. \n                                                    \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG B, Foreign \nInfluence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all \nfour allegations and provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nadmitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and the applicable adjudicative guideline, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 61 years old and a native-born U.S. citizen. He is married and the \nfather of an adult son who is 32 years old. Applicant seeks a security clearance as a \ncivilian government contractor. In 2003, he retired after 30 years of military service with \na distinguished record in security and criminal investigations that included numerous \nhigh-level commendations, awards, and certificates of appreciation. In 2005, he was \ndiagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease.  (Ex. 1; Ex. A; Tr. 43-91, 112.)  \n \n \nApplicant was first granted a security clearance in 1970. He held a security \nclearance without incident until 2002. In 2002, his eligibility for access to a higher level  \nclearance was revoked because of security concerns related to his son\u2019s wife\u2019s \nnationality and family connections and the country where his son now resides. Applicant \nretired from military service in 2003.  (Ex. 1 at 9; Ex. 5; Tr. 33-38, 137-138.) \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant learned that his son was romantically involved with a Russian \nwoman. The son and the woman met as graduate students at a U.S. university. They \nwere married in a civil ceremony in the United States in October 1999. Applicant and his \nwife strongly disapproved of the marriage, and they did not attend the civil ceremony. \nThey felt that their son had deceived them about his relationship with the Russian \nwoman.  (Ex. A: son\u2019s statement; Tr. 115-117.)   \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia. She is also a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. The daughter-in-law\u2019s father is a retired high-level officer in a \nRussian military intelligence organization, who worked to undermine U.S. security \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \ninterests by \u201cmanaging\u201d or \u201chandling\u201d individuals who divulged U.S. classified \ninformation to the Russians.  (Ex. A: daughter-in-law\u2019s statement; Tr. 119-121, 126.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son and his wife have two young children, one born in the United \nStates in 2000, and the other born in Russia in 2006. Both children are dual citizens of \nthe United States and Russia. Applicant\u2019s son and daughter-in-law reside in Russia with \ntheir two children. The older grandson attends a Russian elementary school. Applicant\u2019s \nson and his family live in the same neighborhood as Applicant\u2019s daughter-in-law\u2019s father \nand mother. Applicant\u2019s son resides in Russia under a visa granted to him by the \nRussian Government. (Ex. A: son\u2019s statement; Ex. A: daughter-in-law\u2019s statement; Ex. B \nat 7; Tr. 139-140, 152-159.)   \n \n \nIn the summer of 2000, Applicant\u2019s son and daughter-in-law traveled to Russia to \nmarry in a religious ceremony, to visit her family, and to introduce them to their newborn \nson. Applicant, who was serving in the U.S. military, traveled to Russia on personal \nleave to witness the religious ceremony uniting his son and his daughter-in-law in \nmarriage. Applicant\u2019s wife, who is estranged from their son, did not join him in the \nRussian trip, and she did not attend the wedding. Applicant informed his chain of \ncommand of the trip and complied with all U.S. government foreign travel reporting \nrequirements.  (Ex. A: son\u2019s statement; Ex. A: daughter-in-law\u2019s statement; Tr. 115-117, \n151.) \n \n \nWhile in Russia in 2000, Applicant elected not to stay in a hotel, but instead \nstayed in the apartment and vacation home of his daughter-in-law\u2019s father, who had \nretired from his government position in 1991.1 In his retirement, the daughter-in-law\u2019s \nfather owns a security business in Russia. While Applicant was a guest of his daughter-\nin-law\u2019s parents, their vacation home burned. Arson was not the cause of the fire. \nAlthough they had originally planned to return to the United States after the religious \nceremony, Applicant\u2019s son and daughter-in-law decided to remain in Russia to provide \nmoral support to her parents. Applicant\u2019s son obtained a job with a U.S. government \nentity in Russia.2 (Ex. A: daughter-in-law\u2019s statement; Tr.117-119, 121, 147-148.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son, daughter-in-law, and older grandson came to the United States \nin the summer of 2006 so that the daughter-in-law could take part in a naturalization \nhearing as a part of her application for U.S. citizenship.3 Applicant saw his son and his \n \n1 Applicant reported that during this time, he was also a dinner guest at the vacation home of a friend of \nhis daughter-in-law\u2019s parents. The family friend had also served in high-level security and diplomatic \npositions for the former Soviet government. (Ex. 5 at 6.) \n \n2Later, when the identity of the son\u2019s father-in-law became clear, he was terminated from this job. He now \nworks for a private European company in Russia. (Tr. 128-132.) \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s wife received U.S. citizenship under a program for spouses of U.S. government \nemployees working outside the United States. (Ex. A at 21.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfamily at that time, but his wife did not. Applicant\u2019s son and his family have not been in \nthe United States since that visit. (Ex. B at 1;Tr. 154-159.)  \n \n  \nApplicant also traveled alone to Russia in 2007 and 2008 to visit his son and his \nfamily. Applicant\u2019s son, his wife, and their children reside at certain times with her \nparents in the parents\u2019 vacation house. During his 2007 visit, Applicant stayed in his \nson\u2019s apartment and was a guest for several days at his daughter-in-law\u2019s father\u2019s \nvacation house. When he returned to the United States, Applicant reported his activities \nand complied with all U.S. government reporting requirements. Applicant\u2019s wife, who \nremains estranged from their son, did not accompany Applicant on these trips. (Ex. B at \n7; Tr. 112-113, 158.) \n \n \nApplicant sees himself as the significant familial link with his son. When his son \nwas newly married and still in graduate school, he needed money. Applicant did not \nwant his son to turn to his Russian father-in-law for financial support, so he took \napproximately $17,000 from his 401(k) plan and gave it to his son. (Tr. 107-108, 151-\n158.) \n \n \nApplicant speaks with his son by telephone about twice a month. He does not \nspeak with his grandchildren because they do not speak English well. Their first \nlanguage is Russian. (Tr. 113.)  \n \n \nApplicant does not send money to his son in Russia. Applicant owns no property \nin Russia, and he has no accounts with Russian banks. He describes his relationship \nwith his son\u2019s father-in-law as that of \u201c[t]wo proud grandfathers.\u201d (Ex. B at 8;  Tr. 113-\n114.) \n \n \nTwo retired generals who had worked closely with Applicant when he was a \nmilitary investigator testified credibly on his behalf. They praised his skill, leadership \nability, managerial expertise, and unblemished patriotism. They recommended that he \nbe granted a security clearance, as did a third general who provided a letter of character \nreference for Applicant. (Ex. A; Tr. 46-84.) \n \n \nAt the time of his hearing, Applicant was not employed. He was dismissed by his \nprevious employer after he fell in the workplace and his employer concluded that his \nParkinson\u2019s disease was making it difficult for him to carry out his job safely. However, \nthe government contractor that sponsored his application for a security clearance \ncontinued to sponsor his application. (Tr. 135-137.)  \n \n   \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Russia, which appear in \nofficial U.S. government publications: \n \n \nThe United States and Russia share certain common strategic interests. Of \nmutual interest to the United States and Russia are counterterrorism and the reduction \nof strategic arsenals.  Russia and the United States share a common interest in \ncontrolling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthem.  The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CRT) program was launched in 1992 to \nprovide for the dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet \nUnion. The CRT program was renewed in 2006 for seven years, until 2013. (HE I: \nBackground Note: Russia, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, U.S. Department \nof State, April 2009, at 13.) \n \n \nSince 2003, U.S.-Russian relations have often been strained. Tensions between \nthe United States and Russia increased in August 2008 when Russia sent its army \nacross an internationally recognized boundary in an attempt to change by force the \nborders of Georgia, a country with a democratically-elected government. Russia\u2019s \nassault on Georgia followed other troubling signs: threats against Poland, including the \nthreat of nuclear attack; suspicious poisonings and killings of journalists and those \ndeemed \u201cundesirable,\u201d including the President of Ukraine; the apparent use of energy to \napply political pressure against Ukraine, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic; and the \ncreation in Russia\u2019s state-controlled media of an \u201cenemy image\u201d of the United States. \n(HE I: Summary at 2.)   \n \n \n \nSince at least 1997, Russia has targeted U.S. technologies and has sought to \nobtain protected information from them through industrial espionage. Russian \nespionage specializes in military technology and gas and oil industry expertise. (HE I: \nSummary at 3.) \n \n \nIn addition to its technology collection and espionage activities against the United \nStates, Russia supports missile programs and nuclear and biotechnology projects in \nother countries. Russia has provided missile technology to China, Iran, Syria, and \nVenezuela. These technologies can be used in the construction of weapons of mass \ndestruction.  Despite U.S. concerns, Russia has refused to cease constructing nuclear \nreactors in Iran. (HE I: Summary at 3.) \n \n \nRussia\u2019s internal problems include terrorism and a poor human rights record.  \nThe U.S. Department of State has warned U.S. citizens of safety concerns related to \ntravel in Russia.  (HE I: Summary at 4.) \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State reports allegations that Russian government \nofficials and others conduct warrantless searches of residences and other premises and \nelectronic surveillance without judicial permission. This surveillance includes Ministry of \nInternal Affairs and Federal Security Office monitoring of internet and e-mail traffic.  \nAdditionally, Russian law enforcement agencies have legal access to the personal \ninformation of users of telephone and cell phone services.  (HE I: Summary at 5.) \n    \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Russia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Russia, as well as the dangers existing in Russia. Russia is a \ndiplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both \ncountries have mutual interests. For example, Russia is a key partner in efforts to \nreduce proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and control of nuclear materials.   \nHowever, Russia is also one of the world\u2019s most aggressive nations in the collection of \nU.S. intelligence and sensitive economic information. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts of Applicant\u2019s case raise security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(i).4  \n \n \nThe United States is a primary intelligence target of Russia. American citizens \nwith immediate family members who are citizens or residents of Russia could be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s only child is married to a Russian citizen and has resided in Russia \nwith her for the past nine years. The couple has two young children who also reside in \nRussia and are dual citizens of Russia and the United States. In order to reside and \n \n4 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(i) reads: \u201cconduct, especially \nwhile traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or \ncoercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country.\u201d  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwork in Russia, Applicant\u2019s son relies on a visa granted him by the Russian \ngovernment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s son\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nRussia. They live near Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s family in Russia. Applicant\u2019s son sees his \nfather-in-law and mother-in-law frequently. The father-in-law is retired and owns a \nsecurity company in Russia. During his career before retirement, he carried out high- \nlevel intelligence work against the United States for the Russian government. \nApplicant\u2019s son shares his home with his wife, who has close familial relationships with \nher father and mother. \n \nIn 2000, 2007, and 2008, Applicant traveled to visit his son and his family in \nRussia. During at least two of these visits, Applicant elected to stay in his son\u2019s father-\nin-law\u2019s home and had friendly familial contacts with him. These facts raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(i). \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. If \u201cthe foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. \nGovernment business or are approved by the cognizant security authority,\u201d then AG \u00b6 \n8(d) might apply. If the \u201cindividual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(e) might apply. \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant, who had devoted his career in the U.S. military to intelligence \nand investigations, learned that his only child was involved in a romantic relationship \nwith and planned to marry the daughter of a retired high-level Russian intelligence \nofficer who had worked to undermine U.S. security interests. Applicant and his wife \nwere deeply opposed to their son\u2019s marriage to the Russian woman. As an expression \nof their opposition and lack of support, they did not attend the couple\u2019s civil marriage \nceremony, which was held in the United States. \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant\u2019s son, his Russian wife, and their infant son traveled to \nRussia to visit the wife\u2019s parents and to take part in a religious ceremony celebrating \ntheir marriage. Applicant and his wife were invited to attend the ceremony in Russia. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, who was and continues to be estranged from the son, did not attend. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant took personal leave from his active duty military responsibilities and traveled \nalone to Russia to meet his son\u2019s parents-in-law and to attend the couple\u2019s religious \nmarriage ceremony. While in Russia, he elected not to reside in a hotel but to accept \nthe bride\u2019s family\u2019s invitation to reside with them in their apartment and in their vacation \nhome. Additionally, he joined the family in dining with a former Russian intelligence and \ndiplomatic agent who was their friend. He complied with all security requirements for \nreporting his trip and foreign contacts.  \n \nApplicant sees himself as the only familial link with his son and grandchildren. He \nis a loving, loyal, and devoted father and grandfather. He speaks with his son by \ntelephone about twice a month. He is unable to speak with his grandchildren because \ntheir first language is Russian and they know little English. In 2007 and 2008, while \nemployed as a government contractor, he took personal leave and traveled alone to \nRussia to visit his son and his family. In 2007, he again resided in his son\u2019s father-in-\nlaw\u2019s vacation home with his son, the son\u2019s wife, his grandchildren, and his son\u2019s \nparents-in-law. Despite the father-in-law\u2019s past history of taking actions that seriously \nthreatened U.S. security, Applicant described his relationship with his son\u2019s father-in-law \nas that of \u201ctwo proud grandfathers.\u201d Applicant complied with all security requirements for \nreporting his trip and foreign contacts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his son are not casual or infrequent. To the contrary, \nthey are frequent, intense, and familial. His relationship with his son\u2019s Russian father-in-\nlaw is intense, risk-laden, and familial; it is framed by an awareness that the father-in-\nlaw carried out espionage against the United States, and Applicant knows that he and \nthe Russian hold opposing views on the nature and role of government. At the same \ntime, they are grandfathers to the same children. This relationship raises a concern that \nApplicant could be targeted for exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the government of \nRussia in ways that might also threaten U.S. security interests. Moreover, even though \nApplicant has been described by credible witnesses as a man who has demonstrated \nover a long period of time unquestionable loyalty and patriotism, the facts of this case \nraise conflict of interest concerns that go to the heart of family loyalties and the parent-\nchild relationship so compellingly that it is not possible to conclude that Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve such conflicts in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplicant was forthright, prompt, and candid in complying with existing agency \nsecurity requirements for reporting his Russian contacts when he traveled to visit his \nson and his family in Russia. I conclude that AG \u00b6 8 (e) applies to the facts of his case. \n  \nHowever, Applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s allegations that his contacts \nwith his son, a resident of Russia,  his daughter-in-law, a citizen and resident of Russia, \nand his son\u2019s father-in-law, a resident and citizen of Russia and a former high-level \nRussian intelligence agent, created a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships \nwith these individuals could force him to choose between loyalty to his son and \ngrandchildren and the security interests of the United States. (ISCR Case No. 03-15485 \nat 4-6 (App. Bd. June 2, 2005); ISCR Case No. 06-24575 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007))  I \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconclude that the mitigating conditions identified under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d) \ndo not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen and a mature adult of 61 years of age. He had an \nexemplary military career and served his country with great distinction. After he retired, \nhe was stricken with a debilitating illness. Even so, he continued in his efforts to use his \nexperience, skills, and knowledge to serve his country, and he sought a security \nclearance as a government contractor. \n \nApplicant is also a parent, and he is devoted to his only child, a son who is now  \n32 years old, married, living in Russia, and the father of two small children. In 1999, the \nson became romantically involved with a Russian citizen whose father, also a Russian \ncitizen, had carried out certain intelligence actions that undermined U.S. security \ninterests. Applicant and his wife vigorously opposed the match, but the son married the \nwoman and moved to Russia to live with her and their children in the orbit of the wife\u2019s \nfather. It was a choice that appeared to stand in direct opposition to Applicant\u2019s 30 years \nof honorable and patriotic service in the U.S. military.    \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThroughout history, a father\u2019s conduct and choices have sometimes adversely \naffected the lives of his children. This case reverses the historical pattern. Whether \nintended or not, the choices made by Applicant\u2019s son have not only limited his father\u2019s \ncareer but they have also increased his vulnerability and his father\u2019s vulnerability to \npressure or coercion by an aggressive foreign government that targets U.S. security \ninterests. Applicant\u2019s actions to maintain close contact with his son, to travel to Russia \nto visit him, to reside with him in Russia, and to accept the possibly compromising \nhospitality of his son\u2019s father-in-law raise serious unmitigated security concerns about \nhis vulnerability to coercion, even as they also bear poignant witness to his parental \ndevotion and attentiveness.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under AG  B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n                                                Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated September 4, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On December 5, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 29, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on April 22, 2009.  It was transferred to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on May 5, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 2, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 23, 2009.  The Government offered six exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered no exhibits.  However, the Applicant called nine witnesses and also\ntestified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on July\n23, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.\nThe Applicant submitted four Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-\n\n2\nHearing Exhibit 1 through 4.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on June\n30, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nher testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 50 years old and has a high school\ndiploma and two years of junior college.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an\nAdministrative Assistant for Human Resources and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, namely that\nshe was indebted in the amount of approximately $55,000.00 for federal and state tax\nliens.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated September 22, 2007, November 10, 2008,\nand June 19, 2009, collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the SOR.\n(Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6).  The Applicant has been employed for a defense\ncontractor since August 2007.\nThe Applicant explained that a series of unexpected circumstances caused or\ncontributed to her delinquent back taxes.  A divorce in 1987, a job lay off in 1992,\nunexpected capital gain taxes due to a house sale in the 90's, a failed business venture\nin the 90's, and a serious car accident in 2006, caused her serious financial setbacks.\nWhen she sold her house, she used the profits from the house to purchased a spa\nbusiness with the hopes of starting a new career.  At the time, she was also required to\npay her ex-husband child support.  With job instability, the state of the economy and its\neffect on her new business, the business failed and was ultimately repossessed.  The\nApplicant did her best to pay her child support payments, but ultimately fell behind.\nUnbeknowst to her, she also acquired capital gains tax on the sale of the house that she\ndid not have the money to pay.  Both federal and state tax liens were filed against her\nfor back taxes owed. \nIn May 1999, a state tax lien was filed against her in the amount of $7,519.00.  In\nMarch 2004, the state tax authority started garnishing her wages in the amount of\napproximately $10,569.00.  In February 2000, a Federal Tax lien was filed against the\nApplicant in the amount of approximately $35,551.00.\n\n3\nThe Applicant explained that although it has taken her a long time to resolve her\ndebts, she has always been willing to pay them.  She moved in with her mother to\nreduce her expenses and free up money to pay her taxes.  Her state taxes are now paid\nin full.  She contacted the state and made payment arrangements of $360.00 monthly\nthat were automatically paid from her bank account.  The levy was released at that time,\nand the debt was paid in full in November 2005.  (Tr. pp. 91-92 and Applicant\u2019s Answer\nto the SOR).\nShe still owes approximately $32,000.00 in Federal back taxes.  (Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit 4).  In November 2007, she tried to set up a payment plan with the\nIRS, but they found it unacceptable because the Applicant\u2019s earnings were too low.  Her\nattorneys are currently working to negociate a reduction of the current balance down to\nan amount that may be paid in a single, lump sum payment, or combination of down-\npayment and an affordable monthly payment plan which can meet the Applicant\u2019s\nbudgetary restrictions.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).  She is currently paying\n$50.00 every two weeks to the IRS toward her back taxes.  This will continue until she\nhas reaches a formal agreement with the IRS.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 3 and\n4).   \nBetween her income tax refunds, her garnishments and her voluntary payments,\nshe believes that she has paid between $15,000.00 and $20,000.00 toward her back\ntaxes.  She testified that her initial federal tax assessment was about $17,000.00 and\nher debt would have been paid off, had it not been for penalties and interest.  \nSeveral other unexpected events occurred that interrupted her work and\nnegatively effected her income.  For a period, the Applicant stopped working to take\ncare of her daughter, who experienced two separate high risk pregnancies.  In October\n2006, the Applicant was broadsided by an Army transport vehicle and her car was\ntotaled.  The matter is currently in litigation.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).  In the\ninterim, she had to borrow money from her mother to purchase another vehicle, and has\nbeen slow at making payments toward her federal taxes.  The Applicant had expected\nthe litigation to settle by May 2009, and had planned to use the money to pay her taxes.\n \nNine witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  Each of them had favorable\nthings to say about the Applicant\u2019s character.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a retired Staff Sergeant, testified that the Applicant is\nhonest, trustworthy and a person of high integrity.  She performs her job in a timely and\nmost efficient manner.  (Tr. pp. 77-82).  \nBoth the Applicant\u2019s son and daughter testified concerning their mothers\ncharacter.  They consider her to be a patriot, who is honest, kind, trustworthy,\nresponsible and well respected.  (Tr. P. 60-72). \nHer ex-husband, a retired police officer, testified that the Applicant is more than\nqualified for her position with the Government, that she is a fine representative, and he\nhas no hesitation recommending her for a position of trust.  (Tr. p. 54). \n\n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s mother testified that the Applicant has lived with her from 2003\nthrough 2007, that the Applicant has at times worked two jobs in order to make ends\nmeet.  She also confirmed the car accident in October 2007, which totaled the\nApplicant\u2019s car.  (Tr. pp. 66-68).\nThe Applicant\u2019s former business partner and past employer, who sold the spa\nbusiness to the Applicant and who also repossessed it from the Applicant, testified.  The\nwitness states, the Applicant is responsible, reliable and trustworthy, even though she\nhad an unfortunate outcome with her business venture.  (Tr. pp. 37-42).\nLong time friends, neighbors, and coworkers of the Applicant stated that the\nApplicant is honest and straightforward.  She is also very giving and sincere.  She can\nbe relied upon without concern otherwise.  (Tr. p. 30-33 and 56-60). \nA letter from a friend and coworker of the Applicant attests to her trustworthiness,\nhonesty, professionalism and integrity.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances:\n\n5\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence also shows that circumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol contributed to her financial indebtedness.  Until her divorce, the Applicant\u2019s\ncredit was in good standing.  Her divorce, job lay-off, failed business venture and\nunexpected capital gains tax assessment, due to the sale of her house, all contributed\nto her tax problems.  Since then, she has worked hard to resolve her indebtedness.\nShe has completely resolved her state tax liability by making regular monthly payments\nto resolve it.  She is making regular monthly payments to the IRS and reduced her\nfederal tax liability.  She plans to resolve the debt completely as soon as her lawsuit is\nsettled.  She has moved in with her mother to further reduce her overhead.  Under the\ncircumstances, the Applicant has done her best to be responsible and has made a good\nfaith effort to resolve her debts.  She realizes that she must live within her means and\nmust always pay her bills on time.  In the event that she has any future financial\nproblems, her security clearance would immediately be in jeopardy.  Considering all of\nthe evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nUnder Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\n\n7\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, her\nfavourable character references and the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or\nother characteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  The Applicant has\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her\ndebts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She also lacked health insurance for several years. Her parents provided financial support during this period of time.2 In February 2002, Applicant and her then husband filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy protection. Their bankruptcy debts included the debts listed SOR allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.ee (mortgage).

She submitted\na notarized, written response to the SOR allegations on November 16, 2008, and\nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on March 24, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on March\n30, 2009. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not submit a response or\nadditional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on June 11, 2009. The\ngovernment submitted 11 exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-11 and admitted\ninto the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and admitted as\nItem 4.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.kk and1.mm through 1.oo of the SOR. She denied the factual allegations in\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.ll and 2.a of the SOR.\nApplicant, who is 31 years old, works as a claims analyst for a Department of\nDefense contractor, a position she has held for two years. She graduated from high\nschool in 1997. She married in 1998 and separated in 2004. She has three children,\nages 12, 9 and 5, who live with her.1\nFollowing her separation, Applicant worked less than full time at one job and had\nsignificant periods of unemployment until April 2007, when she obtained her present\nemployment. She also lacked health insurance for several years. Her parents provided\nfinancial support during this period of time.2\nIn February 2002, Applicant and her then husband filed for Chapter 13\nBankruptcy protection. Their bankruptcy debts included the debts listed SOR\nallegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.ee (mortgage). The bankruptcy records reflect that\npayments, totaling $730, were made on two accounts with the creditor in allegation 1.d.\nand payments were made to the creditor in 1.ee. Payments are not shown for the two\nremaining debts. The court dismissed the bankruptcy action in August 2005 after\nApplicant\u2019s husband stopped making the required payments.3\nThe SOR lists 17 debts, totaling $3,557, for medical bills with the local\ngovernmental authority. Applicant indicates that her state income taxes are garnished\neach year to pay these debts. She has not provided documentation which supports her\n\nItem 1; Item 6; Item 7; Item 8; Item 9.\n4\nId.\n5\nItem 6; Item 8; Item 10. \n6\nItem 7; Item 8; Item 9.\n7\nItem 4; Item 5; Item 6.\n8\n3\nstatements. Applicant incurred these debts between 2001 and 2003. She also incurred\nthree other medical debts, totaling $910, in the same period of time.   \n4\nApplicant incurred five other unpaid medical bills, totaling $1,009, between 2005\nand 2007. With the exception of the mortgage foreclosure and the debt in allegation\n1.d, Applicant incurred additional unpaid debts totaling $5,885 between 2001 and\nDecember 2006. During the investigative interview, Applicant indicated she reached a\nsettlement with the creditor in allegation 1.aa. She agreed to pay $25 a month and\nanticipated the debt would be paid by early 2008. She has not provided proof of this\npayment plan and her compliance.5\nApplicant and her husband defaulted on their mortgage after they separated.\nApplicant does not know if the property was sold at foreclosure or the current status of\nthe property. She paid her mortgage during the bankruptcy. She has not provided\nfurther documentation about this debt.6\nApplicant states that her financial situation is much improved. The most recent\ncredit report indicates that in the last 15 months, she has not incurred new unpaid debts\nand that since about 2006, her unpaid debt accumulation has slowed considerably. She\nhas not provided documentation showing her current income and expenses nor has she\nprepared and submitted a budget.  \n7\nWhen she completed her SF-85P, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the following\nquestion:\nQuestion 22: Your financial Record\nb. Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial\nobligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the\nfederal government,\nApplicant denies intentional falsification of her answer. She listed her 2002\nbankruptcy filing in response to Question 22, subpart a. She also indicated that she had\nnot received any bills from creditors.  \n8\n\n4\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\n  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt during\nher marriage and has been unable to pay these obligations. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose during her marriage and resulted in a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing. She and her husband made payments under the wage\nearners plan for a period of time, but then stopped. Applicant and her husband are no\nlonger together and her finances appear to be improving. Even with these facts, I do not\nfind this mitigating condition applicable because her financial problems did not arise\nunder unusual circumstances. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose during her marriage and increased once she and\nher husband separated. She had erratic employment for several years and no medical\ninsurance. There is no indication her husband provides her with financial support or is\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n9\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n6\nhelping to resolve these debts. Her current finances are managed, but her past debts\nare still unpaid. I find this mitigating condition has some applicability in this case. \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control \u201c\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Applicant has not received financial counseling nor has she\nprovided evidence that these debts are resolved. Her current bills are being paid, but\nnot her past bills. These mitigating conditions are not applicable. Likewise, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e)\nand 20(f) are not applicable as Applicant has not challenged the validity of her debts\nwith the creditors or received a sudden influx of income.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\nFor AG \u00b6 16(A) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from her SF-85P when\nshe answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 22b about past due debts. This information is material\nto the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to her\nhonesty. In her response to the FORM, she denies, however, that she had an intent to\nhide information about past finances. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not\nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the\n9\n\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating\n10\ncondition AG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would\napply as the allegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n7\ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer was deliberate.\nWhen she completed her SF-85P, Applicant listed her 2002 bankruptcy filing,\nwhich indicated a past debt problem. She denied any other old debts because she had\nnot received any bills from her old creditors. Based on this information, the government\nhas not established Applicant had an intent to conceal financial information. Guideline\nE is found in favor of Applicant.10\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant married very young. She\nand her husband quickly incurred significant debts. They filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy protection and participated in the wage earners repayment plan for a period\nof time. They, however, did not complete the repayment plan. Many of the debts listed\nin the SOR are for medical treatment and are not included in the bankruptcy action.\nFollowing her separation, Applicant encountered difficulty in finding employment. She\nworked sporadically and relied on her parents to provide financial support until she\nfinally obtained steady employment in 2007. She has managed to pay her current bills,\nbut has not provided any proof that she has resolved any of the debts listed in the SOR.\nWithout a financial statement, I am unable to determine if she has sufficient additional\n\nI note that the debts listed in SOR allegations 1.a through 1.gg are barred from collection under state\n11\nlaw. Because Applicant continued to incur unpaid debt until January 2008, she has shown a pattern of\npoor debt payment for a long period of time, not just a window of time. \n8\nincome to pay her debts as she has three children to raise. In light of the information on\nher SF-85P, she has not intentionally falsified her trustworthiness application.11\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her\nfinancial considerations, but has mitigated trustworthiness concerns related to her\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraph 1.a -1.oo:\n  Against Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\n  Subparagraph 2.a :\n  For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                                                     \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted Answers to the SOR on April 24, 2009, and before June 19,\n2009, and requested that a decision be made without a hearing.  Department Counsel\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on August 13, 2009. The\nApplicant received the FORM on August 18, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any\nadditional information. The Applicant did not submit any additional information. The case\n\n2\nwas assigned to another administrative judge on October 15, 2009. It was reassigned to\nme on November 10, 1009. Based upon a review of the written record, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48 and single.  He retired in 2000 after a 20 year career with the\nArmy. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance\nin connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nis financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Applicant admits subparagraphs 1.a., 1.d., 1.g., 1.k., and 1.m. of\nthe SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denied\nsubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.l.

It is noted that Item 8, which was supplied\nto the Applicant with the FORM, is a full-data credit report, which contains contact\ninformation for the creditors alleged in the SOR, with noted exceptions.  The Applicant\u2019s\nresponses to the thirteen allegations in the SOR follow.\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\ntelephone bill in the amount of $221 since January 2003. The Applicant has made no\nrecent payments on this debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to make\npayments on this debt.\n1.b.\nThe Applicant denies that he is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\ncable bill in the amount of $386 since June 2004. The Applicant has known about this\ndebt since February 2008, when he was questioned about it. (Item 6 at 18.) He stated\non September 19, 2008, \u201cI am in process of paying this debt.\u201d (Item 6 at 4.) Contact\ninformation for this creditor is found in Item 8 at page 5. I find that this is the Applicant\u2019s\ndebt, that he has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no evidence that\nhe is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.c.\nThe Applicant denies that he is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent\ngovernment debt in the amount of $213 since November 2004. The Applicant has\nknown about this debt since February 2008, when he was questioned about it. (Item 6\nat 18.) He stated on September 19, 2008, \u201cI have attempted to get in contact with this\ncompany to set up a payment plan. Unable to reach company.\u201d (Item 6 at 8.) Contact\n\n3\ninformation for this creditor is found in Item 8 at page 10. I find that this is the\nApplicant\u2019s debt, that he has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no\nevidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.  \n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a finance agency in the\namount of $7,621 for a repossessed automobile.  The Applicant has made no recent\npayments on this debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to make payments on\nthis debt.\n1.e.\nThe Applicant denies that he is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent debt\nin the amount of $1,289 since April 2005. The Applicant has known about this debt\nsince February 2008, when he was questioned about it. (Item 6 at 18-19.) He stated on\nSeptember 19, 2008, \u201cI am trying to contact company. Do not know who this bill goes to,\nbut I am attempting to reach them to set up a payment plan.\u201d (Item 6 at 6.) Contact\ninformation for this creditor is found in Item 8 at page 12. I find that this is the\nApplicant\u2019s debt, that he has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no\nevidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.f.\nThe Applicant denies that he is indebted to a bank for a delinquent debt in\nthe amount of $1,854 since April 2005. The Applicant has known about this debt since\nFebruary 2008, when he was questioned about it. (Item 6 at 18.) He stated on\nSeptember 19, 2008, \u201cI am in the process of paying them but have not been able to get\nin touch with them yet. No contact with . . . Bank yet.\u201d (Item 6 at 3-4.) Contact\ninformation for this creditor is found in Item 8 at page 4. I find that this is the Applicant\u2019s\ndebt, that he has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no evidence that\nhe is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.g.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a second finance agency in the\namount of $6,756 for a second repossessed automobile.  The Applicant has made no\nrecent payments on this debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to make\npayments on this debt.\n1.h.\nThe Applicant denies that he is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent debt\nin the amount of $381 since February 2006.

When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\n\n6\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, or found by me, has over\n$21,000 in past due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose recently, primarily between about 2003 and 2008. In addition,\nthe Applicant failed to establish how much he has paid to any of his creditors. It is the\nApplicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his financial situation has improved.\nHe has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant submitted no evidence showing that this\nmitigating condition applies.\nThe Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  There\nis no track record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is $21,000 in debt, I cannot\nfind that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been so for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record,\nI cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation at\nthis time. \nOn balance, I conclude that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k:\n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 20. 2008, and elected to have his\ncase decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on November 24, 2008.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsubmitted supplemental information in response to the FORM.  The case was assigned\nto me on January 6, 2009.\nFebruary 11, 2009\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to (a) have used marijuana on numerous\noccasions from 1996 through 1997, (b) have used hallucinogenic mushrooms on at\nleast two occasions: in June 1999 and August 2000, (c) have used marijuana on a\nfrequent basis from September 2001 through February 2008, and (d) occasionally\npurchased marijuana from September 2001 through February 2008.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nclaimed he has no intention of using marijuana in the future, not out of concern for his\nsecurity clearance, but primarily due to his recent marriage and plans to start a family.\nHe claims no intention to resume use of hallucinogenic mushrooms, which he has\navoided for eight years.  He claims financial responsibility, a solid employment history,\nand an excellent academic record, which together reflect responsible behavior and an\nability to stay focused\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 27-year-old senior analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBetween September 1996 and 1997, Applicant smoked marijuana on a number\noccasions as a high school student.  After a brief respite from illegal substance usage,\nhe resumed his use of marijuana. Beginning in September 2001, he continued his use\nof marijuana through his college enrollment (1999 to 2003).  He smoked marijuana\n(either in pipe form or marijuana cigarette) on a weekly basis for social reasons, usually\nin his own house, or in a friend\u2019s house home (see ex. 5).\n After college, Applicant continued to use marijuana on a regular basis, as\nevidenced by his answers in his e-QIP and summary of his interview with an\ninvestigator from the Office or Personnel Management (OPM) (see exs. 4 and 5).  For\nmost of the years he smoked marijuana in college and thereafter, he used it once a\nweek on average (see ex. 5). \nThroughout the years he used marijuana, he purchased the drug every three\nmonths (on average) for his personal use (between 1/8 and 1/4 of an ounce at a time).\nApplicant last used marijuana in February 2008 and assures he has no intention of\nusing the substance again in the future.  He stresses his recent marriage and plans to\nstart a family (independent of his security clearance application) as his principal reasons\nfor making a determination not to use marijuana anymore in the future (ex. 5).  \nTo be sure, the record does not contain any documentary evidence of Applicant\u2019s\nresumption of marijuana use after February 2008. Neither does it contain any\ndocumented drug counseling or other corroborating evidence of his decision to\npermanently abstain from marijuana.  One of the friends he identified in his OPM\ninterview as a co-user is also named in his e-QIP as a person he stays in contact with\n\n3\n(compare exs. 4 and 5).   Whether this friend has any potential influence over his drug\nuse decisions is not clear.\nWhile in high school he tried hallucinogenic mushrooms once in June 1999 (see\nex. 5).  He experimented with hallucinogenic mushrooms once more (in August 2000)\nwith a friend at a girlfriend\u2019s house before giving up the drug permanently. \nIn his OPM interview, Applicant assured he never felt dependent on marijuana\nand had never sought counseling or treatment for his use of marijuana (see 5).  He\nassured he has never encountered any problems at work or at home because of his\nmarijuana use, and has never been arrested for cited for any drug-related offense (ex.\n5).  Applicant has never been drug-tested.\nApplicant is credited with an excellent academic record, and has no reported\nadverse employment notations in this administrative record (see ex. 5 and Applicant\u2019s\nsupplemental reasons to the FORM).  Applicant provided no documentation in his\nbehalf to support any further progress in the resolution of his drug usage.  He  provided\nno endorsements or performance evaluations either.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations  AG \u00b6 24.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\n\n4\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nBetween 1996 and at least February 2008, Applicant used and purchased\nmarijuana on what must be described as a regular and recurrent basis.  His admission to\nusing marijuana through February 2008, and earlier isolated instances of using\nhallucinogenic mushrooms, raises security concerns about his continued drug use.  Not\nuntil he answered questions about his prior drug use in his e-QIP in February 2008 did\nhe determine to cease all forms of illegal drug use.\nOver a 12-year period, Applicant used marijuana on a virtually continuous basis,\n(suspending his use of the substance for a two year stretch between 1997 and 1999),\nand off and on in 2007 before using the substance for a last reported time in February\n2008.  Applicant admits to purchasing marijuana occasionally to meet his personal\nneeds. With such a recurrent history of frequent marijuana use, and lacking in any\nreliable track history of abstinence, too much doubt and uncertainty exist to make safe\npredictable judgments about his ability to avoid recurrent drug involvement. \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d\nDC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(h), \u201cexpressed\nintent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to\ndiscontinue drug use.\u201d  Afforded an opportunity to respond to the FORM materials,\nApplicant clarified his drug use history and reassured his intentions to avoid marijuana\nuse in the future.   \n\n5\nJudgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s continued drug use. He has a lengthy\nrecurrent history of frequent marijuana use and less than a year of demonstrated\nabstinence.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s continuous and recurrent history use of marijuana,,\nconsiderable time in demonstrated abstinence would be required to mitigate security\nconcerns over his past use of illegal substance (mostly marijuana).  At this time, not\nenough time has elapsed to facilitate safe predictable judgments that he will not return to\nillegal drug use in the foreseeable future. \nWithout more time, documented counseling, and/or other corroborating evidence\nof Applicant\u2019s commitments to avoid marijuana in the future, pertinent mitigating\nconditions covered by AG \u00b6 24 are not available to Applicant at this time.  MC \u00b6 24(a),\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has applicability to Applicant\u2019s limited and\naged use of hallucinogenic mushrooms (twice between 1999 and 2000), but no more.  \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established no independent\nprobative evidence in this administrative record to warrant any different conclusions\nunder the whole person concept in the Directive.  He has provided no endorsements\nfrom supervisors and coworkers with his employer to soften or mitigate any of the drug\nand judgment concerns associated with his ongoing use of marijuana. His own\nassurances, while helpful, are not sufficient to draw any hard conclusions about his\noverall judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndrug use and judgment lapses, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to\nhis drug use and personal conduct issues.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect\nto the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d of Guideline H. Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 1.b by reasons of Applicant\u2019s isolated\nuse of the drug and the long passage of time.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE H: (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):         AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\n \nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n \n\n6\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s first divorce became final in 1990. His last divorce occurred in 2005. (Item 7) The SOR lists 19 delinquent debts. These debts total $115,241.75. The earliest delinquency date is 2002. Eight of these debts are owed to medical providers. Applicant\u2019s interrogatory answers admitted that he has not made payments on any of the 19 debts.

He also asserted in his three Answers to the SOR that he had medical problems in 2003, consisting of kidney problems and later a heart attack. Applicant cites unemployment as a contributing factor to his financial problems, but his SF-86 shows he was employed from March 1997 to November 2005, then unemployed, and gained new employment in November 2005 until April 2006.

On November 5, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing. Applicant submitted three Answers \nbecause the first two Answers did not respond to the allegations under Guideline E. \nApplicant requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nSeptember 17, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nOn May 12, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant \non May 14, 2009. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the file on May 22, 2009. \nApplicant did not file a Response to the FORM within the 30 day time period allowed \nthat expired on June 21, 2009. I received the case assignment on August 6, 2009. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant had to submit three Answers to the SOR because he neglected to \nrespond to SOR Paragraph 2 in his first two Answers. In his first Answer, he denied the \nallegation in Subparagraph 1.o and admitted all other allegations. In the two subsequent \nAnswers he admitted all allegations in Paragraph 1.  In his third Answer, he admitted \nthe allegations in Paragraph 2. (Items 2-6)  \n \nApplicant is 50 years old, married and divorced twice. He has five children from \nhis two marriages. Applicant\u2019s first divorce became final in 1990. His last divorce \noccurred in 2005. (Item 7) \n \nThe SOR lists 19 delinquent debts. These debts total $115,241.75. The earliest \ndelinquency date is 2002. Eight of these debts are owed to medical providers. \nApplicant\u2019s interrogatory answers admitted that he has not made payments on any of \nthe 19 debts. The file does not contain any evidence that Applicant made payments on \nhis debts or attempted to resolve them. He offered as a defense the explanation that he \nhas more debts than income. He also asserted in his three Answers to the SOR that he \nhad medical problems in 2003, consisting of kidney problems and later a heart attack. \nApplicant cites unemployment as a contributing factor to his financial problems, but his \nSF-86 shows he was employed from March 1997 to November 2005, then unemployed, \nand gained new employment in November 2005 until April 2006. Next, he lost his job \nand was employed again in September 2006. He has been employed in his current job \nsince April 2006. Applicant did not submit any evidence to support his medical \nconditions and unemployment contentions. (Items 2-6, 8-11)  \n \nApplicant answered the SF 86 Question 28, subsections (a) and (b), with \u201cNo\u201d \nresponses. Question 28.a asked Applicant if he had been more than 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt in the past seven years. Question 28.b inquired if Applicant was \ndelinquent more than 90 days on any debt currently. Applicant admitted the allegations, \nand explained he did not intentionally falsify his answer to Question 28. Applicant \nclaimed that he did not know what was on his credit report. He asserted that he may \nhave hit the \u201cskip\u201d button on the computer electronic form on both questions. (Items 2, \n6, 11) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \nfound in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially \ndisqualifying; and,   \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nFrom 2002 to the present, Applicant accumulated 19 delinquent debts, totaling \n$115,241.75 that remain unpaid or unresolved.  \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Only one mitigating condition might have \npartial applicability. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) would apply if the loss of employment were shown by Applicant to \nhave a substantial effect on his ability to repay his debts. In the past 12 years, Applicant \nhas been unemployed 11 months. He failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue. \n \nApplicant also offers his divorces as reasons for his delinquent debts, but fails \nagain to explain how a four-year-old divorce affected his current debt delinquencies. \nAgain, he failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nLastly, Applicant contends his medical problems in 2003 caused some of his \ndelinquent debt. Only eight debts were owed to medical providers, less than half the \nnumber of debts owed. Applicant failed to prove AG \u00b6 20 (b) applied because he did not \nsubmit sufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control \nand that he acted responsibly in resolving his delinquent debts during the time the debts \nwere accumulating. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not disclose his financial delinquencies as alleged in SOR \nParagraph 1. He disclaims any intentional action in doing so. Applicant could not follow \ninstructions in making his Answer to the SOR, and had to submit a total of three \nAnswers to comply with the Directive. If he had difficulty following directions with regard \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nto filing his Answer, it is reasonable to believe his explanation that he did not follow \ninstructions on the SF 86. Applicant committed an inadvertent error, not a deliberate \neffort to mislead the Government. This guideline is found in his favor. Hence, it is not \nnecessary to consider any mitigating condition.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult when he \nincurred the debts. He has not taken any action to resolve his delinquent debts. This \ninaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress based on \nthe magnitude of his financial obligation. His lack of action continues to this day, and is \nobviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based on his past performance. Applicant \ndisplayed a lack of good judgment incurring the debts.  Next, he exhibited a continued \nlack of appropriate judgment by failing to make payments on any of his delinquent debts \nduring the past seven years. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nFinancial Considerations. He did mitigate the security concerns under the guideline for \nPersonal Conduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.o: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S.

On October 29, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the\nApplicant on January 8, 2009.  The Applicant received the FORM on January 16, 2009,\nand was given 30 days to submit any additional information.  He elected not to submit\nanything further.  The case was assigned to me on March 24, 2009.  Based upon a\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 28, single, and has a college degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs.  The Applicant admitted all of the\nallegations in the SOR.  These admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe Applicant used marijuana at least 200 times from approximately December\n1998 to January 2008.  (Item 5 at question 24, Item 6 at 2-3.) He stated that the majority\nof his use occurred before June 2005.  During the period between June 2005 and\nJanuary 2008, he used marijuana approximately five or six times.  (Ibid.)\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant states that he will not use marijuana in\nthe future.  He further states, \u201cThis request for security clearance and keeping my\ncurrent job were not the driver for this change of personality.  If security clearance is not\ngranted, my position on drug usage remains the same in that it is not of value.\u201d\nHowever, he sees three associates every other week who continue to use marijuana.\nThe Applicant was arrested for Possession of Marijuana in May 2003.  He plead\nguilty to Possession of Drug Paraphernalia and paid a fine.  The Applicant maintains\nthat he did not possess marijuana on this occasion, but he admits to having a marijuana\npipe in his possession.  (Item 6 at 4.)\nHe also admitted to using LSD twice in 2000 and hydrocodone approximately five\ntimes in 2001.  He has not used either drug since that time.  (Ibid.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n3\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considered the following:  \n(a) any drug abuse; and\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nThe Applicant used marijuana on more than 200 occasions over a period of\napproximately ten years.  His last use of marijuana was within a year of the record\nclosing in this case and was three months after he filled out his e-QIP (Item 5).  He\nstates that he has stopped any use of marijuana, but based on the recency of his use, I\nfind this statement not to be credible.  I find that both of the above disqualifying\nconditions apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6\n26 and find that none of them apply to the facts in this case concerning his marijuana\nuse.  I have especially considered whether to apply the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened under\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. \n\n5\nThe Applicant\u2019s use of LSD and hydrocodone in 2000 and 2001 was minor in\nnature and has not been repeated.  This usage has no current security significance.\nAccordingly, subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c. are found for the Applicant.\nHowever, the evidence is clear that the Applicant used marijuana on a number of\noccasions over a period of years.  He used it after he was arrested in connection with its\nuse, and after he filled out his Government questionnaire, which put him on notice of the\nGovernment\u2019s concerns.  Not enough time has passed for me to say with any degree of\ncertainty that he will not use marijuana again.  He has not mitigated the security\nsignificance of this use.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a young man who\nused marijuana, an illegal substance, a considerable number of times over many years.\nIn viewing all the facts of this case, I cannot find that the Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth above, I cannot find that there\nhave been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I cannot find\nthat there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG\n\u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug\ninvolvement.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline J (Criminal Activity) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, the Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, notarized on September 9, 2008, he\nadmitted two of the four allegations raised under Guideline J and admitted the two\nallegations, with explanations, raised under Guideline E. He also requested a\ndetermination based on the written record. \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n Item 5 (Case Search Inquiry, dated Jul. 24, 2008).\n1\n In his response to the SOR, Applicant sets forth his explanation that he took possession of his passenger\u2019s\n2\ncocaine in order to protect his passenger, who had a criminal record. Applicant states that he thought his clean\nrecord would preclude his being charged for cocaine possession. Collateral estoppel applies, and Applicant\ncannot contest the validity of his felony conviction in this forum. Moreover, possession of cocaine on behalf\nof someone else does not constitute a defense to this crime.\n Item 7 (Courts Case Information, dated Jun. 26, 2008).\n3\n2\nIn response to Applicant\u2019s answer, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM), dated November 6, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nNovember 26, 2008. He declined the opportunity to submit a response to the FORM\nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM.\nThe case was forwarded to DOHA for assignment to an Administrative Judge for\nan administrative determination. The case was assigned to me on January 21, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I find it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old driver employed by a Defense contractor. Applicant\nwas married in 1994 and the couple has three minor children. Applicant also has two\nolder children from a previous relationship.\nBecause Applicant submitted a brief response to the allegations and declined a\nhearing on the record, the facts of record are scant. In April 1997, Applicant was\narrested and charged with Disturbing the Peace, Profanity, Disorderly Conduct, and\nResisting Arrest. The case was never prosecuted. Applicant has no recollection of the\nincident, remembering only an incident in which he was asked by security police to turn\ndown his music. In his materials, Applicant failed to provide any documentary evidence\nrefuting the Government\u2019s submission of records regarding the charges from a county\ndistrict court.1\nApplicant admits that in about September 1999, he was arrested and charged\nwith Driving Under The Influence (DUI). He was sentenced to pay a fine. Also,\nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. \nOn or about August 26, 2006, Applicant was charged with Possession of\nCocaine, a felony, and Using Abusive Language.  Represented by counsel, Applicant\n2\npled guilty. On or about February 5, 2007, he was convicted of Possession of Cocaine\nand sentenced to Unsupervised Probation for two years, to 100 hours of community\nservice, and to complete a drug awareness class.  \n3\nOn January 11, 2008, Applicant executed his security clearance application. That\nform included \u201cSection 23: Your Police Record-For this item, report information\nregardless of whether the record has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court\n\n Item 2 (Answer to the SOR), at 4-6.

The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the\nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order\nunder the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d With regard to subsection a.\n(\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\u201d) and\nsubsection d. (\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related\nto alcohol or drugs?\u201d), he answered \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant answered those questions in the\nnegative because it was his understanding that if he satisfied the court\u2019s sentencing\nrequirements (two years probation, community service, and completion of a drug\nawareness class) his case would be put in a hold status until February 9, 2009. As long\nas no further issues were presented, it was his understanding that the charge would be\ndismissed. Elsewhere, Applicant stated that he misunderstood the question and that,\nhad he known the conviction was on his record, he would have answered differently.4\nIn submitting his materials, Applicant limited his submissions to his response to\nthe SOR. No documentation was presented indicating his progress with regard to his\nperiod of unsupervised probation, 100 hours of community service, or completed a drug\nawareness class. No evidence was presented indicating the court has otherwise\ndropped the charges or nullified the conviction.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables comprising the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n6\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n7\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n8\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n9\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n10\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 30.\n\n5\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG\n\u00b6 15.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established\nits case. Applicant admits that he was arrested, charged, and convicted of Possession\nof Cocaine, a felony, in August 2006. As part of that disposition, on February 5, 2007,\nhe was sentenced to two years of unsupervised probation, 100 hours of community\nservice, and required to complete a drug awareness class. He also admits that he was\narrested, charged, and convicted of DUI in September 1999. Further, he failed to refute\nevidence that he was charged in 1997 with Disturbing the Peace, Profanity, Disorderly\nConduct, and Resisting Arrest. Such admissions and conduct are sufficient to raise\nsecurity concerns, invoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6\n31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d), CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d), and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(d)\n(\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) and initiate inquiry.\nThe 1997 incidents are remote in time and details are vague. Moreover, they are\nnot accompanied by charges or allegations related to drugs or alcohol which would\nprovide a nexus to the more recent convictions. Therefore, with regard to the 1997\ncharges, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time\nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies to a limited extent. \nApplicant presented no evidence that he was pressured or coerced into\nexcessively consuming alcohol in 1999 or possessing cocaine in 2006. Therefore, CC\nMC AG \u00b6 32(b) (\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life\u201d) does not apply. Moreover,\nApplicant admits to the DUI conviction and the cocaine possession charge, obviating\napplication of CC MC AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the\noffense\u201d) as to the actual offense. However, this section mitigating condition does apply\nwith regard to SOR allegation 1.d (regarding the allegation discussed below that\nApplicant falsified his security clearance application).. \nNeither alcohol abuse nor cocaine use are compatible with the professional\ndriving of vehicles utilizing the public roads and highways, nor are they compatible with\nthe maintenance of a security clearance. While nearly 10 years has passed since\nApplicant was last cited for alcohol abuse, Applicant failed to introduce any efforts\n\n6\nundertaken to rehabilitate himself following his conviction for DUI. Moreover, his\nmaintenance of a clean record following that conviction was interrupted by a cocaine\npossession charge which occurred within the past two and a half years. Further, as part\nof the adjudication of that charge, Applicant was ordered to successfully serve two\nyears of probation, complete 10 hours of community service, and complete a drug\nawareness class. Applicant failed to present evidence that any of these requirements\nhave been successfully or substantially completed. Consequently, the available record\nevidence is that the court retains jurisdiction over the matter and the matter remains\nopen. Given these facts, neither CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d) nor any remaining\nmitigating condition fully applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, examination is made of an Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information based on his past personal\nconduct and actions. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process. Applicant is cited by the Government for failing to disclose\nthat he had been charged with Possession of Cocaine, a felony, in response to Section\n23 a. and d. on his security clearance application. It alleges that Applicant\u2019s failure to do\nso was deliberate. Such facts, if true, give rise to Personal Conduct (PC) Disqualifying\nCondition (DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities).\nTo his defense, Applicant\u2019s explanation as to why he did not include this charge\nand conviction is not implausible. He stated that it was his understanding that if he\nsatisfied the court\u2019s sentencing requirements (two years probation, community service,\nand completion of a drug awareness class) his case, and no doubt his conviction, would\nbe on hold through February 2009, providing him the opportunity to fulfill the court\nordered requirements. Such a tentative arrangement could be confusing to a non-\nlawyer and its nuance difficult to absorb. Department Counsel is correct in noting that\nApplicant\u2019s diverse arguments on this matter make them suspect. That does not,\nhowever, necessarily make them not credible. Nor is there any other indication or\nevidence indicating deliberate falsity on the part of Applicant. Without an element of\nfalsity or deliberate concealment, the disqualifying condition cannot be sustained.\nApplicant has presented sufficient argument to mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns.\n\n AG \u00b6 2(b).\n11\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the\nscant facts and circumstances introduced in this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a mature man with a wife and several children. A\nprofessional driver by profession, he must be familiar with the dangers of alcohol abuse\nand drug use, both on the road and off. Similarly, he must be aware of the stigma such\nbehavior carries when associated with the driving profession and with one seeking\naccess to classified information. Although two and a half years have passed since his\narrest for cocaine possession, he has failed to show successful completion of his two\nyears of probation, 100 hours of community service, and drug awareness course. Also,\nhe has failed to show that he has continued to distance himself from drugs and other\ncriminal conduct to the satisfaction of the court retaining jurisdiction of the cocaine\npossession case, and to this tribunal\u2019s satisfaction as well.\nAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of the national security.  Because Applicant\u2019s\n11\nstatus with regard to his drug possession conviction and court ordered requirements\nremain unresolved, and not enough time has elapsed since his cocaine possession,\nsecurity concerns remain. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.c\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On July 30, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is unfair because the Judge relied on an\ninvestigative file prepared by persons who did not believe Applicant.  Applicant contends that\nmitigating evidence was not considered, and questions were not posed of the investigative body\nregarding possible weaknesses in the (unfavorable) theory of the case.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Judge found that Applicant participated in a scheme to exploit her status at a military\nexchange overseas to purchase exchange merchandise for foreign nationals ineligible to make such\npurchases.  He further found that her denials were not credible and constituted the deliberate\nprovision of false information to her employers and the investigators.  The Judge\u2019s adverse findings\nwere based on substantial evidence and are sustainable.  (See Directive \u00b6E3.1.14 and \u00b6E3.1.32.1.)\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the evidence and the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct\nand considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. Furthermore,  Applicant has not provided a\ncogent reason on appeal to disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Applicant\u2019s argument on\nappeal about questions the Judge could have asked is unpersuasive.  Applicant elected to have her\ndecision on the written record.  Thus, there was no mechanism for the Judge to ask questions.  Also,\nthe burden is on Applicant to make her case in mitigation, rebuttal or extenuation, not on the Judge\nwho is an impartial adjudicator.  (See Directive \u00b6E3.1.10, \u00b6E3.1.15 and\u00b6 E3.1.25.)\n\n3\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s employment as manager of an overseas military exchange facility\nwas terminated for her involvement in cigarette ration violations, falsifying ration and gift\ncards, and destroying ration control records to conceal the fraudulent activity. Contrary\nto substantial evidence, Applicant and her former employees admit only what was\ndirectly observed, and deny the larger fraud. Applicant\u2019s appeal of her termination and\nsubsequent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint were\nunsuccessful. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), on\nFebruary 12, 2007.  On March 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline E.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n2\nJuly 30, 2009\n\nItem 3.\n3\nThe Government submitted six items in support of the allegations.\n4\nItem 4 at 1, 2; Item 5 at 5, 7.\n5\nApplicant\u2019s responses to the SOR and to the FORM.\n6\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 12, 2009, and requested that her\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 9, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nshe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM\non June 16, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. On June 19, 2009, she submitted a letter\nwith additional evidence and some corrections to statements made by Department\nCounsel in her argument. Applicant made no objection to consideration of any evidence\nsubmitted by Department Counsel, other than to note her disagreement with some of\nthe conclusions and decisions reached by her former employers. On July 14, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel initialed a memorandum to indicate that she did not object to the\nadmissibility into evidence of the materials submitted by Applicant. Accordingly, the\nApplicant\u2019s July 13, 2009 letter and all attachments thereto are admitted into evidence\nand the record. I received the case assignment on July 21, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old former employee of a military exchange system\noverseas applying for a NATO civilian security clearance. Her father is retired from U.S.\nmilitary service and her mother is a foreign national from the country where they have\nlived since 1993. Applicant was a dual citizen until renouncing her foreign citizenship to\nqualify for employment at the exchange as a U.S. employee.5\nApplicant worked as a sales associate at the exchange from 1993 to 1998, when\nshe joined the Security (later Loss Prevention) Department as an exchange detective.\nShe performed all these duties in an exemplary manner, and received numerous formal\nawards and commendations. In 2001, she was selected to be the supervisory manager\nof a remote retail annex. All other employees at this annex were local nationals.6\nApplicant was authorized to buy exchange merchandise, but none of her employees\nwere authorized to do so.\n\nItem 6 at 1-11.\n7\nId.\n8\nItem 6 at 13-15.\n9\n3\nOn several occasions throughout the day of November 14, 2006, exchange loss\nprevention guards observed one of Applicant\u2019s local-national employees leaving the\nstore with several bags of merchandise and placing them in his car. Applicant\naccompanied the employee on one of these trips to his car. The bags contained\nexchange merchandise and purchase receipts, including a jacket, two pairs of shoes,\ntwo fruit drinks, and twelve cartons of ration-controlled cigarettes. All items except the\ncigarettes had been purchased by Applicant using her credit card, and were intended as\ngifts for the employee\u2019s children. The employee claimed two unknown American service\nmembers had agreed to his request to purchase the maximum ration of six cartons each\nof cigarettes for him. Further investigation revealed that the purchases were made with\ncash, and were recorded by another employee on the daily ration-control record (RCR)\nusing names and ration card numbers that were false. The purchases were recorded\ntogether on the RCR, but register records indicated that they were actually made at 9:22\na.m. and 1:47 p.m. on the two different registers in the store. A second employee made\nthe first sale using her regular register. She also claims that she made the second sale\non the other register while using Applicant\u2019s log-in number by mistake. Applicant denies\nhaving made the sale, or otherwise having any knowledge of her employee\u2019s purchase\nof rationed cigarettes. However, register records showed that the second employee\nmade two sales on her regular register at 1:46 p.m., one sale at 1:47 p.m., and another\nsale at 1:48 p.m. that day. Neither of the two other employees who worked that day\nrang up any register sales between 1:21 p.m. and 2:09 p.m., and both said they left the\nstore for lunch during that period. The employee caught with the contraband goods did\nnot have register privileges, so the simultaneous sales on the two registers, located\nsome 12 feet apart, were most likely made by Applicant and the second employee.  \n7\nExchange loss prevention personnel were sent to the annex on November 16,\n2006, to obtain the retained RCRs for investigation of further fraudulent names and\nration card numbers. Applicant produced the RCRs for November 15 and 16, but said\nshe had no older records because she routinely destroyed them after a few days in\norder to prevent their being modified. She said she had followed this practice for several\nyears but never sought permission or confirmation for such a procedure. She claims no\nwritten regulation requires retention of these records, although she did have past copies\nof all other required records.8\nRecords of cigarette sales at Applicant\u2019s annex were examined to determine how\noften sales of the monthly maximum of six cartons at one time were made from\nFebruary to November 2006. There were no such sales in February, 4 in March, 1 in\nApril, 2 in May, 6 in June, 16 in July, 11 in August, 8 in September, 15 in October, and\n11 in November (ending with the two on November 14). One July sale and three of the\nAugust sales fully or partially involved a brand different from the one found in the\nemployee\u2019s car. All other full-ration sales were of that same cigarette brand.9\n\nId.\n10\nItem 6 at 15-19.\n11\nId.\n12\n4\nFrom March to July 19, 2006, one full-ration purchase was made by credit card\nand all the rest were paid by cash. From July 20 to August 7, 2006, one such purchase\nwas by credit card and all of the remaining 11 full-ration purchases were made using the\nsame exchange gift card. Two of these gift-card sales were of 12 cartons, twice the\nmonthly limit. All the full-ration sales from the annex between August 8 and November\n14, 2006, were paid by cash.10\nResearch into the gift card used for the purchases in late July and early August\nrevealed that it was originally issued on July 20, 2006, at a register in Applicant\u2019s annex\nby a person using her employee log-in number (ID). Two minutes later, it was used at\nthe other register, operated by the second employee, to purchase six cartons of\ncigarettes. The following day, the card was reloaded with funds at the second\nemployee\u2019s register and six minutes later it was used at the same register to purchase\n12 cartons of cigarettes. Five days after that, the card was reloaded with funds from a\nmerchandise return recorded on the second employee\u2019s register and eight minutes later\nused again at that register to purchase 12 cartons of cigarettes. Two days later it was\nreloaded on the other register using Applicant\u2019s ID, and the next minute used to\npurchase six cartons of cigarettes on the second employee\u2019s register. This pattern\ncontinued until August 7, the last time the card was used to purchase cigarettes. On\nAugust 11, 2006, the card was used twice, once for toothpaste and a Tang drink, and\nonce for food and merchandise items. The first time it was reloaded at the second\nemployee\u2019s register under her ID and used for the purchase a minute later at the other\nregister under Applicant\u2019s ID. The second transaction was reversed, with Applicant\nreloading the card and the sale on the second employee\u2019s register six minutes later.\nNeither Applicant nor the second employee could explain why a customer would use\none register to reload money on the card, then go to the other register to make\npurchases when both transactions could be made at the same register.  \n11\nFurther research revealed that this gift card was purportedly issued to a woman\nwith a work address on the installation where Applicant\u2019s annex is located. After\nunsuccessful attempts to contact this person, it was determined that no person by that\nname was then, or had ever been, employed or been granted access to that facility.\nInvestigators concluded that this name, like those recorded on the RCR for the two\nNovember 14 full-ration purchases, was \u201cbogus,\u201d and created by members of\nApplicant\u2019s staff.   \n12\nOn August 2, 2006, four minutes after being reloaded under Applicant\u2019s register\nID, the gift card was used to purchase a 100-liter fuel allotment and six cartons of\ncigarettes on the second employee\u2019s register. Fuel is also a rationed item, requiring\nsignature receipt for a purchase and registration by social security number of the\npurchaser. The very next transaction on the second employee\u2019s register was a sale of\n\nId.\n13\nItem 6 at 19-20.\n14\n5\nanother 100 liters of fuel and one carton of the same brand of cigarettes charged to\nApplicant\u2019s credit card. The fuel receipts show that Applicant personally signed for both\nof the foregoing purchases of 100 liters of fuel coupons. The exchange records further\nshowed that the second employee had manually input Applicant\u2019s social security\nnumber as identification of the authorized purchaser for both sales. The explanations for\nthese facts offered by Applicant and the second employee in support of their claims of\nignorance concerning abuse of this gift card are not credible.13\nThe formal exchange investigation into these matters concluded that its:\nfindings strongly indicate [Applicant] has complicity in the creation and use\nof the fraudulent [exchange] gift card in the [false] name; by personally\nusing the card to purchase a gas ration and cigarettes to include signing\nthe gas receipt; the failure to retain the Cigarette Ration Control Logs,\nwhich [sic] is required as official documents. Since the RCR logs were\ndisposed of in an ongoing manner, it is also probable that [Applicant] had\nknowledge that bogus names and ration card numbers were being used to\nconceal the unauthorized sale of ration controlled cigarettes at [her] store;\nand by providing dishonest statements in an attempt to cover these events\n[sic]. The findings also show that [the employee caught with the goods]\nand [the second employee] are both complicit as well in participating in\nthese events.14\nDespite Applicant\u2019s protestations of her innocence, her employment was\nterminated based on these grounds. Her appeal, and a subsequent EEOC complaint\nwere both unsuccessful. She now admits that she should not have purchased the\njacket, shoes, and drinks for her employee\u2019s children, and should have sought\npermission to destroy the RCR documents, but considers those to be minor\ntransgressions. She submitted statements from her former employees supporting her\ngood character and denying that she had any involvement in fraudulent circumvention\nof ration control measures. Given the complicity of at least two of those employees in\nthe schemes, their assertions carry little weight. Applicant also noted that both of the\nlocal-national employees found to be complicit in the fraudulent activity were re-hired by\nthe exchange system.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that: \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n7\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying under this guideline. Department Counsel asserts only AG \u00b6 16(d) in her\nargument, but I find that four of them apply under the facts of this case:\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation;\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\n\n8\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group.\nApplicant\u2019s denials of knowledge and participation in the fraudulent violations of\ncigarette ration control measures uncovered by the exchange investigation into\noperations at her store are contrary to the great weight of the objective evidence. This is\nnot a matter about which she could be confused or forgetful. Accordingly, I find that she\ndeliberately provided false and misleading information to her former government\nemployer and its investigators. Her conduct in connection with this pattern of illegal\nintroduction of contraband into her host country, and her concealment of information\nabout it from family members and professional associates, adversely affected her\npersonal and professional standing, and created significant vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, and duress. The evidence of record thus establishes security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b) and (e).\nMy whole person analysis will be set forth below, but Applicant\u2019s participation in,\nand attempted concealment of, ration-control violations after working as a loss-\nprevention detective and having been entrusted with overseeing operations at a remote\nannex is serious. She put a 13-year career at risk for relatively minimal personal gain,\nand demonstrated her willingness to violate rules and regulations established to\nfacilitate the national security mission of the U.S. in a foreign country. Her conduct\nsupports findings of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, thereby establishing\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n9\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\n \nApplicant continues to deny and minimize her culpability. She offered no\nevidence of improper advice urging her either to mislead investigators or to engage in\nthe fraudulent breaking of regulations. The violations were increasingly frequent and\nonly stopped when Applicant and her employees were caught in the act. While her loss\nof employment makes recurrence of this particular form of smuggling unlikely, the\nevidence is insufficient to conclude that it no longer casts doubt on her reliability,\ntrustworthiness and judgment. She has not acknowledged most of her culpability,\nprecluding any finding of rehabilitation or that her vulnerability to exploitation is reduced.\nThe adverse allegations were substantially supported by the findings and conclusions of\nthe exchange investigation. Accordingly, she failed to establish mitigation of personal\nconduct security concerns under any AG \u00b6 17 provision.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n10\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her entirely voluntary choices and conduct that underlie security\nconcerns expressed in the SOR. She engaged in a clandestine scheme to violate\ncigarette ration-control measures based on treaty obligations with an allied nation, for\nher personal benefit and the benefit of at least some of her employees. She destroyed\nofficial records designed to detect such violations, and attempted to mislead\ninvestigators about the activity with false information. She provided no convincing\nevidence that she regrets having done this to the point that she would not engage in\nsimilarly wrongful behavior if entrusted with classified information. She did not disclose\nthis activity to significant people in her life, and demonstrated no reduction in her\nsusceptibility to pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress. The record contains\ninsufficient other evidence about her character, trustworthiness, or responsibility to\nmitigate these concerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Gov Ex 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. Her mother died in 2000. Applicant has five \nsiblings and maintains contact with four of them. (Tr. 24) Her older brother, two younger \nbrothers, and two younger sisters are a citizens and residents of Israel.

He is an Israeli government employee and has been such for 30 to 35 years. \n(Tr. 28) Another brother is an artist and graphic designer, and the third brother is a \ncomputer engineer, who is an Israeli government employee and has been so for 25 \nyears. (Tr. 28) This brother works for the defense ministry. (Tr. 34)  \n \nOne sister works part-time as an office worker for the Israeli equivalent of the \nsocial security administration and is an Israeli government employee. (Tr. 28) This sister \nhas been an Israeli government employee for 15 years. (Tr. 28) Her other sister is a \nbookkeeper who she has not had contact with since 2001. \n \nApplicant contacts her brothers and one sister monthly by email every month or \nevery other month and visits them in person every two years. (Tr. 37) She has no \ntelephone contact with them. (Tr. 29)  \n \nIn 1979, Applicant obtained an Israeli passport when she left Israel to allow her to \nenter and exit Israel. She renewed that passport in 1989 and 1999. (Tr. 26-27) The \npassport expires in November 2009. (Gov Ex 2) Applicant visited Israel in 2007, 2006, \n2004, 2002, 2000 when she visited her mother\u2019s grave side service. Applicant tries to go \nto Israel every two years. (Tr. 25) She visited between one week and one month on \neach trip. She used her Israeli passport on these trips and only uses it to enter or leave \nIsrael. All other travel is done on her U.S passport. (Tr. 42) Between 1984 and 1999, \nshe visited Israel every two to three years. (Tr. 26) She came to the U.S. in 1979 and \nvisited Israel in 1982, 1985, 1989, 1991, when her father died, 1994 and 1997. \n \n \nApplicant is not willing to renounce here Israeli citizenship. (Tr. 30) In September \n2007, during a personal subject interview, Applicant stated she would renounce her \nIsraeli passport if needed for her employment and security clearance because her \nemployment was most important. (Gov Ex 2) At the hearing, Applicant stated she would  \ndestroy or turn over her passport to her company security officer, if that was necessary. \n(Tr. 31) There is no evidence this was done.  \n  \n \n \nApplicant owns a home in the U.S. with a fair market value of $161,000. \nApplicant has $456,000 in her company 401(k) retirement plan. Applicant maintains a \nbank account2 in Israel that is in excess of $10,000, which she inherited from her \nmother. (Tr. 29)  \n \n \n2 The exact size of this account was not established in the record.  \n\n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 9 articulates the security concerns relating \nto foreign preference problems: \n  \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \n \nAG & 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n \n \n(1) possession and/or use of a foreign passport; \n \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in the foreign country; and \n \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n  \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States; for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United states citizenship. \n \nIn 1979, Applicant left Israel. Before she left, she obtained an Israeli passport, \nwhich she has renewed in 1989 and 1999. Her current Israeli passport, which she still \npossesses, does not expire until November 2009. Until 1984, when she became a U.S. \ncitizen, it was appropriate for Applicant to maintain her Israeli passport. Between 1984 \nand 2007, she visited Israel every two to three years. She entered and exited Israel \n\n \n \n \n6\nusing her Israel passport. Applicant asserts she can not use her U.S. passport to enter \nor exit Israel. Her only use of her Israeli passport is for travel to and from Israel. All other \ntravel is done on her U.S. passport.  \n \nDuring a 2007 personal interview, Applicant said she would surrender her Israeli \npassport if she needed to do so in order to keep her job and clearance. At the hearing, \nApplicant stated she was unwilling to surrender her Israeli citizenship, but would \nsurrender her Israeli passport if she had to in order to keep her clearance. However, the \nIsraeli passport was never surrendered.  \n \nAG & 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry; \n \n \n \n(b) individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred \nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not based \nsolely on her parent\u2019s citizenship. &11(a) does not apply. Applicant is unwilling to \nrenounce her dual citizenship. &11(b) does not apply. Her renewal and use of her Israeli \npassport occurred after becoming a U.S. citizen and as recently as 2007 when she \nvisited Israel. &11(c) does not apply. Her use of the Israeli passport is not approved by \na cognizant security authority. &11(d) does not apply. Applicant still maintains \npossession of the Israeli passport. &11(e) does not apply. There is no evidence of \nApplicant never having voted in a foreign election so &11(f) does not apply. \n \nI find against Applicant as to foreign preference because Applicant renewed her \nforeign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, used it to travel numerous times to \nIsrael, and maintains an Israeli passport, and is reluctant to renounce her Israeli \ncitizenship.  \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n\n \n \n \n7\n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is substantiated. Applicant has five siblings who are citizens and residents of \nIsrael. Applicant lives with her husband in the U.S. and her daughter is a dual U.S.\u2014\nIsraeli citizen.  \n \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information\u201d apply. \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority;  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. In 1979, Applicant left Israel and in 1984, \nbecame a U.S. citizen and obtained a secret security clearance. She has been with the \nsame employer since 1979 and her work performance has been outstanding. Between \n1984 and 2007, she visited Israel every two to three years. She entered and exited \nIsrael using her Israel passport, which she renewed it in 1989 and 1999 and which does \nnot expire until November 2009.  \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) && 8(a) does not apply except as to her sister with \nwhom Applicant no longer has contact. Applicant emails her other siblings every month \nor every other month and has personal contact every two years. In the future, she \nintends to continue visiting Israel every two or three years. Her contact with her siblings \nis neither casual nor infrequent. AG && 8(a) and 8 (c) do not apply. \n \nThe positions of her siblings must also be considered. Three of her siblings \ncurrently worked for the Israeli government and have done so for 15, 25, and 30\u201435 \nyears. Her sister works part-time as an office worker for the Israeli equivalent of the \nsocial security administration and has worked there for 15 years. Her one brother is a \nscientist researching air pollution who has been Israeli government employee for 30 to \n35 years. Another brother works as a computer engineer for the defense ministry and \nbeen an Israeli employee for 25 years. These Israeli government employees provide \nconcern.  \n \nApplicant has lived in the U.S. 29 years and lived in Israel 32 years. She owns a \nhome in the U.S. worth $161,000 and has a sizable 401(k) retirement account. She \nmaintains a bank account in Israel, which contains an amount in excess of $10,000. \nHow much in excess of $10,000 is unknown. Not knowing the value of the property in \nIsrael, I am unable to find the value of her financial interest in Israel is as minimal as it is \nunlikely to result in a conflict or could influence Applicant. I find && 8(f) and 8 (b) do not \napply.  \n \n\n \n \n \n9\n \nContact with her siblings was not the result of U.S. Government business. &&8(d) \ndoes not apply. There is no evidence as to whether Applicant has or has not promptly \ncomplied existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or \nthreats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country. && 8(e) does not \napply.  \n \n \nHer close contact with four of her siblings, three of whom work for the Israeli \ngovernment, with no applicable mitigating factors, I find against Applicant as to foreign \ninfluence.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Awhole person@ \nanalysis in a Guideline B and C case should include the totality of an applicant=s \nconduct and circumstances. \n \nAs indicated in the statement of facts, there are countervailing, positive attributes \nto Applicant=s life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting a clearance. Applicant \nhas close ties to the United States. She has had the same job for 29 year and held a \nclearance 24 years. Her closest family member is her husband, a U.S. citizen, who lives \nwith her. Her daughter, a dual U.S.\u2014Israeli citizen is married to a U.S. Naval officer \nstationed in Japan.  \n \nApplicant was born in Libya and spent her formative years and early adulthood \nliving in Israel. In 1974, she obtained her master\u2019s degree in physics in Israel. She \nworked for the Israeli Meteorological Service and for an Israeli military industry before \ncoming to the U.S in 1979, at age 32. \n \n\n \n \n \n10\nShe has five siblings in Israel, four whom she contacts regularly. She intends to \nvisit Israel every two or three years. Three of Applicant\u2019s siblings work for the Israeli \ngovernment. Her sister works part-time as an office worker for the Israeli equivalent of a \nsocial security and has worked there for 15 years. Her contact with her four siblings is \nneither casual nor infrequent. Additionally, she maintains an Israeli passport.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a -1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

She visited France in 2001, 2005 and 2006. \nSecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence are mitigated; however, security \nconcerns pertaining to foreign preference are not mitigated. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 31, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On August 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her (GE 4), pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised. The SOR alleges security \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nconcerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference).1 The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nOn September 4, 2008, the Department of Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) received Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations (GE 5). On \nSeptember 29, 2008, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. The \ncase was assigned to me on October 2, 2008.  \n \nAt the hearing held on October 16, 2008, Department Counsel offered two \nexhibits (GEs 1-2) (Transcript (Tr.) 17). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-\n2 (Tr. 17-18). Applicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 7-8). Additionally, I admitted the \nHearing Notice (GE 3), SOR (GE 4), and Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (GE 5). I \nreceived the transcript on October 23, 2008. I admitted additional documentation on \nOctober 28, 2008, to support facts regarding the French Republic section of the \nFindings of Fact (Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit  (AJ Ex.) I).  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nAfter the hearing, I decided it was appropriate to take administrative notice of \nsome basic facts concerning France, as well as about France\u2019s relationship to the \nUnited States.2 I emailed the parties, offering an opportunity to object to my \nconsideration of the contents of AJ Ex. I for administrative notice. I did not receive any \nobjections. The specific facts noticed are in the section of this opinion labeled \u201cFrench \nRepublic.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.

Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing \ninternet sources for numerous documents). In this case the source for the facts is the U.S. Department of \nState, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs August 2008, \u201cBackground Note: France,\u201d available at \nhttp://www.state.gov. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 2.a and 2.b (GE \n5). Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1981 (Tr. 3, GE 1). Eight months after \nApplicant was born, she was declared a French citizen at the French embassy (GE 2 at \n3). She has worked for a U.S. government contractor for the last 18 months (Tr. 32). \nShe provides research and budgeting for a government contractor (Tr. 32). She does \nnot require a clearance for her current position (Tr. 32). Her employer wanted her to \nperform other duties, which require a clearance (Tr. 32). She is not married and does \nnot have any children (Tr. 25). She does not share her residence with anyone (Tr. 25). \nShe attended college in Canada from 1999 to 2001 and in the United States from 2001 \nto 2006 (GE 1).4 She earned a master\u2019s degree in education in 2006 (Tr. 4, GE 1).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother was born in France in 1951, and her father was born in \nFrance in 1955 (GE 1). Her parents are naturalized U.S. citizens (GE 1). She talks to \nthem probably every other day, and she sees them on a weekly or every other week \nbasis (Tr. 22).  Her grandmother, who was a French citizen and lived in France, passed \naway in 2006 (Tr. 22, SOR \u00b6 2.c). Her brother is also a U.S. citizen (GE 1). \n \n \nApplicant has five uncles on her father\u2019s side of the family who live in France (Tr. \n23). She has other more distant relatives who live in France such as cousins (Tr. 23). \nShe had occasional direct contact, or indirect contact through her parents, with her \nfamily members living in France. She was not aware of any of her relatives living in \nFrance working for the French government or serving in the French military (Tr. 23). The \nFrench embassy in the United States has employed Applicant\u2019s mother for the past \ntwenty-five years (Tr. 23-24, SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant\u2019s mother expects to retire in the next \ntwo or three years (Tr. 24). Her mother does not hold a security clearance (Tr. 24). \nApplicant\u2019s father works for a heating and air conditioning firm in the United States (Tr. \n24).    \n \nApplicant has been employed by the U.S. government, or U.S. firms, off and on \nsince she was 16 years old (Tr. 26). She has a 401K account with her U.S. company, \nwhich contains about $3,000 (Tr. 30). She has four uncles on her mother\u2019s side of the \nfamily who live in the United States (Tr. 23).      \n \n \n \n \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.   \n \n4 During this period, she received some college credit from an internet-based educational \ninstitution while she lived overseas. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n \nForeign Preference \n  \n \nApplicant received a French passport shortly after she was born (Tr. 19). It was \nrenewed every ten years and most recently in 1999 (Tr. 18-19; SOR \u00b6 1.a). It expires in \n2009 (GE 2). She spent her summers in France, when she was in elementary school \n(Tr. 31). She used her French passport when she visited France in 2001 for two weeks, \nin 2005 for two weeks and in 2006 for ten days (Tr. 20, 23, 26-27, GE 2; SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nHer last visit to France was in 2006 for her grandmother\u2019s funeral (Tr. 23). Because of \nher French citizenship, she received reduced tuition expenses while attending college in \nCanada from 1999 to 2001 (Tr. 20, SOR \u00b6 1.c).  \n \nApplicant has not voted in any French elections (Tr. 21). She does not own any \nproperty or have any investments in France (Tr. 21-22). Her parents do own some land \nin France (Tr. 31); however, Applicant does not believe it is likely she will inherit this \nproperty (Tr. 21). Her parents have never said anything about her or her 23-year-old \nbrother inheriting this land (Tr. 21-22). \n \nApplicant retained her French passport because of her deep sense of French \nheritage (Tr. 16, 25, GE 2). At her hearing, she was unsure about whether she would \nrenounce her French citizenship and/or destroy or give up her French passport (Tr. 17, \n25, GE 2). I explained the importance of surrendering or invalidating her French \npassport, if she wanted to have a security clearance (Tr. 28-29, 35-36).  \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that she turned-in her French passport to her \nsecurity officer, destroyed it in the presence of her security officer, or otherwise \ninvalidated it. On October 27, 2008, she informed Department Counsel that she did not \nintend to renounce her French citizenship (AJ Ex. I).   \n \nFrench Republic5 \n \nFrance is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the G-8, the European Union, the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the World Trade Organization and various \nmultilateral organizations.  \u201cFrance is also America\u2019s oldest ally; French military \nintervention was instrumental in helping Britain\u2019s American colonies establish \nindependence.\u201d (AJ Ex. I at 8).  More American soldiers have been killed on French soil \n(because of World Wars I & II) than on that of any other foreign country. France \nsupports the U.S. initiative under Quartet for resolving Middle East problems. Since \n2003, France has supported four U.N. Security Council resolutions in Iraq and provided \nfunds as part of the European Union\u2014Iraq contribution. Since 2006, France has joined \nthe United States and others in actively discouraging Iran from pursuing nuclear \nweapons. \n \n \n5 AJ Ex. I is the source for the facts in this section. See also Administrative Notice, supra. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nThe U.S. State Department describes the international relationship with France \nas \u201cactive and friendly\u201d (AJ Ex. I at 10).  \u201cFrance and the United States share common \nvalues and have parallel policies on most political, economic, and security issues. \nDifferences are discussed frankly and have not generally been allowed to impair the \npattern of close cooperation that characterizes relations between the two countries.\u201d Id. \nFrance has significantly increased participation in NATO\u2019s military wing in recent years. \nId. at 9. France ended conscription in 2002 and is modernizing its military forces. Id. at \n9-10. Although France opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq, France has 2,200 soldiers \nserving in Afghanistan, and assisted in assembling $21 billion in pledges for economic \nassistance to Afghanistan. France is a close ally of the United States in the war on \nterrorism. In December 2007, France convicted five former Guantanamo detainees on \nterrorism charges.  Id. at 10. \n \nThe United States and France have strong economic relationships with each \nother. The United States is France\u2019s sixth-ranked supplier of imports. The United States \nis the top destination for French investments worldwide. The United States is the largest \nforeign investor in France, employing over 619,000 French citizens. France is the \nUnited States\u2019 eighth trading partner for total goods.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d 6 \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines C (Foreign \nPreference) and B (Foreign Influence).  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \n \n6See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his [or her] burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) describes one condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case, \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation \nof foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign \npassport.\u201d Applicant renewed her French passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. She \ncontinues to possess a French passport that will be valid until 2009, establishing AG \u00b6 \n10(a). \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. She did not invalidate or relinquish her \nFrench passport. Applicant was advised at her hearing that she could mitigate Foreign \nPreference concerns through AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e), however, she did not take action \nto effectuate these provisions.8    \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \n \n8In the decretal paragraph, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c because her receipt of \na partial reduction in tuition at a Canadian university is too minor a benefit under all the circumstances to \nestablish a foreign preference. It is simply too inconsequential in this case to merit any weight under the \nforeign preference guideline. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant has family members who are citizens and residents of France. When \nshe was in elementary school she spent some of her summers in France. She visited \nFrance in 2001, 2005 and 2006. She has occasional contact with her family members \nliving in France either directly or indirectly through her parents. She continues to \npossess a valid French passport. Applicant\u2019s grandmother, who lived in France, passed \naway in 2006. Foreign influence as a security concern is not established with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother (SOR \u00b6 2.c).   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. France and the \nUnited States have been allies since the Revolutionary War. It is very unlikely that \nFrance would put Applicant into a position where she would be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and her family members living in France. With its \nstrong human rights record, and friendly political and military relationship with the United \nStates, it is not conceivable that France would coercively target any French citizen or \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nformer citizen living in the United States in an attempt to gather valuable information \nfrom the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to her extended family living in France do not create a \npotential conflict of interest because this relationship is not sufficiently close to raise a \npossible security concern about her desire to help her family living in France by \nproviding classified information.    \n \nAs indicated previously, the Government\u2019s burden of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d is \nvery low. The Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nher family living in France, her relationship with them, and her travel to France in 2001, \n2005 and 2006 to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s relationship with her \nfamily members living in France because she does not have a sufficiently close \nemotional bond with them. She did not describe regular or frequent communications \nwith them. No living relatives, who are citizens and residents of France, are listed in the \nSOR.     \n \nThere is no evidence that her family members living in France have been political \nactivists, challenging the policies of the French Government. There is no evidence that \nterrorists or the French Government have approached or threatened Applicant or her \nfamily in France because of her work in the United States. There is no evidence that her \nfamily living in France currently engages in activities which would bring significant \nattention to them or that they or other French elements are even aware that Applicant \nworks for a government contractor or might have access in the future to classified \ninformation. As such, there is a reduced possibility that these relatives would be targets \nfor coercion or exploitation. 9 \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with her parents and brother and her strong \nconnections to the United States tend to mitigate foreign interest security concerns. \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [she] \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Her \nparents and brother are U.S. citizens, and reside in the United States. Applicant has \nlived in the United States for most of her life. She is fully inculcated with U.S. values. All \nof her investments are in the United States, and she has no property or investments in \nFrance. She has many friends and colleagues in the United States. She is a loyal, \ndedicated and trustworthy U.S. citizen.  \n \n \n9 Contacts with relatives living in a foreign country are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the \n[foreign] government has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)), an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to [the foreign \ncountry]\u201d and \u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR \nCase No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I \nconclude that many of these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person \nconcept. Moreover, there is persuasive case law urging broad consideration of numerous factors in the \nwhole person concept, which overrides these restrictive decisions. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning France must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in France, as well as the dangers existing in France.10 France\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States has changed over the decades and is likely to \nchange again in the future. France is and has been an important U.S. ally; however, on \nsome occasions, such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq, has contested U.S. policy. France \ncurrently has an excellent human rights record. France has weapons of mass \ndestruction, is an important trading partner and vigorously suppresses terrorism.  \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the United States for most of her adult life. \nShe was born in the United States. Her parents are U.S. citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. Her assets are in the United States and she has no assets in France. \nApplicant is a law-abiding U.S. citizen, and there is no evidence of any performance or \nwork-related problems. I found her statements to be honest, candid and credible.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct contacts with her family in France and her indirect contacts with \nher family in France through her parents, who are dual citizens of France and the United \n                                            \n10 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nStates, as well as her visits to France raise some foreign influence security concerns. \nTheoretically, she might be vulnerable to French coercion and non-coercive measures \nbecause of her French citizenship, background and family in France. However, there is \nno evidence that France engages in such conduct. There is no reason to believe the \nFrench government and/or French intelligence personnel would violate French, United \nStates or international law, by using improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified \ninformation from Applicant. The key rationale for denying Applicant\u2019s clearance is her \nretention of a currently valid French passport, and her use of that passport to visit \nFrance. Of course, if she had \u201cexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d \nthis would have mitigated some foreign preference concerns under AG \u00b6 11(b), supra.  \n \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of her connections to France and to the \nUnited States, I conclude Applicant has mitigated foreign influence security concerns; \nhowever, she failed to carry her burden of mitigating the foreign preference security \nconcerns.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude she is not eligible for access to classified information.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n",

On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline B and Guideline C. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 10, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 20, 2008, and waived his right \nto a hearing before an administrative judge; however, Department Counsel exercised its \nright to have a hearing and on November 28, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to another \nadministrative judge. On December 5, 2008, the case was re-assigned to me. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on December 16, 2008, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 15, 2009. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were received into the record without objection. Applicant testified. The record \nremained open until January 30, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit \ndocuments. On January 28, 2009, he submitted three exhibits that I marked as (AE) A \nthrough C, and admitted into the record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Russia. (Tr. 13-14) The request and the attached documents \nare included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1 through 9. Applicant did not object \nto my consideration of those exhibits, as relating to Russia. Hence, the facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out under the \nheading, The Russian Federation.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 20, 2008, Applicant admitted all factual \nallegations contained under Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.   \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. He was born and raised in a large city in Russia. He \nattended high school and college there. In February 1978, he married his wife, a \nRussian citizen resident. The following February, he earned a Master of Science in \nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science. He and his wife have two sons, ages 25 \nand 29, both born in Russia. His wife holds an advanced degree in computer science \nthat she earned from a Russian university.  \n \n \nIn 1991, Applicant and his wife applied for visas to come to the United States. \n(Tr. 21) In July 1996, they, along with their two children, immigrated to the United States \nas Jewish refugees. (Tr. 40-41) In March 2005, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. \nHis two children became naturalized U. S. citizens in 2003. His wife, a resident alien, \napplied for citizenship, but has not yet received it. (Tr. 27) All of his immediate family \nmembers live in the United States and are \u201cAmericanized.\u201d (Tr. 41) One of his sons is \npursuing a degree in computer science at a prestigious U.S. university, and the other \nrecently completed a Master\u2019s degree in aviation at another well-know university.  He \nimmigrated because the \u201cUnited States was a country of my dreams, and it was a \nsymbol of freedom. I wanted to live in a country like that all my life.\u201d (Tr. 21)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Russia and resided there until their death in 1993. (Tr. \n33) He has an older sister who was born in Russia and resides there along with her son. \nPrior to her retirement, she worked as a mechanical engineer in private industry. Her \nson is a construction contractor. Applicant loves his sister and talks or emails her and \nhis nephew once every couple months. (Tr. 35; GE 2) Both of them would like to come \nto the United States, but find it difficult to obtain a Visa. (Tr. 36) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-\nlaw and father-in-law are deceased. (GE 1 at 23-24) He has a couple friends that he \nemails occasionally. (GE 2) \n \n \n \n \nAfter arriving in the United States, Applicant learned English and worked in low \nlevel positions for five years until he was able to improve his skills and obtain a better \nposition. (Tr. 22)  In May 2003, he obtained his current position in which he designs and \nimplements computer networks for a federal contractor.   \n \n \nApplicant returned to Russia in March 2000, April-May 2004, and October 2006 \nfor two week vacations to visit his sister. On each visit he used his Russian passport. In \nMarch 2005, Applicant renewed that passport, which was issued in March 2006 and is \nvalid until March 2011. He renewed it because it was easier for him to visit Russia with \nit, rather than his U.S. passport. He did not know that using it after becoming employed \nby a federal contractor could pose a problem, as he never received any briefings from \nhis employer on the issue. (Tr. 52) He brought it with him to the hearing, ready to \nsurrender it, and did not know he could tender it to his employer. (Tr. 49) On January \n23, 2009, he surrendered the passport to his facility security officer and is willing to have \nit destroyed. (Tr. 49; AE B) \n \n \n \nApplicant rents his home and has about $300,000 in retirement fund. (Tr. 43) He \nalso has U. S. bank accounts. (Tr. 21). He does not own any property in Russia. (Tr. 44) \nHe does not have any retirement benefits there. (Tr. 50) He has not voted in any \nRussian elections since moving to the United States. (Id.) He has developed ties to his \nlocal community. (Tr. 44) He voted in the recent U.S. presidential election. He has no \nplans of ever permanently returning to Russia, nor do his children. (Tr. 46; 59) There is \nno derogatory information concerning his police or financial records. He has never been \nfired from a job. He has no police record other than a speeding ticket. He has never \nused illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related incident. (GE 1).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a letter of recommendation. He has held a Top \nSecret clearance for 30 to 40 years. He met Applicant in the spring of 2003 when \nApplicant began working for their employer. The supervisor is highly complementary of \nApplicant\u2019s work and integrity. Because of his high level of performance, the company \nrequested Applicant seek a security clearance in order to assist the company in its \nsupport of several internal classified engineering networks. Throughout his employment, \nApplicant \u201chas had total access to the entire [company\u2019s] network and takes his \nresponsibility for his continued security, expansion and enhancement very seriously.\u201d \n(AE C) The supervisor has no hesitation in recommending Applicant for his clearance,  \nstating that he is loyal employee, trustworthy, conscientious, and responsible. He noted \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nthat Applicant has obtained numerous industry certifications, \u201cBut none of these \ncertifications mean more to [Applicant] than achieving his U.S. citizenship.\u201d (Id.)   \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. \ncitizenship and desire to retain his work with his current employer. In response to a \nquestion about what he most likes about the United States, he stated, \u201cI like the \nfreedom and the American way of life. There is no corruption over here. . . You\u2019ll be a \nloyal person and that\u2019s all you need to do. You don\u2019t need to cheat. You just work hard \nand everything comes well.\u201d (Tr. 48) He considers himself to be an American and not a \nRussian. He is willing to renounce his Russian citizenship. (Tr. 51) He does not miss \nRussia, stating, \u201cI am kind of ashamed of participation of Russia, and I am glad that I \nam not tied to Russia any more. And that is actually the reason I wanted to move from \nRussia to the United States because I don\u2019t want to be part of this mess [Sic].\u201d  (Tr. 56) \n \nThe Russian Federation \n \n \n The Russian Federation is a diverse and vast country. It is 1.8 times the size of \nthe United States with a population of 142 million people. It achieved independence with \nthe dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. (HE 1) The country is a very \nlarge nuclear superpower that has continued to develop economically, socially and \npolitically since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Recent events that have escalated \ntensions between Russia and the United States include the incursion into internationally \nrecognized sovereign Georgia territory by the Russian army, threats against Poland, \nsuspicious poisonings and killings of journalists and other persons considered to be \nundesirable, and manipulation of energy resources to pressure NATO allies and other \nU.S. friendly countries. Russia has an active, recent, and ongoing intelligence collection \nprogram targeting the United States. As of 2005, Russia and China were the most \naggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounted for the \nmajority of such targeting. Russia has been a leader in industrial espionage against the \nUnited States since at least 1997, with no indication of abatement. Russia shares \nvarious technologies of security concern with other countries whose interests are \ncontrary to those of the United States. Russian officials reportedly engage in human \nrights abuses, including abductions, torture, coerced confessions, and unlawful \nsurveillance of citizens and visitors. (HE 2, 5, 7, and 9) \n \nThe U.S. State Department succinctly describes the relationship between the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation as follows: \n \nThe United States and Russia share common interests on a broad range of \nissues, including counterterrorism and the drastic reduction of our strategic arsenals. \nRussia shares our basic goal of stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them.  The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) \nprogram, launched in 1992 to facilitate dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction \nin the former Soviet Union, was renewed in 2006 until 2013. At the 2006 G8 Summit in \nSt. Petersburg, the U.S. and Russia announced the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \nTerrorism to keep terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials. We are working with \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nRussia to bring Iran\u2019s nuclear programs into compliance with International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) rules and United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737, \n1747, and 1803. On North Korea, Russia is a participant in the Six-Party Talks aimed at \nthe verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Russia also takes part in the \nMiddle East Peace Process \u201cQuartet\u201d (along with the UN and the EU). Russia now \ninteracts with NATO members as an equal through the NATO-Russian Council but \nwithout veto power over NATO decisions. During the past several years, Russia has \nintensified its efforts to combat trafficking in persons. We are cooperating in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS. (HE 1) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, two of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and,  \n \n (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nIn this case, Applicant remains in communication with his older sister and \nnephew, who are resident citizens of Russia, a country of significant concern for \ninformation security and espionage against the United States. He has made three visits \nto Russia since 2000 to see his sister and nephew and has his frequent contact with \nthem, which demonstrate the importance of this family relationship Those connections \nare more likely to generate a heightened risk of exploitation, pressure or coercion than \nmost other countries. In addition, his wife, who resides with him, remains a citizen of \nRussia. These facts meet the Government\u2019s burden of production by raising both of the \naforementioned disqualifying conditions. These contacts and relationships shift the \nburden to Applicant to prove mitigation. \n \n  \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nGiven the nature of the Russian government and Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ongoing \npresence there, a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, or coercion \nremains a concern. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his sister \nand nephew are more than casual, such that AG \u00b6 8(c) is not applicable. \n \nApplicant established application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States since arriving in 1996 as a \nrefugee.  His children are naturalized U.S. citizens, residing in the United States. His \nwife is a resident alien, awaiting citizenship. None of his family has any intention of \npermanently returning to Russia. He has a very good job and is involved in local \ncommunity activities. He considers himself an American and not a Russian. He has \nbank accounts and retirement funds in the United States. In contrast, his Russian \ninterests have become minimal over the years. He does not own property there and has \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nonly two family members living there. He is willing to renounce his Russian citizenship in \nfavor of the United States. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9:  \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, and then he or she may be prone \nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying, one of which may be applicable in this case:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country; \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and, \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and, \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nApplicant\u2019s admission that he exercised dual citizenship when he chose to use \nhis Russian passport to travel to Russia after becoming a U.S. citizen is sufficient to \nraise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).   \nAG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline, two of which may be applicable: \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nWhile testifying, Applicant expressed his willingness to renounce his Russian \ncitizenship, which is sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 11(b). Upon learning \nhow to officially surrender his Russian passport to his employer, he immediately did so, \nwarranting the application of AG \u00b6 11(e).  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nIn cases involving foreign influence, the Appeal Board requires the whole person \nanalysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of \nan applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his \nor her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given \ncase.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). In that same decision, the \nAppeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which provides: \n \nApplicant has been in the U.S. for twenty years and a naturalized citizen \nfor seven. Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are \nU.S. citizens by birth. Her ties to these family members are stronger than \nher ties to family members in Taiwan. She has significant financial interest \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nin the U.S. and none in Taiwan. She testified credibly that she takes her \nloyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would defend the interest of the U.S. \nHer supervisors and co-workers assess her as very loyal and trustworthy.   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, Russia\u2019s government is a rival of the \nUnited States and in some instances has not conformed to widely accepted norms of \nhuman rights. More importantly for security purposes, Russia is actively involved in \nespionage against the United States, and may attempt to use \u00e9migr\u00e9s such as \nApplicant for espionage. Second, Applicant had numerous connections to Russia before \ncoming to the United States in 1996. Following his birth, he spent his formative years \nthere. He was educated at a Russian university, as was his wife. Third, his sister and \nnephew remain resident citizens of Russia. Fourth, he has some contact with his sister \nwhom he loves and would like to come to the United States.  \n \nThere are many other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a \nU.S. citizen that weigh in favor of granting Applicant a security clearance. He is a \nmature person, who has lived in the United States for 12 years, and became a U.S. \nnaturalized citizen in March 2005 when he swore allegiance to the United States.  His \nspouse has been living in the United States since 1996 and is permanent alien resident, \nawaiting citizenship. His two children are U.S. naturalized citizen, whom he described \nas \u201cAmericanized.\u201d There is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, \nand has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several years. His supervisor \nassesses him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and responsible, giving him an \nexcellent recommendation and commenting on Applicant\u2019s pride in being a U.S. citizen. \nHe asserted his pride of American citizenship and his deep disappointment or distain for \nRussia and it policies. There is no reason to believe that he would take any action that \ncould cause potential harm to his U.S. family or this country. Because his immediate \nfamily members live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or \nexploitation by a foreign power. The realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, \nexploitation or duress is low. Based on all of those factors and his credible and sincere \ntestimony, I do not believe he would compromise national security, or otherwise comply \nwith any Russian threats or coercion. No witnesses recommended denial of his security \nclearance. There is not any derogatory information about him in the record other than a \nspeeding ticket.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence.2 Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \n                                            \n2 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

MacKinnon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: William Savarino, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case\nOn September 17, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\ndetermination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied or revoked. \nSeptember 21, 2011\n\n2\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 22, 2010, and requested a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel filed an amendment to the SOR on  February 7, 2011.  Applicant\nresponded to the amended SOR on March 9, 2011. \nThe case was assigned to another judge and reassigned to me on April 5, 2011.\nThe case was scheduled for hearing on April 15, 2011. A hearing was held as\nscheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant, continue, or deny Applicant\u2019s application for a security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of eight exhibits (GEs 1-8);\nApplicant relied on seven witnesses (including himself) and seven exhibits (AEs A-G).\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received April 25, 2011.  \nBesides his seven exhibits, Applicant requested administrative notice of six\ndocuments: White House Press Release, Remarks by President Obama and Prime\nMinister Gillard of Australia (March 7, 2011); U.S.-Australia Relations, Prime Minister\nGillard\u2019s Address to U.S. Congress (March 11, 2011); American forces Press Release,\nU.S.-Australian Alliance Never More Important (November 7, 2010); U.S. Central\nCommand, Support to the Global War on Terror (April 14, 2011); Background Note:\nAustralia, U.S. Department of State (November 24, 2010); and Security Treaty Between\nAustralia, New Zealand, and the United States (Australian Treaty Series 1952 No. 2,\n1997).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).  Administrative notice is appropriate\nfor noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice\nwas granted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the\ngeopolitical situation in Australia.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents\nthemselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did\nnot foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information\ncontained in the reports addressing Australia\u2019s current status.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline C, Applicant allegedly: (a) exercised dual citizenship with\nAustralia and the United States by applying for citizenship with Australia, applying for\nand retaining an Australian passport in January 2006, even though he possessed a U.S.\npassport issued in June 2002 that will not expire until January 2016, and used his\nAustralian passport instead of his U.S. passport for travel to Australia from about 1998\nto at least 2009 and (b) obtained an Australian secret or top secret security clearance,\nwhich he has held from 1993 to at least February 2010, having secured its update in\nabout 2008. \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly: (a) sought and held employment with an\nAustralian defense organization from about 1993 to 1998 and (b) maintains substantial\n\n3\nfinancial and property interests in Australia, to include a bank account with a value of\napproximately $700,000. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations.  He provided\nno explanations.\nDepartment counsel amended the SOR in February 2011 to add Guideline L\nallegations. Under Guideline L, the allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.b and 2.a\nwere incorporated by reference. In his answer, Applicant admitted the amended\nallegations without explanation.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 74-year-old engineering consultant for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married W1 in April 1958 and divorced her in October 1961. (GEs 1\nand 4; Tr. 77) He has three adult children from this marriage. (GE 1) He married W2 in\nJune 1982. She developed depression later in their marriage and turned to alcoholism.\n(Tr. 84-86) W2 abandoned him in the early 90s, claiming she could never cure herself\nwhile living with him. (Tr. 85-86). He divorced W2 in June 1992. (GE 1) \nApplicant married W3, a U.S. citizen, in September 1992. (GE 1; Tr. 87-88) W3\npassed away in July 2006 after a long battle with cancer. (GEs 1 and 4) Two years later,\nhe married W4, a U.S. citizen and resident. (GE 4; Tr. 147)  They continue to  maintain\ntheir primary residence in the U.S. (GE 4)\nBetween 1955 and 1958, Applicant served in the U.S. military as a Army enlistee.\n(GE 1; Tr.76) He received an honorable discharge in May 1958. Following his Army\ndischarge, he enrolled in college on a night basis and pursued an engineering\ncurriculum. (Tr. 77-78)\nApplicant earned a BS degree in electrical engineering from an accredited U.S.\nuniversity in June 1965. (GEs 1 and 4)   He earned an MSE in engineering from another\ninstitution in June 1967 and a PhD in electrical engineering from the same institution in\nSeptember 1971, while working for a defense contractor. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 79-80)  \nBetween 1973 and 1993, Applicant worked for a major defense contractor.\nBefore his retirement in 1993, he served as his company\u2019s chief scientist and was\nresponsible for research and development of weapons systems for DoD. (GE 4; Tr.82-\n83). He became a self-described authority on stealth air vehicle design and\ndevelopment, weapon systems analysis and design, radar and infrared surveillance,\nand all-spectrum signatures and images of air, land, and sea targets. (GE 4) He held a\n\n4\nsecurity clearance for all of his employment years with this defense contractor. With his\nanticipated retirement from his defense employer, Applicant also resigned his\nmembership on DoD\u2019s scientific advisory board. (AE K)\nFollowing his retirement from his U.S. defense contractor employer in 1993,\nApplicant and W3 (who worked for the same defense contractor and held a security\nclearance at the time of their marriage) made a joint decision to relocate to Australia\nand start a new life. (GE 4 and AEs F and G; Tr.  87-90) Without an identified job in the\ncountry, Australia\u2019s immigration laws did not permit residence in the country beyond the\nthree months available on a tourist visa. (GE 4; Tr. 89-90). And because of a cannot-\ncompete clause in his employment contract with his U.S. employer, he could not employ\nwith any private competitor of his U.S. employer. (Tr. 185-186).\nWith the help of W3, Applicant was able to locate a potential job with an\nAustralian defense organization. (Tr. 93-94, 181-183) Before accepting the Australian\ndefense offer, he obtained oral assurances from the U.S. State Department (DoS) that\nhis U.S. citizenship would not be jeopardized by his taking permanent Australian\ncitizenship should he ever return to the United States and reenter the U.S. defense\nindustry (Tr. 95-97) \nApplicant also elicited assurances from his U.S. defense employer and AF\nsecurity officers that he should not encounter any problems reactivating his U.S.\nsecurity clearance, absent any encountered problems in Australia. (Tr. 96-97; 188-192)\nHowever, his assurances were not reduced to writing.\nIn March 1993, Applicant accepted employment with an Australian defense\norganization under a temporary employment contract (guaranteed for one year and\nrenewable for up to five  years as a principal research scientist (GEs 2 and 4 and AEs\nF, G, and Q; Tr. 185) with this defense organization. He advised his prospective\nemployer of his intent to relocate to Australia. (GE 1 and AE Q) At the time, he had no\nintention of relocating to Australia permanently. (Tr. 95-96) In exit letters to colleagues\nwith his defense contractor, he disclosed his plans to take a temporary civilian position\nwith the Australian Defense Department. He assured his colleagues of his intention to\nresume his career in the United States (conditions permitting) \n Initially, Applicant and W3 acquired temporary Australian residency status. (Tr.\n105) His Australian employer advised him that after May 1995 he could not reenter\nAustralia without Australian citizenship and persuaded him to switch to permanent\nresidency status. (Tr.106-108) \nApplicant\u2019s employment conditions with his new Australian government employer\nrequired him to sign an agreement that he would seek citizenship when he became\neligible. (GE 4) With help from his Australian employer, he was able to expedite his\ncitizenship application and acquired his Australian citizenship in a little over two years\n(i.e, in 1996). (GE 2; Tr. 120) His employer also required him to obtain an Australian\n\n5\nsecurity clearance as a condition of employment. (GEs 2 and 4 and AEs F and G; Tr.\n109) \nUpon applying for Australian citizenship in 1993, the Australian DoD granted him\na security clearance the same year. (Tr. 109) Applicant held an Australian security\nclearance for the duration of his employment with his Australian defense organization.\n(GE2)\nApplicant\u2019s civilian work for his Australian defense organization involved mostly\nclassified projects (about 80%), but included some work on analysis of Australian\ncooperative ventures with the United Sytates on overhead surveillance. (Tr. 191-192)\nHis work included scientific analysis of airborne radar systems. (AE O; Tr. 192)\nApplicant continued his direct employment with his Australian defense organization\nthrough August 1998, and held both Australian citizenship and an Australian security\nclearance for the duration of his employment.  (Tr.120,151-152)  \nWhile still employed by his Australian defense organization, Applicant also\nundertook consulting assignments with both U.S. defense contractors and the U.S. DoJ\nwith the acquiescence of the Australian government (GE 4 AE O; Tr.112-113-194-195)\nHis consulting work for DoJ required a security clearance, and DoJ granted him a\nsecurity clearance in 1996 without any documented ancillary DoD rights. (AE J\nApplicant  made it clear to his Australian defense employer that \u201cclassified knowledge\ngained through his previous employment on Defense projects in the U.S. would not be\ndivulged.\u201d (AE O) Applicant\u2019s Australian defense employer accepted Applicant\u2019s self-\nimposed information-sharing limitations with the understanding he would avoid any\nconflicts of interest, and approved his DoJ assignment.  (AE O; Tr. 114-115)  \nFor the ensuing six years (between 1995 and 2001), Applicant commuted to the\nUnited States to fulfill his witness and consulting commitments to the U.S. DoJ.  (GEs 2\nand 4) His U.S. DoJ employer at the time sponsored Applicant in his security clearance\napplication. (GE 4)   Applicant assures he was granted a security clearance for his DoJ\nconsulting work in 1997 while he was still contemporaneously employed by the\nAustralian defense organization, and with the acquiescence of his DoJ employers. (AEs\nB, H, M, and R; Tr.  116-118, 126-127) \nApplicant assures he fully informed his DoJ employer of his Australian citizenship\nand security clearance and past employment with the Australian defense organization.\n(AE R; Tr. 116-118,126-127) However, the declaration furnished by the DoJ attorney\nresponsible for hiring Applicant as a DoJ expert does not indicate any awareness of\nApplicant\u2019s holding an Australian security clearance. And the SF-86 Applicant\ncompleted for DoJ does not list any Australian security clearance. (AE I).  So, it is still\nunclear from the proofs whether DoJ was officially informed of Applicant\u2019s Australian\nsecurity clearance when it approved his security clearance for access to DoJ-related\nclassified information. \n\n6\nBesides his DoJ consulting contract, Applicant was sponsored by a DoD\ncontractor in1996 to obtain a security clearance that would permit him access to\nclassified information. As a part of his application, Applicant was asked to provide a\nseparate SF-86.  He completed this SF-86 in November 1996 and was granted a DoD\nsecurity clearance in 2000. (AEs J and M)  In his clearance application, he listed his\nAustralian citizenship and passport, but not his Australian security clearance. (AE J; Tr.\n127-130) Whether DoD was aware of Applicant\u2019s Australian security clearance when it\ngranted him a DoD clearance in 2000 is unclear.        \n                                                                              \nPost-retirement activity\nUpon his retirement from his direct employment position with the Australian\ndefense organization in 1998, Applicant became eligible for an Australian pension. (GE\n2) Since 1998, he has continued to receive an annual pension from the Australian\ngovernment totaling around $10,000. (GE 2) Between 1998 and 2001, he continued to\nconsult with the defense organization, as well as DoJ and U.S. defense contractors, on\nboth classified and unclassified projects. During this time frame, he retained his security\nclearance with the Australian government while supporting the government\u2019s defense\nscience board.  (GEs 2 and 4 and AE B; Tr.132-134, 226) He and W3 also looked for\nnew housing in a northeast section of Australia. (GE 4) They purchased a home in this\nregion and established their permanent residence in this home. (GE 4)\nBy late 1998, W3 had contracted a rare cancer. (GE 4; Tr. 225) To ensure the\nbest medical treatment for her, they returned to the U.S. in 2001. (GEs 2 and 4) By\n2001, W3's health had deteriorated to the point where she required regular cancer\ntreatments. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 137-138, 225) Between 2001 and 2005, Applicant and W3\npurchased a home in their local U.S. community and remained in the United States for\nthe most part. (GE 4; Tr. 138) During this inclusive period, Applicant suspended virtually\nall of his U.S. and Australian consulting assignments. (Tr. 139) For added convenience\nwhen he did return to Australia for business purposes, he obtained an Australian\npassport in 1998 and used it on his return trips. (GE 2) He updated his Australian\npassport in January 2006, even though he had previously updated his U.S. passport in\nJune 2002. (GE 2)\nW3 passed away in early 2006. (GEs 1 and  4; Tr. 140). In September 2006,\nApplicant applied for the updating of his DoD security clearance (GE 2; Tr. 143-144)\nThe following month (in October 2006), he applied to the Australian government for the\nupdating of his Australian security clearance; his clearance was updated. When asked\nby an  investigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who interviewed him\nin January 2007 why he updated his Australian security clearance, Applicant responded\nthat he \u201cwanted to keep all his options open.\u201d (GE 2) To date, he has retained his\nAustralian clearance. \nApplicant last provided consulting services to the Australian government in 2007.\n(Tr. 209) He maintains contact with a number of friends and former colleagues in\nAustralia, but has no family members living in the country. (Tr. 171-172) Currently, he\n\n7\nearns consulting fees in the United States that have varied from $40,000 a year to\n$100,000 a year. (Tr. 171)\nApplicant\u2019s property interests \nWhen Applicant relocated to Australia in 1993, he transferred all of his combined\nchecking, savings and term deposits in U.S. banks (about $700,000) to an Australian\nsavings account (AEs 2 and 4).  He and W3 purchased a home in Australia following\ntheir relocation and held the home for approximately five years before they sold it in\n1998. (GE 2; Tr. 105) Following Applicant\u2019s retirement from his Australian government\nemployment the same year, he and W3 purchased another home in a northern\nAustralian province, with the intention of using the home for their permanent Australian\nretirement. (AE 2). They paid over $600,000 in cash for their home and never placed a\nmortgage on the property. (GE 2; Tr. 161)  \nWith funds withdrawn from his Australian bank account, Applicant and W3\npurchased their U.S. home in the 1993 time frame.  They financed the purchase of this\nhome with a first mortgage (amount unknown).  Following W3's death in 2006, Applicant\ncontinued to maintain this home with his own resources.  After his marriage to W4 in\nMay 2008, he and his spouse continued to maintain both of their homes in their U.S.\ncommunity. \nBy 2007, Applicant was no longer reliant on income from Australia to cover his\nexpenses (save for expenses incurred in the maintenance of his Australian home and\nvisits to the country). He maintained U.S. assets of $363,000 (with $263,000 allocated\nto his home) at the time and a U.S. IRA account valued at about $700,000. (GE 2) W4\nreported assets of about $125,000 and an IRA account worth about $250,000. Still, he\nmaintained his Australian home, valued at $1.1 million, and retained  deposits of around\n$620,000 in an Australian bank. (GE 3)  He also receives a small pension from Australia\nas the result of his direct employment with a defense organization of the Australian\ngovernment.\nCommitted in 2007 to relocating permanently to the United States transferring\nmany of his Australian liquid assets to U.S. accounts, and updating his U.S. security\nclearance, Applicant placed his Australian home up for sale the same year. (GE 2; Tr.\n145) He sold this house in March 2009. (Tr. 146) With urging from W4, he then made a\ncash purchase of a smaller vacation home in the same region of Australia for about\n$650,000 and made substantial improvements in the home (GE 4; Tr. 147-148, 159-\n160) Applicant and W4 took possession of the home in April 2009. (Tr. 148)\nHaving second thoughts on the wisdom of purchasing this second home,\nApplicant and W4 placed the property up for sale in May 2010 with a local real estate\nagent. (AE N; Tr. 150-154)  When they did not receive any offers for the home at their\n$750,000 asking price, Applicant lowered the asking price to $700,000. (AE N; Tr. 160-\n162) \n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s listing agreement expired in March 2011. (AE N) His current progress\nin selling his Australian residence is unknown. (Tr. 162) He has no updated information\non market conditions or his sale prospects in the foreseeable future, but knows he\nneeds his Australian citizenship to retain and sell the property at fair market value. (AE\nC; Tr. 162-163) In the interim, he still maintains a large Australian bank account (around\n$800,000). He has net annual income from Australia of approximately $53,000, which\nconsists of his lectureship, interest on his savings, his 401(k), and his Australian\ngovernment pension, which nets him about $1,200 a month. (GE 4; Tr. 170-171; 214-\n215) He continues to pay Australian income and property taxes, and has voted in\nAustralian elections. (Tr. 215-216) By comparison, Applicant has a home in the U.S.\nvalued at about $200,000 and a U.S. bank account of $160,000. (Tr. 168)\nApplicant\u2019s passport, citizenship, and security clearance status\nSince updating his Australian passport in January 2006, Applicant used it on\nseveral occasions to enter and exit Australia. (Tr. 212) He never used his Australian\npassport after 2009 and documents surrendering it to the Australian government in April\n2011. (AE L)  Currently, Applicant retains his U.S. passport and uses it now exclusively\nwhen he travels anywhere in the world.  It is his understanding that Australian citizens\nmust use their Australian passports when entering and exiting the country; U.S. citizens\nmust use their U.S. passports. (Tr. 219) Applicant is not sure how Australia administers\nits passport laws with dual citizens like himself.   \nWhen Applicant applied for Australian citizenship in 1993, he pledged his loyalty\nto Australia and its people, \u201cwhose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties\nI respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey.\u201d (GE 4)  This pledge has evolved\nsince its introduction in January 1949. (GE 5) The original citizenship oath required the\napplicant to swear allegiance to be faithful and bear true allegiance to his Majesty King\nGeorge the VI, his heirs, and successors, faithfully observe the laws of Australia, and\nfulfill his duties as an Australian citizen. (GE 5) This oath underwent a number of\namendments between 1948 and 1993. The 1993 amendment introduced a pledge of\ncommitment to replace the oath or affirmation of allegiance and remove the reference to\nthe Crown. (GE 5) Still, the pledge of commitment imposes a pledge of loyalty on an\napplicant to Australia and its people. The pledge is written in the conjunctive and binds\nan applicant to the country and its government and may not be parsed to minimize its\nimpact on an applicant for Australian citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s claim of a more limited reading of the commitment pledge he took in\n1995 to extend loyalty to Australia and its  people cannot be sustained as a fair and\nreasonable interpretation of the pledge. By pledging his loyalty to Australia and its\npeople, Applicant declared his support to Australia\u2019s government and institutions as well\nas its people, and in doing so placed himself in a position of potential conflict with the\ngovernmental interests of the United States were the two countries ever to become at\nodds over protecting their vital security interests.  (GE 5)  \nWhen Applicant surrendered his Australian passport in 2011, he did not\nrenounce his Australian citizenship. (AE L; Tr. 222) He is reluctant to renounce his\n\n9\nAustralian citizenship for so long as he owns real estate in Australia. (Tr. 162-163, 165-\n166, 222) He understands that ownership of real property in Australia requires the\nowner to be either a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. He cites advice he\nreceived from his Australian attorney in October 2010 that should he surrender his\nAustralian citizenship and passport, the country\u2019s foreign investment and review board\ncould require him to sell his home and suffer losses, given the current depressed nature\nof the real estate market in his region of Australia. (AE C; Tr. 163, 237-239) Applicant\u2019s\nunderstanding of Australia\u2019s limitations on home ownership in the country is not in\ndispute.  His decision to retain his Australian citizenship until he is able to divest himself\nof his Australian home is not an unreasonable one from an economic point of view. But\nit does reflect an option exercise and illustrates a split preference for the government\nand institutions of Australia and those of the United States.  \nBesides his continued holding of dual citizenship with Australia and the United\nstates, Applicant retains security clearances with both Australia and the United states,\nas well.  While he has had no occasion to use his Australian clearance in recent years,\nhe has not relinquished it. (Tr. 227) He assures that he has never encountered a\nsituation where his project access to classified information in either country created a\nconflict of interest with his clearance access in the other. \nApplicant, however, has never obtained any written approvals that he can\ndocument. Considering all of the surrounding historical circumstances of Applicant\u2019s\nwork in the two countries to date, inferences warrant that his holding security clearances\nwith Australia and the United States  contemporaneously provides the potential for a\nconflict of interest should the security interests of Australia and the U.S. ever diverge.  \nAustralia\u2019s country status\nThe Commonwealth of Australia (comprised of six colonies) is a constitutional\nmonarchy with a constitution patterned partly on the model of the U.S. Constitution;\nalthough it does not include a bill of rights. (see Background Note: Australia, supra)\nAustralia is an independent nation within the British Commonwealth.  It has a bicameral\nfederal parliament, whose chambers have equal power, except that revenue bills must\noriginate in the House of Representatives. (see id.)  \nAustralia\u2019s court system is headed by the High Court of Australia, which has\ngeneral appellate jurisdiction over all other federal and state courts and possesses the\npower of constitutional review. (see Background Note: Australia, supra) Australia has a\npopulation of 22.3 million and a large diverse economy with a GDP of $1.2 trillion\n(estimated 2009-2010). (id.)\nIn foreign relations, Australia has historically been a strong and dependable ally\nof the United States and has fought beside the United States and other Allies in virtually\nevery significant conflict since WW I. (see Security Treaty between Australia, New\nZealand, and the United States, supra; Background Note: Australia, supra) Australian-\nU.S. defense relations are grounded in the Australia, New Zealand, U.S. (ANZUS)\n\n10\nsecurity treaty of 1951. (see id.)  The treaty binds the signatories to recognize that an\narmed attack in the Pacific area on any of them would endanger the peace and safety of\nthe others.  Since  New Zealand was suspended from treaty coverage following a port\ndispute in 1984, the ANZUS treaty remains in force between Australia and the United\nStates under the abbreviated heading of AUSMIN. The United States and Australia hold\nregular consultations and conduct a variety of joint activities (including military\nexercises). As a result of terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, then-\nPrime Minister Howard and U.S. President Bush jointly invoked the ANZUS treaty for\nthe first time. (id) Australia was one of the earliest participants in Operation Enduring\nFreedom.  \nIn May 2009, the Australian Government released its Defense white paper,\noutlining Australia\u2019s long term strategic outlook, which calls for enhancing its military\ndefenses. (see Background Note: Australia, supra).  In November 2010, high level U.S.\nofficials attended a summit with their Australian hosts to explore and chart future\nprogress for their longstanding alliance with a collective view of shaping a more stable,\nprosperous region in light of current and emerging threats and challenges. (see U.S.-\nAustralia Alliance never more Important, supra.)  \nMore recently, U.S. President Obama and Australian Prime Minister Gillard\nconducted bilateral meetings in Washington in which they, inter alia, celebrated the 60th\nanniversary of their alliance and stressed the strengths of their alliance: shared values\nbased on the deep and longstanding relationship between the two countries and their\nenduring friendship. (see Remarks by President Obama and Prime Minister Gillard,\nsupra.) \nU.S.-Australian relations are grounded in the WW II experiences of both\ncountries. Similarities in culture and historical background and shared democratic\nvalues have made U.S. relations with Australia exceptionally strong and close. (see GE\n7; Background Note: Australia, supra) Both countries share extensive links in their\ninternational relations that range from commercial, cultural, and environmental contacts\nto political and defense cooperation. \nHistorically, Australia and the United States have worked together closely to\npromote global trade liberalism over the past 50 years. (GE 7) Australia has\ndemonstrated vital interests in U.S. economic, trade, and investment policies and has\nworked closely with the United States in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other\npursuits in promoting their trade liberalization agendas. (GE 7)\nTwo-way trade exceeded $7.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2008-2009 and shows no\nsigns of ebbing in 2010. (see Background Note: Australia, supra)  Anchored by a\nbilateral Australia-U.S. Free Trade agreement completed in 2005, Australia and the\nUnited States have worked on a range of liberalizing trade reforms designed to\nstreamline and promote their trade liberalization agendas. (GE 7; Background Note:\nAustralia, supra)\n    \n\n11\nEndorsements\nApplicant has excellent character references to his credit. Former colleagues with\nhis longstanding defense employer in the United States who have worked with Applicant\nin the past, credit him with unique scientific and research skills. They consistently\ncharacterize Applicant as conscientious, dedicated, reliable, and trustworthy (see exs. D\nthrough S)  Consistently, they stress his conscientious work habits and recommend him\nfor a position of trust. \nApplicant earned numerous awards for his scientific contributions to the U.S.\ndefense effort before his retirement in 1993. Credits include a distinguished public\nservice award in 1983 from the U.S. DoD, aircraft design award in 1989, and a design\nand development award in 1992. (AEs A and P) Applicant has been a fellow of\nprestigious engineering and aeronautics societies, and has been honored for his\nengineering contributions by the Australian government. (AE P)\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in reaching at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial, commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk.  When evaluating an applicant\u2019s\nconduct, the relevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following AG \u00b6\n2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n12\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n     \n Foreign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nSee AG \u00b6  9.\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but\nnot limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.   See AG \u00b6 6.\nOutside Activities\nThe Concern: Involvement in certain types of activities of outside employment or\nactivities is of security concern if it imposes a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s\nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of\nclassified information.  AG \u00b6 36.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends,\nin large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\n\n13\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly regarded defense consultant who, after retiring from his\nsenior position with a U.S. defense contractor in 1993, relocated to Australia to work for\nan Australian defense organization. Conditions of his employment included Australian\ncitizenship and an Australian security clearance. Within a year his Australian employer\nissued him a security clearance, and within three years, he was granted citizenship by\nthe Australian government. Besides acquiring Australian citizenship and a top secret\nAustralian security clearance, he obtained an Australian passport in 1997, which he\nused when exiting and entering Australia on his trips to the United States. While he has\nsince surrendered his Australian passport, he retains both his Australian citizenship and\nhis Australian security clearance, and plans to retain both for the foreseeable future.  \nTrust concerns relate to foreign preference, conflicts of interest associated with\nhis holding dual security clearances with the U.S. DoD, and the Australian Defense\nDepartment, and foreign influence relative to his holding employment with an Australian\nDefense organization and maintaining substantial property interests in Australia.\nForeign Preference \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations of acts indicating a preference for the interests of the foreign\ncountry over the interests of the United States. The issues, as such, raise concerns over\nApplicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the United States.  By accepting\nemployment with an Australian defense organization, obtaining an Australian passport\nand security clearance, transferring his bank accounts and other liquid assets to\nAustralia, and acquiring Australian real estate reserved for residents and citizens of the\ncountry, Applicant revealed a split preference for the U.S. and Australia.  By accepting\nAustralian citizenship, he satisfied a major legal requirement for acquiring real property\nin the country. \nTaking advantage of one of Australia\u2019s ownership conditions, he and W3 were\nable to acquire and hold two pieces of property in Australia between 1993 and 1998.\n\n14\nAnd with his Australian passport and security clearance, he was able to freely exit and\nreenter the country with minimal disruption. Applicant continued his practice of using his\nAustralian citizenship, passport, and clearance  to vest and protect his consulting and\nreal estate interests in the country. \nNot until just before the hearing did he surrender his Australian passport to\nAustralian government personnel.  Pending the sale of his home, he remains unwilling\nto renounce his Australian citizenship. And he indicates uncertainty how to relinquish his\nAustralian security clearance. So, as matters stand, Applicant will continue to maintain\nhis dual citizenship with Australia and retain his Australian security clearance for the\nforeseeable future.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s surrender of his Australian passport may be sufficient to satisfy\nthe technical surrender requirements of MC \u00b6 11(e) of the AGs for foreign preference\n(see discussion infra), it does not in of itself resolve the larger preference question\nraised in this case.  Whether Applicant\u2019s possession and use of his Australian passport\nreflect an overall preference for his acquired country of Australia, or enjoyment of a\nprivilege of foreign citizenship for convenience purposes only that is not incompatible\nwith his imposed fiduciary duties to the United States, are issues that require reconciling\nwith the security requirements demanded of those who are afforded access to U.S.\nclassified information.\nSince becoming a naturalized Australian citizen, Applicant has taken several\nactions and exercised Australian privileges that reflect active indicia of dual citizenship.\nSpecifically, he accepted employment with the Australian government, acquired\nAustralian citizenship and an Australian security clearance to satisfy the demands of his\nAustralian employer, purchased real property and invested funds in Australian banks,\nobtained an Australian passport to meet country exit and entry requirements imposed\nby the Australian government, and retained his Australian citizenship and security\nclearance.\nIn assessing split-preference cases, the Appeal Board has looked to indicia of\nactive exercise of dual citizenship. In cases where there is record evidence of a dual-\ncitizen applicant having substantial real property interests in a country that are not\navailable to non-residents or citizens on the same terms, the Appeal Board has\nconsidered such interests to represent special benefits or privileges that reveal a\npreference to that particular country. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec.\n29, 2009); See ISCR Case No. 16098 at 2 (App. Bd.  May 29, 2003). \nDepartment Counsel finds parallels in Applicant\u2019s situation in ISCR Case No. 08-\n05869, at 4-7 (App. Bd. July 24, 2009) and the facts in the present case. Like Applicant\nhere, the applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-05869 relocated to Australia and became a\nnaturalized Australian citizen with an Australian passport and security clearance who\nmaintained dual citizenship with the U.S. However, his case differs from Applicant\u2019s in\nmany key respects. Unlike Applicant, the applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-05869 was\ncommissioned into the Australian Army, accepted graduate student benefits from the\n\n15\nArmy, paid Australian taxes, voted in Australian elections, and contributed to an\nAustralian retirement fund.  By joining the Australian Army, that applicant demonstrated\na willingness to risk life and limb for that country, which the Appeal Board found to\nreflect strong evidence of a \u201cprofound, deeply personal commitment to the interests and\nwelfare of that country.\u201d (id.)  Even after that applicant renounced his Australian\ncitizenship and relinquished his Australian passport, the Appeal Board found these\nactions insufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s demonstrated preference for Australia   (id. at\n5)  Considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s actions in  ISCR Case No. 08-05869,  the\nAppeal Board found a continuing preference for Australia despite his eventual return to\nthe United States, relinquishment of his Australian citizenship, and surrender of his\nAustralian passport.  See id, at 5-6.  \nApplicant\u2019s situation differs appreciably from those linked to the dual Australian-\nU.S. citizen applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-05869, supra. Service in a foreign military\nrequires much deeper and more exacting commitments to the country\u2019s defense efforts\nthan does working for the same foreign government in a civilian capacity. Applicant\u2019s\ncontinued maintenance of his Australian dual citizenship and security clearance to\nprotect his property interests and consulting prospects in the country is more\ncomparable to the fact situation in ISCR Case No. 08-02864, supra. Applicant\u2019s\nretaining his Australian citizenship and security clearance enables him to preserve his\nAustralian real estate holdings. \nWithout dual Australian citizenship retention, Applicant  could be subjected by the\nAustralian government to a forced sale of his property in a poor real estate market.  And\nby holding on to his Australian security clearance, he is able  to retain his employment\nand counseling options in Australia in case his U.S. consulting business does not\nprosper as he hopes.  Applicant\u2019s retaining his Australian citizenship and security\nclearance in these circumstances represents material indicia of a preference for\nAustralia that cannot be easily reconciled with the split preference he has shown for\nmany years for his home country of the United States.  \nPreference questions require predictive judgments about how an applicant can\nbe trusted in the future to honor his fiduciary responsibilities to the Government.\nApplicant worked in the defense industry as a respected scientist and advisor for over\n25 years and held security clearances for most of his professional career. Although he\nchecked with State and Defense Department officials about his prospects for regaining\nhis security clearance should he choose to return to the United States, he surely was\naware of the potential risks of working for the Australian government, acquiring dual\ncitizenship with the country, accepting a security clearance from his Australian\nemployer, and retaining his clearance while contemporaneously holding a U.S. security\nclearance. While his choices are understandable, considering his circumstances when\nhe retired from U.S. defense contractor in 1993, they also reflect a current and ongoing\nsplit preference for the United States and Australia.  \nBecause Applicant elected to retain his Australian citizenship, security clearance,\npassport, and other privileges of Australian citizenship (e.g., a pension and home\n\n16\nownership entitlements) while he still held dual U.S. citizenship and a U.S. security\nclearance without seeking the written approval of authorized DoD officials, the\nGovernment may apply certain provisions of disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) of AG\n\u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This DC includes but\nis not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such         \n           benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another    \n           country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d  \nSpecifically, DC \u00b6 10(a)(1)(3)(5) and (7) apply to the established facts and\ncircumstances herein. By acquiring and retaining his Australian citizenship and\npassport, Applicant was able to accept special real estate and mortgage borrowing\nbenefits in the Commonwealth of Australia that are not currently available to non-\nAustralian residents and citizens. As a dual citizen and resident of Australia, he has paid\nincome and property taxes to the Australian government and receives Australian\npension benefits.  And he has voted in Australian elections.  \nWere Applicant to renounce his Australian citizenship and relinquish his\nAustralian security clearance, he risks a potential forfeiture of his property and his ability\nto acquire Australian consulting assignments.  This creates a dilemma for Applicant who\nhas historically expressed his desire to keep his options open. His election to retain the\nAustralian citizenship he acquired in 1995 and preserve his consulting options in\nAustralia with his retention of his Australian citizenship makes good practical sense and\nreflects entirely rational and understandable choices on his  part.  They also reflect split\npreferences for his newly adopted country of Australia,  where he would like to retain a\npresence if possible. \nApplicant surrendered his Australian passport in April 2011, in accordance with\nestablished procedures for surrendering a foreign passport to a cognizant security\nauthority of the Australian government. In doing so, he does forfeit the short-term\nflexibility of unfettered and undocumented travel.  Applicant is quite right on this point.\nAnd, he may, accordingly, claim the benefits of another mitigating condition under\n\n17\nGuideline C. MC  \u00b6 11(e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d is fully applicable as well to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.  Because his dual citizenship status is not based on his parent\u2019s\ncitizenship, he may not claim the benefits of MC \u00b6 11(a), \u201cdual citizenship is based\nsolely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d Nor are any of the other\npotential mitigating conditions available to Applicant based on the developed record. \nWhole person precepts are certainly helpful to Applicant in surmounting the\nGovernment\u2019s preference concerns herein. The strong trust impressions he has forged\nwith his supervisors, coworkers, and friends who have worked with him add support to\nhis claims that during his more than 25 years of faithful service to the defense industry\nhe has demonstrated loyalty and preference for the United States.\nOverall, though, Applicant is not able to persuade that his current preference is\nwith the United States. Because he made considerable use of Australian privileges\nassociated with his obtaining his Australian citizenship and passport in 1995, he\nmanifested a preference for Australia under the criteria as established by the Appeal\nBoard. Applicant fails to absolve himself of foreign preference concerns associated with\nthe presented issue of whether he retains a preference or split preference for his\nadopted country (Australia), or his country of birth (the United States). Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a and\n1.b of Guideline C.\nOutside Activities that produce conflicts or potential conflicts of interest\nApplicant\u2019s contemporaneous, and potentially simultaneous possession of\nsecurity clearances with the US. DoD and Australia\u2019s defense department poses a\nconflict of interest with his U.S. DoD issuer on one side and a potentially similar conflict\nrisk with his Australian DoD employer. The Appeal Board addressed conflicts of interest\ngenerally in ISCR Case No. 00-0244 at 3-5 (Appeal Board January 29, 2001). While\nnoting the special relationship the host country employing the applicant had with the\nUnited States and the applicant\u2019s discounting of any potential conflict of interest,  the\nBoard found  applicant\u2019s conflict was not mitigated by the special allied relationship of\nthe two countries or by the absence of any realistic potential of the applicant\u2019s being\nsubjected to undue influence by the host government he worked for. \nIn ISCR Case No. 00-0244, supra, the Board noted applicant\u2019s lack of a proposal\nto terminate his conflict of interest, and found the applicant\u2019s duties with his first\ncompany to be incompatible with any security responsibilities he would have while\nemployed with his second company.  Considering all of the evidence of record, the\nBoard concluded that even if the likelihood of \u201cundue influence, coercion or pressure to\ndisclose classified information could be discounted, the possibility of inadvertent\ndisclosure cannot.\u201d  See id, at 6. The Board found the applicant failed to meet his\nburden of proof and sustained the hearing decision.  \n\n18\nWhile the underlying facts differ in ISCR Case No. 00-0244 from Applicant\u2019s\nsituation, the core principles that undergird conflict of interest concerns do not.  Where\nconflicts of interest exist, the potential for inadvertent disclosures, even if not\nintentioned, cannot be easily reconciled. Where actual or potential conflicts of interest\nare found, they must necessarily be carefully scrutinized.\nAbsent written approval by the authorized DoD approving authority, his holding of\nsecurity clearances with both countries simultaneously (as he seeks to achieve) would\nviolate U.S. security guidelines, as they are currently written, and leave U.S. clearance\nreviewers without any cognizable way of knowing and assessing what U.S. classified\ninformation is shared with its U.S. counterpart, Australia.  \nBased on the assembled facts, the Government may rely on two of the\ndisqualifying conditions covering outside activities: DC \u00b637(a)(1), \u201cany employment or\nservice, whether compensated or volunteer, with (1) \u201cthe government of a foreign\ncountry\u201d and (4), \u201cany foreign, domestic, or international organization or person\nengaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on intelligence, defense,\nforeign affairs, or protected technology.\u201d\nTo his credit, Applicant owns a proven track record for reliable and trustworthy\nservice in the U.S. defense industry before his retirement in 1993 and relocation to\nAustralia.  He has been honored with numerous awards and citations recognizing his\nconsiderable contributions to the U.S. defense effort and his dedication to protecting\nvital defense secrets.  \nHolding of a U.S. security clearance permits little deviation in the holder\u2019s fiducial\nresponsibilities and duties. Presumably, other governments like Australia impose similar\nburdens on their holders of security clearances.  For so long as the clearance holder is\nburdened with reciprocal fiducial obligations to each country he has clearances with, he\nplaces himself at risk to even inadvertent compromises of classified information in his\npossession and control.\nBefore or after he applied for his U.S. security clearance, Applicant had options\nat his disposal. As a first option, he could have sought written approval from the\nappropriate DoD authorizing official to maintain simultaneous security clearances with\nthe U.S. and Australia.  Alternatively, he could have formally relinquished his Australian\nsecurity clearance by posting a written request to relinquish his clearance to the\nappropriate Australian government official responsible for administering clearances.\nApplicant chose neither option and seeks a U.S. security clearance based on his\nlongstanding loyalty to the United States and his historically special contributions to U.S.\nsecurity interests.  \n Applicant\u2019s maintenance of simultaneous security clearances presents conflicts\nthat cannot be safely discounted. While the risks of his holding dual clearances pertain\nprincipally to risks of inadvertent disclosures while working on individual or joint projects,\nthey invite key concerns that cannot be reconciled without DoD written approvals.\n\n19\nAvailable mitigating conditions within DOHA\u2019s jurisdiction require either an a priori\napproval of Applicant\u2019s holding simultaneous security clearances with the United States\nand Australia, or that failing, relinquishment of his Australian security clearance. To\ndate, Applicant has pursued neither option, and as matters stand, he cannot avail\nhimself of any of the mitigating conditions covered by Guideline L. Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline L.\nForeign influence \nApplicant and his family have deep roots in the United States.  Determined to\nmake a new life for himself and W3, he acquired dual citizenship with Australia, gained\nemployment with an Australian defense organization, and took advantage of the\ncountry\u2019s privileges reserved for Australian citizens and residents: ownership of local\nreal estate, receipt of earned health and pension benefits, and a security clearance\nsponsored by the Australian defense organization who employed him. \nAustralia is a longstanding friend and ally of the United States with core values of\ndemocracy, free markets, and adherence to the rule of law that compares favorably to\nour own. Australia has a security treaty with the Unites States by which each member is\ncommitted to the mutual protection of the other against outside aggressors. Since WW I,\nAustralia has participated in every conflict as a U.S. ally. Since gaining its independence\nfrom the British Crown, Australia has flourished under well-established constitutional\ngovernment and institutional respect for human rights, and has benefitted from its strong\nbilateral security and trade relations with the United States. Foreign ownership of real\nestate within its homeland remains one of the few areas of disagreement between\nAustralia and this country.\nStill, the Government urges trust concerns over risks that Applicant might use his\nU.S. and Australian contacts and security clearances with both countries  to exploit his\nreal estate and other interests he retains in Australia.  Because he has a  security\nclearance and potential Australian clients with needs for his special skills and\nexperience, conceivably, he might be subject to undue foreign influence by Australian\ngovernment authorities to access sensitive proprietary information in Applicant\u2019s\npossession or control. As such, he presents  a potential heightened security risk\ncovered by disqualifying condition  (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the AGs for foreign influence. \nApplicant\u2019s special access through his holding of Australian citizenship and a\nsecurity clearance, combined with his own demonstrated split-preference for the\ncountry, does pose some potential concerns for him because of the risks of undue\nforeign influence that could potentially affect his use of his acquired real estate and\nother gained financial benefits (e.g., his banking protections and his pension benefits) in\nAustralia.  But they do not appear to pose any heightened risks.\n\n20\nApplicant has no immediate family members resident in Australia. However, he\nretains large Australian interests in real estate, bank accounts, and pension interests.\nHe also retains the potential for contacts with Australian government and military\nofficials by virtue of the Australia citizenship and clearance he retains. As a result,\nconsideration of DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is warranted herein.\nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate\nparticular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign\ncountries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the\nsupplied materials and country information about Australia. The AGs do take into\naccount the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United States as an important\nconsideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency\nelsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the\nparticular foreign regime involved do matter. \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  is\nnot fully available to Applicant. For so long as he retains his Australian citizenship and\nsecurity clearance, Applicant poses some risk that could subject him to potential\npressures and influence from Australian government and military officials. \nOf some benefit to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nloyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the United States, are well\ndemonstrated and sufficient under these circumstances to neutralize all potential\nconflicts that are implicit in his professional relationships with Australian government\nand military officials.\n \n Neither MC \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d nor MC \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business,\nfinancial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and\ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual,\u201d are\navailable to  Applicant. His Australian contacts and financial interests are considerable\n\n21\nand account for major reasons why he has been unwilling to renounce his Australian\ncitizenship and relinquish  his Australian security clearance.\nAvailable to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with\nexisting agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats\nfrom persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country.\u201d Applicant has been fully\nforthcoming to date in keeping his U.S. DoD and DoJ official contacts apprised of his\nwork for the Australian government.\nAll told, Applicant\u2019s interests and contacts in Australia, while considerable and\nmanifestly conflicting and potentially conflicting, do not appear to pose heightened risks\nof pressure, coercion, and  influence that could be brought to bear on Applicant, his\nformer colleagues and friends, and family members.  Both Australia\u2019s strong ties to the\nUnited States and Applicant\u2019s longtime support of U.S. defense and security efforts\nminimizes any risk of pressure, coercion, or compromise in the near and foreseeable\nfuture.\nWhole-person assessment is available to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to any\npotential conflicts of interests with Australian government and military officials. His\nformer supervisors and colleagues with his previous U.S. employer and DOJ colleague\nwho worked closely with Applicant on a highly classified U.S. defense project consider\nhim very reliable and trustworthy. And Applicant is not aware of any risks of coercion,\npressure, or influence that he or any of his former colleagues, friends, or family\nmembers might be exposed to.\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's having pension\nrights and property interests in Australia, as well as Australian security clearance, are\nsufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to\nwithstand any Australian  risks of undue influence. Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(a).\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas. 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n22\nSubparas. 2.a and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE L (OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 17 October 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR 5 November 2008, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 15 May 2009. The record in this case\nclosed 17 April 2009, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) was due. Applicant provided no additional information for evaluation.  \nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 44-year-old shipper\nemployed by a U.S. defense contractor since August 2001. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\n \nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, four\ndelinquent debts totaling over $15,000. Applicant accrued these debts after filing for\nchapter 7 bankruptcy protection in May 1997, and receiving a discharge of his\ndischargeable debts\u2014over $20,000\u2014in August 1997.\nIn a January 2008 subject interview (Item 7), Applicant acknowledged that he\nwas in a very bad financial position, living week to week. He admitted that he has a\nhistory of not meeting his financial and credit obligations. He attributed his financial\nproblems to his mismanagement and neglect of his finances. He admitted that he had\nnot sought any financial counseling and had made no efforts to address his delinquent\ndebts.\nThat said, there were more immediate precipitants of his financial problems. For\nexample, Applicant and his common-law wife of several years separated for a time in\n1996, which left Applicant responsible for all the bills. When he was unable to keep up\nwith the payments, he filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1997. He moved to another\nstate with his wife and rebuilt his credit. However, in 2001, his wife\u2019s ex-husband lost his\njob, which meant she was no longer receiving the child support he was obligated to\nsend to her. Although she works part time, that income provides little of the family\nresources and the loss the child support payments again put stress on the family\nbudget.\nApplicant claims, without corroboration, to have made some sporadic payments\nto some of his creditors, but nothing resembling a systematic effort to pay. One of the\ncreditors charged off his debt to profit and loss, so Applicant feels no obligation to repay\nthat creditor. Despite a personal financial statement has shows positive monthly cash\nflow of over $700, Applicant states he lack the means to repay his creditors.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n3\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n3\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which are ongoing.  He received a complete discharge of his\n3\ndischargeable debt in August 1997, yet he has continued to accrue delinquent debt. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were more due to his\n4\nfinancial mismanagement than due to circumstances beyond his control, and he has not\nacted responsibly in addressing his debts.  He has not sought credit counseling, and he\n5\nhas not otherwise brought the problem under control.  None of the debts have been\n6\npaid, much less in a timely, good-faith effort.  Further, given that he has not sought or\n7\nused effective financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that\n\n4\nApplicant will put his financial problems behind him. I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn July 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 14, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on August 25, 2008, and reassigned to me on September 16, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 4, 2008. I convened the hearing \nOctober 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nas scheduled on September 24, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through L, which were received without objection. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional information. Applicant \nsubmitted eight documents, marked AE E through T and admitted without objection.1 \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 8, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a skilled \ntradesman and has worked on the same military installation since 1985. He has worked \nfor various companies as the contracts have changed hands. He is a high school \ngraduate.2  \n \n \nApplicant was married in 1984, and divorced in 1991. He has a 23-year-old child \nfrom that marriage. Applicant paid $410 per month in child support until the child turned \n18 in 2003.3 \n \n \nApplicant married again in 1991. He has a 15-year-old child from this marriage. \nThey separated in 2002, after his second wife left the home, and divorced in 2004. She \ndeveloped psychological problems during the marriage and was hospitalized on two \noccasions for her condition. Her illness forced her to resign from her job in 1997. \nApplicant was unable to pay their debts, which included her numerous medical bills. He \nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998, and his debts were discharged the same year. He \nfell behind on his debts again and filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2001. He attempted to \nmaintain the payments to the trustee, but was unable to do so. The Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy was dismissed in August 2002, and re-filed the same month.4 \n \n \nAfter his second wife left him, Applicant attempted to pay the trustee on his \nincome alone, but could not keep up the payments. His wife had custody of their child. \nApplicant was ordered to pay $750 per month in child support. He paid the child support \nuntil November 2006, when he obtained custody of their child. His second wife does not \npay child support for this child. The bankruptcy was dismissed in March 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed and he lost his house to foreclosure. There was no \ndeficiency owed on the mortgage.5 \n                                                          \n1 Applicant provided several documents about his bankruptcy immediately following the hearing. \nThe documents were submitted again in the more extensive package submitted by Applicant on October \n10, 2008. I have not separately marked the documents received immediately after the hearing. \n \n2 Tr. at 19-21; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 19-22; GE 1; AE E. \n \n4 Tr. at 22-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE E, F. \n \n5 Tr. at 23-24, 37-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn about 2002, Applicant started having back problems which caused him to miss \nwork. He is also diabetic. In March 2004, Applicant had a series of seizures which led to \na very serious brain illness. He was hospitalized for about four to six weeks over a two \nmonth period. He had hallucinations and was catatonic at times. He was out of work for \nabout six months. He eventually had some recovery. He suffered long term memory \nloss. He does not remember many of the debts that were discussed at the hearing, but \nassumed he was responsible for them because of the supporting documentation. \nApplicant has continued to have medical problems which has resulted in numerous \ndoctor visits and unpaid time off work. Applicant\u2019s Social Security statement shows his \nannual earnings increasing every year until it topped out at $50,000 in 2002. It then \nstarted declining because of unpaid time off work for medical reasons. He earned \n$44,000 in 2003; $30,000 in 2004; $34,000 in 2005; $35,000 in 2006; and $36,000 in \n2007.6 \n \n \nApplicant married for the third time in 2004. His wife developed severe medical \nproblems. She has a debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease. She is unable \nto work and is essentially bedridden. He and his wife separated in about January 2007, \nwhen he was no longer able to care for her. She has returned to live with her parents \nwho are retired and able to provide full-time care for her. She is covered by his health \ninsurance, but there continues to be numerous medical expenses above what is paid by \nthe insurance.7 \n \n \nThe SOR lists 28 delinquent debts. Applicant admitted to owing all the debts in \nthe SOR with explanations, with the exception of \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.q, which he denied. He \nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. The 26 debts that he admitted he owes total approximately $22,657. Of \nthose 26 debts, 22 are medical debts. Applicant has not ignored his medical debts, but \nhas paid whatever he could. The medical debts in the SOR reflect those medical debts \nabove what he has been able to pay.8  \n \n \nThe largest debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.v, is to an automobile finance company for \n$11,194. Applicant admitted the debt was for a car loan after his car was repossessed \nfollowing the dismissal of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The debt is listed on the July 11, \n2007 credit report, with a balance of $11,194 and a high credit of $13,394. It is not clear \nwhether $11,194 reflects what was owed on the loan after repossession or the \ndeficiency balance owed on the loan after the car was sold at auction. The June 24, \n2008 credit report lists a debt to the same automobile finance company but shows the \ndebt as \u201cclosed or paid account/zero balance.\u201d This is likely a second car loan. If it is a \nsecond car loan, then the debt alleged in the SOR is not listed on the credit report.9 \n \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 24-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F, G, I, J \n \n7 Tr. at 33-37. \n \n8 Tr. at 27-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n9 Tr. at 37-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $209 to a collection company, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. He stated that the original creditor was a phone/internet/cable provider and \nhe was current on the debt. He also denied SOR \u00b6 1.q, which alleges that he is $610 \npast due on a car loan, with a balance of $17,355. Applicant provided documentation \nthat while he may have been late on payments, he is currently up-to-date on his \npayments and in good standing on the loan.10 \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2008. He listed only one secured \nclaim, his auto loan as discussed above. He reaffirmed this debt. Under Schedule E \u2013 \nCreditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, he listed back taxes owed to the IRS for \ntax years 2005 and 2006, in the total amount of $4,369. Schedule F \u2013 Creditors Holding \nUnsecured Nonpriority Claims listed 42 creditors and debts totaling $16,895.11  \n \n \nApplicant has received counseling pursuant to his bankruptcy. He also joined an \non-line service that provides advice and answers on money management and personal \nfinances. He has a booklet from the company and has referenced it extensively. He has \nestablished a budget and is working diligently at maintaining the budget and not \nincurring new delinquent debts.12  \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous letters of appreciation and character letters stating \nhe is honest, trustworthy, responsible, professional, and reliable; a man of sound moral \nprinciples and integrity; and a real asset to his employer and the U.S. military.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 39-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-3; AE A, O. \n \n11 Tr. at 41-47; AE Q-T. The tax debts were not alleged in the SOR and are not considered for \ndisqualifying purposes. They are considered for the purposes of determining mitigation and under the \nwhole person.  \n \n12 Tr. at 32-34; AE B, H, Q, R.  \n \n13 AE K, L. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He recently filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, but the debts have not yet been discharged. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable at \nthis time.  \n \n \nApplicant and his family have had extensive medical problems causing him to \nhave much unpaid time off work and leaving him with large medical bills. He is a \ndiabetic with back problems and was hospitalized with a serious brain illness in 2004. \nHe was out of work for about six months. He is still recovering from that illness and has \nlong term memory loss. His wife\u2019s medical conditions became so severe that Applicant \ncould no longer care for her and she moved back to live with her retired parents who \ncould provide her with full-time care. His former wife developed psychological problems \nrequiring much medical attention and two hospitalizations. These are conditions that \n\n \n7 \n \nwere beyond his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the \nindividual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not been able to pay \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. He has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a \nlegally viable option to handle one\u2019s burdensome debts. The Supreme Court made this \npoint about the purpose of the bankruptcy law in a 1934 decision: \n \n[I]t gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor . . . a new opportunity in life \nand a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and \ndiscouragement of preexisting debt.14 \n \nApplicant is the very definition of \u201chonest but unfortunate debtor.\u201d Under the limited \ncircumstances of this case, I find that he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable.  \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling. He has filed bankruptcy, which will \nprovide him a clean start. There are clear indications that the problem is being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable.  \n \nApplicant has been unable to pay his delinquent debts. Bankruptcy will resolve \nhis debts, but AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because he has not taken \u201cgood faith\u201d \nsteps to pay or resolve his debts other than filing for bankruptcy.15 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n                                                          \n14 Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). \n15 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No.  99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a decent, hard-working \nman who has endured many trials and tribulations. His second wife had many \npsychological problems, resulting in numerous medical bills, hospitalizations, and the \nloss of her job and income. He was financially devastated and had his debts discharged \nin bankruptcy in 1998. He was unable to stay out from under financial distress and filed \na Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2001 and 2002. He could not maintain the payments to the \ntrustee and both bankruptcies were dismissed. Applicant started having his own medical \nissues in about 2002. He had back problems and is a diabetic. He was out of work for \nsix months in 2004, due to a severe brain illness, for which he is still recovering. His \nSocial Security statement documents how his income has declined because of unpaid \ntime off work. His current wife is a bedridden invalid. Her medical condition deteriorated \nto where she had to move back to live with her retired parents, who could provide her \nwith the full-time care that she requires.  \n \nAs a result of all the above, Applicant incurred much delinquent debt. At least 22 \nof the SOR allegations are medical debts. Applicant has taken his only viable option, \nand filed for bankruptcy in July 2008. He is attempting to manage his finances. He \nattended counseling, utilizes an on-line money management service, and established a \nbudget. His unpaid taxes, while not alleged in the SOR, are a concern. However, once \nhis debts are discharged in bankruptcy, he will be able to address his taxes.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.ee:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "findings of fact under Guideline F: In 2002, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife charged about $15,000 on Applicant\u2019s credit card without Applicant\u2019s knowledge. Applicant quit his job for personal reasons in the spring of 2005 and was without full- time employment until the middle of 2006. In the meantime, Applicant undertook a series of \u201cside jobs\u201d to cover daily expenses and child support, but did not have the means to pay older debts. More obligations became delinquent. Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2006, but withdrew the petition on the advice of his mother and friends. Applicant began a six-month job in mid-2006. Applicant accepted a government position in February 2007, although difficulty in obtaining a security clearance caused a change in his position. Applicant continued to work for the government until January 2008. At that time, Applicant resigned his government job to accept a position in a private company after he was erroneously assured that he had been granted a security clearance. Applicant was still unemployed at the time of the hearing, but had job offers pending the outcome of the security clearance process. Applicant has paid off one of the debts listed in the SOR in the amount of $660.

On July 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 15, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   \n1\nSpecifically, Applicant restates the reasons for his financial situation and his efforts to\nimprove it.  Applicant contends that the Judge should have found that his financial situation was\nmitigated.  In the alternative, Applicant requests that a decision on his security request be postponed\nuntil he is able to improve his financial situation to allow a favorable security clearance decision.\nFinding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact under Guideline F: In 2002,\nApplicant\u2019s estranged wife charged about $15,000 on Applicant\u2019s credit card without Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge.  Applicant quit his job for personal reasons in the spring of 2005 and was without full-\ntime employment until the middle of 2006.  In the meantime, Applicant undertook a series of \u201cside\njobs\u201d to cover daily expenses and child support, but did not have the means to pay older debts.  More\nobligations became delinquent.  Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2006, but withdrew the petition\non the advice of his mother and friends.  Applicant began a six-month job in mid-2006.  Applicant\naccepted a government position in February 2007, although difficulty in obtaining a security\nclearance caused a change in his position.  Applicant continued to work for the government until\nJanuary 2008.  At that time, Applicant resigned his government job to accept a position in a private\ncompany after he was erroneously assured that he had been granted a security clearance.  Applicant\nwas still unemployed at the time of the hearing, but had job offers pending the outcome of the\nsecurity clearance process. \nApplicant has paid off one of the debts listed in the SOR in the amount of $660.  He does not\nbelieve one of the debts is his, but  has not demonstrated that he disputed that debt to the appropriate\nauthorities.  Except for the $660 debt, Applicant\u2019s debts remain substantially unpaid or unaddressed.\nApplicant indicates that he has contacted a debt consolidation firm.  They will act on his behalf to\nfile for bankruptcy for him after he pays their service fee of $1,551.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n\n3\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a\nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App.\nBd. Nov. 23, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines,\nInc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nsecurity clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable. \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s alternative request that the security clearance process be\npostponed until his financial situation has improved, the Board has no authority to grant such an\naction.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned; Michael D.

On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant admitted six of eight financial allegations  and\n1\nadmitted one of two criminal conduct allegations. A request for hearing was received on\nDecember 15, 2008\n\n Tr. 21.\n2\n Tr. 21-23.\n3\n2\nAugust 27, 2008, and I was assigned the case on August 29, 2008. Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel proposed a hearing date of September 16, 2008. Applicant waived\nthe 15-day notice requirement. A notice of hearing was issued on September 4, 2008,\nsetting the hearing for the proposed date.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits,\nwhich were accepted into the record as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5 without objection. Applicant\nrepresented himself and gave testimony; no witnesses were called. Applicant presented\nno exhibits. He was given until October 1, 2008, to submit any documents for\nconsideration. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 25, 2008. On September\n29, 2008, Applicant submitted seven documents for review by Department Counsel.\nDepartment Counsel forwarded those documents to me on October 3, 2008, without\nobjection. I accepted them into the record as Exs. A-G on October 6, 2008, and the\nrecord was closed. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old Electronic Engineer II applying for a position with a\ndefense contractor. He has associate degrees in both general science and in electronic\nengineering. Applicant served in the military from 1995 through 1997. Divorced,\nApplicant has two minor children. He is currently engaged to marry.\nAs Applicant and his ex-wife prepared for divorce in 2002, state law required that\nthey live apart for one year.  While estranged, and without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, she\n2\nbought about $15,000 in new furniture and redecorated the house using Applicant\u2019s\ncredit card account.  Not knowing about the purchase, the credit card account went\n3\nunpaid or underpaid. As a result, interest and fees raised the balance to about $20,000.\nAfter Applicant\u2019s divorce in 2003, Applicant was required to attend a number of\ncourt hearings in another state concerning his young daughter. The trips detracted from\nhis work, which required significant travel. Fearing he would be fired for absenteeism,\nApplicant quit his job in the spring of 2005. As a consequence, he was without full-time\nemployment until the middle of 2006. To meet his daily expenses and child support, he\nundertook a string of side jobs, often being paid under the table. There was no money\nleftover, however, to pay older debts. Some of those debts, like the furniture bill, dated\nback to his marriage. Several more obligations became delinquent. In early 2006,\nApplicant filed for bankruptcy. He withdrew the petition when his mother and friends\nadvised him that it was a bad idea. They suggested it would be better for him to pay off\nhis debts himself. Shortly thereafter, he was offered a job. \n\n Tr. 23.\n4\n Tr. 34.\n5\n Tr. 35.\n6\n Tr. 23-24.\n7\n Tr. 25.\n8\n SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. 19-22. \n9\n3\nThe new job was for six months and it started in mid-2006, around the time\nApplicant and his fiancee had their son.  Around September 28, 2006, Applicant\n4\nattended a bachelor\u2019s party and consumed more alcohol than he was accustomed to\nconsuming. He became heavily intoxicated.  After the party, friends dropped him off in\n5\nfront of the wrong apartment. When he could not get his key to work on the door lock,\nhe kicked the door in. He then went to sleep on the stoop, where a neighbor saw him\nand called the police. He was arrested and charged with Felony Breaking and Entering,\nLarceny, and Possession of Stolen Property. The next morning, he went to apologize to\nthe elderly neighbor whose door he had broken. Being on friendly terms, he explained\nwhat had happened. Two days later, she dropped all charges and the matter never\nwent to court.  He now refrains from alcohol.\n6\nAround January 1, 2007, Applicant\u2019s mother called him and asked him to come\nover. She wanted him to evict his 18-year-old nephew from her home. His mother, who\nlives on an assisted living allowance, had allowed the troubled teen to stay with her.\nShe then discovered he had stolen $500 from her and she wanted him out. When\nApplicant arrived, he physically removed the resistant nephew from the residence.\nLater, after Applicant had returned home, police arrived. Based on the young man\u2019s\nstory, he was arrested for Misdemeanor Assault, by Pointing a Gun, Misdemeanor\nAssault with a Deadly Weapon, and Simple Assault. In March 2007, Applicant\nexplained the situation to the judge. The judge instructed the District Attorney to drop\nthe charges. The charges were then dropped.\nApplicant\u2019s six month long project was followed by an offer for a government\nposition. He accepted the offer and started work in February 2007. Difficulty obtaining a\nsecurity clearance, however, made Applicant ineligible for the position and he briefly\nworked in a different capacity until January 2008.  In January 2008, he was told that he\n7\nhad been granted a security clearance.  Hearing that news, he tendered his two week\n8\nnotice in anticipation of a private sector position. Since that time he has been without\nfull-time employment. The SOR starting this process was issued on July 24, 2008.\nThe SOR noted seven delinquent debts. The largest is the debt for the furniture\npurchased by Applicant\u2019s then-estranged wife. That debt now has a balance of\napproximately $20,502.  He has made sporadic payments on the debt, but the\n9\nminimum payments now required are too large for him to pay. Similarly, he made about\n\n SOR \u00b6 1.I; Tr. 25.\n10\n SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 26-27.\n11\n SOR\u00b6 1.g; Tr. 28-29.\n12\n SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 26-27.\n13\n SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 28.\n14\n SOR \u00b6 1.f; Tr. 31-32; Ex. G (Account statement showing zero balance); Ex. 3 (Interrogatories) at 20-21.\n15\n Tr. 43.\n16\n Tr. 44-45.\n17\n Tr. 46. Applicant has received a $450 per month disability payment since his discharge from the military in\n18\n1997. Tr. 65.\n Tr. 44, 46.\n19\n Tr. 96.\n20\n4\ntwo payments on an account for furniture storage, but its minimum payments also got\ntoo expensive. That account has a remaining balance of about $3,543.   \n10\nThe same situation took place with a creditor to whom he owes $1,914  and one\n11\nto which he owes $1,988.  He and his fiancee have plans to start paying off an\n12\nobligation owed to an apartment complex for approximately $585. That account was\nopened in April 2006 and shows a date of last activity as January 2008. No payments\nhave thus far been made on this balance.  \n13\nApplicant does not recognize the debt noted in the SOR showing a balance of\n$461,  nor has he formally disputed its inclusion on his credit bureau report. Applicant\n14\ndid, however, pay off one of the debts at issue: He has satisfied the obligation noted as\nhaving an approximate balance of $660.  \n15\nApplicant has been working with a debt consolidation company. His consolidated\ndebt represents approximately $21,000.  As part of that consolidation, they are poised\n16\nto file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on his behalf once he can satisfy the company\u2019s filing fee\nof $1,551.  Payments toward that amount commenced in October 2008. Currently\n17\nunemployed, his initial payments are set to be drawn from a disability payment.  It is\n18\nhis hope to soon be employed and convert the Chapter 7 bankruptcy to a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy.19\nTo save money, Applicant now lives with his sister. Applicant no longer uses\ncredit cards. He is scheduled to attend a debt class once he has paid the bankruptcy\nfiling charge to the debt consolidation company.  He has an offer letter for a position\n20\nshould he obtain a security clearance, as well as an offer for a less profitable position\n\n Tr. 33-34.\n21\n Exs. B-E (Recommendations).\n22\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n23\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n24\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n25\n5\nwhich does not require a security clearance.  His recommendations are highly\n21\ncomplimentary and reflect a thoughtful, sensible, competent individual.22\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n23\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n24\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n25\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n Id.\n26\n Id.\n27\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n28\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n29\n6\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n26\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n27\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n28\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the most pertinent to the\nevaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n29\nunder this guideline.  \nStarting with his wife\u2019s purchase of furniture for their house in 2002 through\nsometime after the rental of an apartment in April 2006, Applicant accrued at least\nseven delinquent debts, amounting to approximately $29,700. Of that amount, only one\ndebt has been paid, reducing that sum by about $660. The rest of the debts remain\nsubstantially unpaid and unaddressed. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n\n7\n(FC DC) AG \u00b6 19\u00a9) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6\n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised,\nthe burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nApplicant has experienced two significant and protracted periods of\nunemployment. Both, however, were voluntary departures initiated on Applicant\u2019s own\nvolition. His 2005-2006 unemployment came about when he quit his job rather than risk\nbeing fired for his absenteeism. He later chose to leave federal employment for the\nprivate sector on word that he had been granted a security clearance before waiting for\nmore substantial evidence. Neither period of unemployment, therefore, is the type\ncontemplated under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6\n20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d). The acquisition of about $20,000 in new furniture without his\nknowledge by his estranged wife, however, is sufficient to invoke that mitigating\ncondition since about two-thirds of Applicant\u2019s total delinquent debt is the result of her\nbehavior.\nTwice since the spring of 2005, Applicant has voluntarily left a position. Each\ntime he faced a protracted period without full-time employment. Cumulatively, he has\nlacked full-time employment for about two of the past four years. This has directly\nimpacted his ability to pay his bills. Still unemployed to date, only one of his smaller\nobligations has been satisfied and he has lacked the funds to proceed with a\nbankruptcy filing. Given these facts, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) 1, AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply. \nApplicant testified that he made occasional payments on some of his delinquent\naccounts until his efforts were rebuffed by demands for minimum payments he could\nnot afford. Without records of such payments and demands, it is impossible to gauge\nthe nature of these efforts. Based on his depiction, however, FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d),\n(\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d) does not apply.\nWhile Applicant has met with a debt consolidation company, there is no evidence\nhe has received financial counseling or will receive any finance education until after he\nhas filed for bankruptcy. With only one of the smaller obligations being satisfied in the\npast few years and with his bankruptcy yet to be filed, Applicant\u2019s poor financial\nsituation remains largely unaddressed. FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20\u00a9 (\u201cthe person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) cannot apply. \nWhile the majority of Applicant\u2019s debt may have been created without his\nknowledge, he has done little to address any of his delinquent obligations in the interim.\n\n8\nHe has demonstrated questionable judgment by neglecting his financial obligations\nwhile he has maneuvered his career. This has led to his debts still lingering,\nunaddressed, and unmoved from where they were in early 2006 when he first petitioned\nfor bankruptcy.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits he was arrested\ntwice for the charges cited, giving rise to Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC\nDC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CC DC, AG \u00b6\n31\u00a9 (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted).\nApplicant had the misfortune of being arrested over two odd and very\nuncharacteristic incidents within a very short time. The case files are devoid of any hint\nof other arrests or wrong-doing. In the first instance, Applicant, in rare form, celebrated\ntoo much at a friend\u2019s bachelor party. He sensibly did not drive home. Vexed he could\nnot get his key to work on his apartment door, he kicked the door in. The only problem\nwas, it was not his door. Recognizing that the act was uncharacteristic, the renter\ndeclined to press charges. The matter was dropped without objection, and a contrite\nand embarrassed Applicant made restitution for the damage. He has refrained from\nalcohol since that time. Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d)\n(\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d)\napply.\nSimilarly, when Applicant\u2019s mother could not get her troubled and troublesome\ngrandson to leave her home after she discovered he had stolen $500 from her, she\ncalled for Applicant\u2019s assistance. Applicant arrived and physically removed the young\nman from the premises and sent him on his way. Bent on making a family matter public,\nthe nephew told the police a different version, involving guns and threats. The matter\nwas soon resolved and dropped. Again, the same two mitigating conditions noted\nabove apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s\nhighly credible testimony. He is a mature, direct, and candid individual with a fine work\n\n9\nrecord and a notable record for community service. A \u201cwhole person\u201d evaluation was\nalso conducted.\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c) the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant is an intelligent, educated man with professional aspirations and a\ndesire to excel. With regard to his finances and his debt, however, he has made some\npoor choices. Rather than work with his employers or the court system, he quit his job\nin 2005 in fear that his absenteeism would lead to his being fired. As a result, he relied\non \u201cside jobs\u201d for a year which could barely sustain him financially. Without waiting for\nwritten confirmation that he had been granted a security clearance and otherwise\nmaking sure he was ready for a smooth transition into his private sector position, he\ngave two weeks notice to his government employer, unaware his security clearance\napplication had not yet been granted. As a result, almost an entire year was again lost\nwithout full-time employment. More recently, he has put a job offer that does not require\na security clearance on hold pending resolution of this process, in hopes he can qualify\nfor a more lucrative position that requires a security clearance. \nThroughout this time, from 2005 to date, Applicant has satisfied only one debt \u2013\nfor approximately $660. During that time he failed to dispute one debt that he does not\nrecognize. Given the few documents introduced for consideration as evidence, he also\nfailed to document those occasional payments he alleges he has made to other\ncreditors. In seeking dismissal of his earlier bankruptcy petition, Applicant thought it\nbest to pay off the debts himself. A little over two years later, he is unable to pay for a\nprofessional bankruptcy filing. Had Applicant been more committed to sustaining\nemployment in order to be able to meet his obligations or had he continued with his\nprevious bankruptcy filing, his debts might be paid and a record of financial stability\nestablished. Instead, Applicant\u2019s debt remains virtually unchanged and security\nconcerns regarding his finances remain unmitigated.\nAs for criminal conduct security concerns, Applicant\u2019s depiction of the two\nincidents helped explain why the charges were so readily dropped. An uncharacteristic\nnight of carousing and its repercussions were remedied through contrition, restitution,\nand the understanding of a neighbor. Significantly, Applicant has since refrained from\nalcohol, demonstrating sound judgment and level-headed personal conduct. Moreover,\n\n For consistency with the SOR, there is no Subparagraph 1.d.\n30\n10\nfalse accusations by a troubled thief were easily set straight. Neither incident calls into\nquestion his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Criminal\nconduct security concerns are mitigated.\nApplicant is young and, assuming they are carried out, his current bankruptcy\nplans should help remedy his current financial problem. At present, however, Applicant\nwas unable to present sufficient evidence of tangible progress on his debts to mitigate\nfinancial considerations security concerns. Therefore, I conclude that it is not clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n30\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations concerning his criminal conduct and alcohol consumption. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings. Applicant is a 35-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He worked for his present employer from February 1997, shortly after graduation from college, until March 2006 when he was fired for excessive absences. After arbitration, he was reinstated in August 2007. He held a security clearance from 1997 until his termination, and submitted the present application upon his reinstatement. He has never married, and has no children. (GE 1 at 6, 10-13, 15, 20, 26; Tr. at 28-29, 67-70.) On December 2, 2000, Applicant attended a birthday party at a friend\u2019s house. Over the course of about seven hours he drank many beers. At around 2:00 the next morning he decided to drive home. He was stopped by police, failed roadside sobriety and breath alcohol tests, and was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He eventually pled guilty to and was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to one day in jail, two years of probation, 40 hours of community service, and fined. He was also required to attend an alcohol awareness course, a DUI victims\u2019 panel, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days. (GE 1 at 23; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 65-66, 73; Tr. at 47-51.) During May 2001, he went to a bar with some friends at about 9:00 p.m. one evening. After consuming many beers, he l",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Laura Anderson, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was convicted of Driving Under the Influence (DUI) in 2000, 2001,\n2004, and 2006. He was convicted of driving while his license was suspended in 2006\nand 2007. He is on probation until 2011. Security concerns were insufficiently mitigated.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on September 17, 2007.\nOn December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J\n(Criminal Conduct) and G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nSeptember 14, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 6, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 3, 2009, and requested an administrative determination\nof his case without a hearing before an administrative judge. After receiving the File of\nRelevant Materials provided by Department Counsel pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7,\nApplicant obtained representation by his above-named counsel. She entered her\nappearance on April 6, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge\non Applicant\u2019s behalf. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 7, 2009,\nand the case was assigned to me on May 21, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing\non June 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 23, 2009. The\nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant offered exhibits (AE) A and B, which were also admitted without objection,\nand testified on his own behalf. Three other witnesses also testified for him. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until July 17, 2009, to permit him to submit\na written closing argument by counsel. On that date, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted the\nclosing argument to Department Counsel, who forwarded it without objection to its\nconsideration. This argument was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) II, and the record was\nclosed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations\nconcerning his criminal conduct and alcohol consumption. His admissions are\nincorporated into the following findings. Applicant is a 35-year-old engineer employed by\na defense contractor. He worked for his present employer from February 1997, shortly\nafter graduation from college, until March 2006 when he was fired for excessive\nabsences. After arbitration, he was reinstated in August 2007. He held a security\nclearance from 1997 until his termination, and submitted the present application upon\nhis reinstatement. He has never married, and has no children. (GE 1 at 6, 10-13, 15, 20,\n26; Tr. at 28-29, 67-70.)\nOn December 2, 2000, Applicant attended a birthday party at a friend\u2019s house.\nOver the course of about seven hours he drank many beers. At around 2:00 the next\nmorning he decided to drive home. He was stopped by police, failed roadside sobriety\nand breath alcohol tests, and was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He\neventually pled guilty to and was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to one day in jail,\ntwo years of probation, 40 hours of community service, and fined. He was also required\nto attend an alcohol awareness course, a DUI victims\u2019 panel, and his driver\u2019s license\nwas suspended for 90 days. (GE 1 at 23; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 65-66, 73; Tr. at 47-51.)\nDuring May 2001, he went to a bar with some friends at about 9:00 p.m. one\nevening. After consuming many beers, he left the bar at about 1:30 a.m. to drive to a\nfriend\u2019s house. He was stopped by police, again failed roadside sobriety and blood\nalcohol tests, and was arrested for DUI. He was granted a deferred prosecution, under\nwhich he was required to pay a $1,000 fine, to serve five years probation, and attend\nintensive outpatient alcohol treatment for two years. (GE 1 at 22-23; GE 3 at 66, 73.)\n\n3\nApplicant successfully underwent his court-ordered outpatient alcohol treatment\nfrom June 2001 to June 2003, but resumed occasional drinking thereafter. (GE 3 at 66,\n72; Tr. at 51-54.) In September 2004, he attended another birthday party at a friend\u2019s\nhouse. He began drinking heavily at about 10:00 p.m., and continued to do so until he\nleft at around 3:00 a.m. to find a restaurant for breakfast. He was again stopped by\npolice while driving and, after failing sobriety and blood alcohol tests, arrested for DUI.\nHe later pled guilty to DUI and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he served on\nwork release, 120 days of electronic home monitoring, fined $1,200, five years of\nprobation, and a one-year suspension of his driver\u2019s license. He was also ordered to\nattend another DUI victims\u2019 panel and outpatient alcohol treatment. (GE 1 at 22; GE 3 at\n67, 73; Tr. at 53-55.)\nApplicant attended outpatient alcohol treatment from October 2004 to October\n2005, when he successfully completed the program. (GE 3 at 67, 72; Tr. at 56.) He later\nresumed drinking on weekends with friends. On February 17, 2006, he went to a bar to\ndrink by himself at around 10:00 p.m. after his girlfriend told him she wanted to break\nup. At around 12:30 a.m., after about six beers, he left to drive home. He stopped to buy\ngas, but the store attendant refused to sell him any because he detected Applicant\u2019s\nintoxication. Applicant was stopped by the police shortly after leaving the store, again\nfailed roadside sobriety and blood alcohol tests, and was arrested for DUI. In March\n2006, he pled guilty to DUI and was sentenced to 365 days in jail (with 275 days\nsuspended), 120 days of electronic home monitoring, fined $1,200, five years of\nprobation, and a one-year suspension of his driver\u2019s license. He was also ordered to\nundergo inpatient alcohol treatment. He will remain on probation until sometime in 2011.\n(GE 1 at 21; GE 2; GE 3 at 68, 73; Tr. at 56-57.)\nApplicant completed his jail time in late April 2006 and entered a three-week\ninpatient alcohol treatment program. He then entered outpatient treatment again in\nAugust 2006, as an after-care program, which he continued until February 2007. On\nMarch 1, 2007, he was discharged after successful completion of his Relapse\nPrevention Treatment Program. His final chemical dependency counselor testified that\nApplicant is alcohol-dependent, and was in full compliance with all treatment protocols\nand met all of his treatment goals. This counselor is a state-licensed Chemical\nDependency Professional with an associate\u2019s degree, but is neither a medical\nprofessional nor a licensed clinical social worker. Applicant continues to attend\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings about once a week. (GE 1 at 24-25; GE 3 at 68-69, 72;\nAE A; Tr. at 60, 135-166.) \n During December 2006, Applicant was employed by a different company about\n45 or 50 miles away from his residence. He normally rode in a van pool, but on\nDecember 5, 2006, he drove. A policeman pulled him over for some reason and learned\nthat his license was suspended and arrested him. A month or so later, he pled guilty to\ndriving with a suspended license, and was fined $400. By November 2007, he had been\nreinstated with his current employer. Although he normally took the bus, a van pool, or\nhis bike to work, he was late on the morning of November 2, 2007, and decided to drive.\nHe was pulled over for speeding eight  miles per hour over the limit in a school zone,\n\n4\nand also cited for driving with a suspended license 1  degree and driving without\nst\ninsurance. The court records reflect his conviction on all three of these charges on\nJanuary 29, 2008. He was sentenced to 365 days in jail, with 355 days suspended for\ntwo years, and fines totaling about $600, with the sentence to be served consecutive to\nsome other punishments for violating probation. Applicant reported paying total fines of\n$1,000 to $1,500 and 60 to 80 days in jail, which he served through home monitoring for\n120 days. (GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 64, 69-70, 73-75; Tr. at 61-63, 72-74.)  \nApplicant has not consumed alcohol since February 18, 2006. He moved to new\nhousing accommodations where he now lives alone, and no longer spends time with his\nformer drinking buddies. He has resumed exercising and eating healthy meals. (Tr. at\n31-39.) His boss since his reinstatement and a coworker who has known him for ten\nyears both testified to his outstanding work performance. In the past year, despite not\nhaving a security clearance, he has been rewarded with a substantially above-average\npay increase and an upgrade in his retention level rating. He never violated security\nprocedures during the nine years he held his original security clearance, and he has\nscrupulously followed procedures for protection of both classified and unclassified but\nsensitive trade-restricted information since his return to employment. (AE B; Tr. at 28-\n30, 79-132.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\n\n5\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying (DCs). The three DCs asserted by the Government were, \u201c(a)\na single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d \u201c(c) allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted, or convicted;\u201d and \u201c(d) the individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\n(Tr. at 169.) \nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant was arrested and convicted for four separate\nDUI offenses in 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2006. He was also convicted of driving with a\nsuspended license in December 2006 and again in November 2007. He has been on\nprobation since his early 2001 conviction for his first DUI, and will remain on probation\nuntil 2011 if he avoids committing further criminal offenses. The evidence fully supports\nsecurity concerns under the DCs set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), and (d). \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs). These\nare: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\n6\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and his criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. His pattern of multiple DUI\noffenses, followed by two separate convictions for driving illegally while his license was\nsuspended demonstrate a willingness to flaunt rules and regulations. Given the lengthy\nand repetitive nature of his criminal history, Applicant did not establish strong mitigation\nof the concerns arising therefrom. His pattern of alcohol relapses leading to subsequent\nDUI offenses within a few months or years after completing alcohol treatment programs,\nand his choices to drive illegally without a license when it suited his convenience,\npreclude substantial mitigation under MC 32(a). His offenses were so frequent and\nsimilar that insufficient time has passed to support a reasonable conclusion that\nrecurrence is unlikely or his judgment has permanently improved. He made no showing\nthat he was pressured or coerced into any of his criminal acts to support application of\nMC 32(b). Although he is alcohol-dependent, that fact has not changed and each of his\nDUI offenses was preceded by totally voluntary consumption of excessive alcohol. \nApplicant admitted that he committed each SOR-listed criminal offense, and he\nwas formally convicted of each of them, so MC 32(c) has no application. Applicant\u2019s\nrecent excellent employment record, and his abstinence from alcohol since successful\ncompletion of his inpatient and outpatient treatment programs in 2006 and 2007,\nprovide evidence that begins to demonstrate rehabilitation. The recency and repetitive\nnature of his criminal activity, however, leads to the conclusion that on balance it is still\ntoo soon to be confident that such behavior is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s two non-alcohol-\nrelated and intentional criminal driving violations, neither of which had reasonable\njustification, and the most recent of which was less that two years ago, further preclude\na finding of substantial mitigation under MC 32(d).\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DC supported by the SOR allegation and asserted by Department\n\n7\nCounsel is \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d Applicant\u2019s four admitted DUI offenses clearly raise security\nconcerns under this DC. Facts supporting other potentially applicable alcohol\nconsumption DCs were not alleged in the SOR, so independent analysis of security\nconcerns arising from those DCs is not appropriate.  \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents were frequent and, when viewed in the\ncontext of his multiple relapses within six months to three years, his 2006 DUI remains\nrelatively recent. He resumed drinking after each of his first three DUI convictions,\ndespite successful completion of two outpatient treatment programs. His resumed\nabstinence since his 2006 DUI is of insufficient duration to establish that such conduct is\nunlikely to recur or no longer casts doubt on his reliability. Applicant did not establish\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant has acknowledged his alcoholism, and has\nbegun to demonstrate effective action to overcome it, but he has yet to establish a\npattern of abstinence sufficient to overcome concerns raised by his previous relapses. \nThere is no evidence that he has consumed alcohol since February 2006, and he\nhas made a substantial start toward establishing a pattern of responsible conduct and\n\n8\nabstinence. However, as discussed above, insufficient time has passed to establish\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b) given the duration, pattern, and seriousness of his history\nof alcohol abuse. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence yet to support mitigation under\neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) or (d), due to his history of relapses after previous alcohol treatment\nprograms. He is taking proper and commendable measures to create future mitigation\nunder these provisions, but has not yet done so sufficiently to overcome the security\nconcerns raised by his serious alcohol abuse.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved multiple DUI offenses over six years, followed by two probation-\nviolating offenses of driving while his license was suspended. All occurred while he was\nfully mature and accountable for his actions. None of the incidents in and of itself was\nparticularly serious since he was fortunately arrested before hurting himself or others.\nTaken together, however, they form a pattern reflecting very poor judgment, flaunting of\nrules and regulations, and inadequate self-control. He knowingly and voluntarily\nparticipated in every incident of security concern, and failed to take necessary steps to\nchange the circumstances under which his problems recurred until fairly recently. It has\nbeen less than two years since his most recent offense, and he remains on probation\nuntil 2011. The substantial suspended punishment facing Applicant for another criminal\nviolation lessens the degree to which his recent good behavior can be attributed to real\nremorse and rehabilitation. While evidence of an excellent start toward establishing\nrehabilitation was presented, including his recent outstanding work performance,\nlifestyle changes and abstinence from alcohol, it is too soon to confidently conclude that\n\n9\ncontinuation or recurrence of his criminal conduct or alcohol problems are unlikely. He\nmade insufficient showing of reduced potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress.\nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Although his recent efforts have\nbeen commendable, he has not yet met his burden to mitigate the security concerns\narising from his criminal conduct and alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on July 13, 2007. On October 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 30, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 6, 2008. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. On \nDecember 3, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for \nDecember 19, 2008. The hearing was held, as scheduled. During the hearing, it was \ndiscovered Applicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing 15 days prior to the Notice of \nHearing as required by the Directive. Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. \nFebruary 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(Tr at 12) The Government offered six exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1-6 without objection. The Applicant offered three exhibits which were \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - C. Applicant testified and called one witness. \nThe transcript was received on December 29, 2008. The record was held open until \nJanuary 15, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He timely \nsubmitted a seven-page document which was admitted as AE D. The record closed on \nJanuary 15, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his current employer since June  \n2006. He has held a security clearance for over 25 years with no security violations. \nFrom August 22, 1980, to May 31, 1988, he served on active duty in the United States \nArmy. He separated at the grade of Captain and received an honorable discharge. He  \nworked for numerous defense contractors since separating from active duty. The \nhighest level of education he has achieved is a Masters of Science in Systems \nManagement. He is single and has no children. (Tr at 4-7, 32-33, 68; Gov 1; AE B)   \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was a college student in 1977. He \ndrank on average two to three times a month. He drank approximately two to three \nbeers on each occasion. After his graduation from college, Applicant entered the \nmilitary. His alcohol use was relatively light when he was on active duty. He drank on \naverage two to three beers in one sitting, or two to three mixed drinks in one sitting \nthree to five times a year. (Gov 2 at 1) \n \nApplicant increased his alcohol use after his father died in 1992. He consumed \nthree drinks in one sitting, three to five times a month.  Applicant began to drink heavily \nafter his mother died in March 1999. He started drinking a six pack of beer a week. His \nalcohol use elevated to 24 beers a week. He drank alone on weekends and in the \nevenings after work. In March 2000, Applicant progressed to 1.5 liters of rum and 24 \nbeers a week. He drank alcohol seven days and week and drank to intoxication four \ndays a week. (Tr at 46 - 47; Gov 2 at 1) \n \nIn November 2001, Applicant attempted to quit drinking alcohol. He did not \nconsume alcohol for three days. He started to hallucinate and heard voices. On \nNovember 29, 2001, Applicant went to a local hospital emergency room. He was treated \nfor acute alcohol withdrawal. He told the emergency room personnel that he had been \ndrinking a case of beer a night for the past two years. He suffered hallucinations and \ndelirium tremens when he was going through alcohol withdrawal. He was prescribed a \ndrug to help him with the withdrawal symptoms. He was also advised of various \ntreatment options related to his alcoholism. His family physician diagnosed him with \n\n \n3 \n \n \nalcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol dependency. (Tr at 47-48, 51-53; Gov 2 at 2; \nGov 4; Gov 5) \n \nFrom January 7, 2002, to April 8, 2002, Applicant attended outpatient alcohol \ncounseling at a local clinic. His counselor, a licensed clinical social worker, diagnosed \nhim as alcohol dependent. His discharge prognosis was good provided he followed the \nrecommendations of his continued care therapist. (Gov 2 at 2-3; Gov 6) In addition to \nhis outpatient counseling, Applicant attended one Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting \nper week. He attended weekly AA meetings until July 2002. He stopped attending AA \nbecause he felt he \u201cwas back in control of my life and could handle alcohol use on my \nown.\u201d  He never had a sponsor in AA. He admitted during the hearing that he was \nadvised by his alcohol counselors that he should not drink alcohol at all. (Tr at 48-54; \nGov 2 at 3)  \n \nIn 2005, Applicant started to drink alcohol again. He described his alcohol usage \nas light to moderate. He drank one to three glasses of wine with dinner about once a \nmonth. In the hot weather, he would drink one to three beers on average two to four \ntimes a week. In cooler weather, he drank two beers, two to three times a week. He did \nnot drink hard liquor and did not let his alcohol use affect his life. (Tr at 54, 57; Gov 2 at \n3; Gov 3 at 12)  \n \nIn answers to interrogatories, dated August 21, 2008, Applicant indicated that the \nlast time he drank alcohol was about 8-12 months ago. He drank a 12-pack of beer. He \nstated he no longer drinks alcohol because he is older and concerned about his health. \n(Gov 3 at 3-4) He was placed on blood pressure medication. He was advised not to \ndrink alcohol while taking this medication. Applicant\u2019s last use of alcohol was in \napproximately April 2008. (Tr at 55-60)    \n \nIn conjunction with his security clearance background investigation, Applicant \nwas assessed by a licensed clinical social worker (hereinafter referred to as counselor) \nabout the status of his alcohol use on September 16, 2008.  During the assessment, \nApplicant stated that his last use of alcohol was six months ago.  Based on the \ninformation provided by Applicant, the counselor concluded that he did not meet the \ncriteria for substance abuse treatment. The counselor\u2019s diagnosis was that Applicant \nwas alcohol dependent with physiological dependence sustained full remission. \nApplicant was advised that he could benefit from active participation in an Alcoholics \nAnonymous support group in order to assist him in maintaining his sobriety. (Gov 3 at 8-\n17) He does not currently attend AA. He is trying to find a group that he feels \ncomfortable with. (Tr at 58)    \n \nThe Facility Security Officer at the company where Applicant worked when he \nunderwent treatment for alcoholism testified during the hearing. She worked with \nApplicant for approximately five years. During the time Applicant worked for the \ncompany he never exercised questionable judgment. She never considered him \nunreliable or untrustworthy.  Applicant was dedicated to his position and had a good \nreputation with his manager, subordinates, and peers. Applicant was never involved in \n\n \n4 \n \n \nany security violations during the period she worked with him. (Tr at 25-32)  In a signed \nletter submitted after the hearing, she stated that Applicant does present a security risk \nto the US government. She is aware of his problems with alcohol but believes he has \nconquered that problem. She has never seen him intoxicated. She recommends him for \na security clearance. (AE D at 5)   \n \nA senior engineer who recently worked closely with Applicant on a project, \ndescribes him as \u201cprofessional,\u201d \u201cproactive, mission-oriented, and knowledgeable.\u201d (AE \nD at 3) Applicant\u2019s former department manager has known Applicant for 12 years. He \nhas worked with him for eight years. He states Applicant has always shown a high \ndegree of integrity and responsibility. Applicant is always timely and responsible to his \ncustomer\u2019s needs. The department manager states Applicant\u2019s good judgment and \nmature outlook ensured a logical and practical approach to his endeavors and he would \nbe an asset to any organization. (AE D at 4)  \n \nA senior logistics analyst has worked with Applicant for the past two years. They \nhave successfully worked together on many challenging and complicated issues and \nprojects.  Applicant has a natural acumen for team building. He highly recommends \nApplicant because he has the personal and technical wherewithal to plan, organize, \ndirect, control, and complete all actions required to master any project. (AE D at 6-7)   \n \nDuring his active duty service, Applicant was awarded the Army Commendation \nMedal with One Oak Leaf Cluster, the Overseas Service Ribbon and the Army Service \nRibbon. (AE B) He was received numerous certificates of appreciation and \ncommendations during his years working as a defense contractor. (AE C)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) &22(c) (habitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nperson is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. When he was \ndrinking heavily, Applicant drank approximately a case of beer each evening. He also \ndrank approximately 1.5 liters of hard liquor (rum) each week. His alcohol use was \nexcessive and impaired his judgment.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAC DC &22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence) \napplies. Applicant\u2019s family physician diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent when \nhe sought treatment in November 2001.  \n  \nAC DC &22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) \napplies. After Applicant was treated for acute alcohol withdrawal, he attended outpatient \ntreatment at a center involved in alcohol counseling. The counselor, a license clinical \nsocial worker, diagnosed him as alcohol dependent.  \n \nAC DC &22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence \nand completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) applies. Applicant completed \noutpatient alcohol treatment on April 8, 2002. He remained sober for approximately two \nyears but started drinking alcohol again because he thought he could handle it.  \nAlthough, Applicant describes his alcohol use as light to moderate, it raises a security \nconcern because Applicant decided to begin drinking alcohol after completion of his \ntreatment program and after being advised to abstain from alcohol.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. While serious concerns \nare raised pertaining to Applicant\u2019s decision to start drinking alcohol again, he stopped \ndrinking alcohol in April 2008.  He fully disclosed his alcohol use during his September \n2008 alcohol assessment and still received a favorable prognosis despite this \ndisclosure. His co-workers think highly of him. He has no alcohol-related issues at work \nor outside of work. There are no recent issues pertaining to his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.    \n \n \nAC MC & 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) applies.  Applicant acknowledges that he is an alcoholic.  He took steps \nto deal with his alcoholism in 2001. He was sober for several years after completing \ntreatment. Although, he started to drink alcohol in 2005 because he thought he could \nhandle it, he stopped drinking alcohol in April 2008 due to health issues. He is \nprescribed medication that cannot be mixed with alcohol. He does not intend to drink \nalcohol in the future.       \n \nFC MC &23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a \nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program) partially applies.  Although Applicant began to drink alcohol \nagain several years after he completed treatment for alcohol dependence and against \nthe advice of his counselors, he stopped drinking in April 2008.  He fully disclosed that \nhe had resumed drinking alcohol during his alcohol assessment in September 2008. \nDespite his disclosure, the counselor gave Applicant a diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence, in sustained full remission. I consider this to be a favorable prognosis.  \nHowever, Applicant does not attend AA meetings. The counselor who did the \nassessment recommended that he continue to attend AA meetings in order to assist \nhim with maintaining his sobriety.  Even though Applicant appeared to be serious about \nremaining abstinent at the hearing, FC MC \u00b6 23(d) is given less weight because \nApplicant does not attend AA meetings.  \n \nSecurity concerns were raised under alcohol consumption, Applicant met his \nburden to mitigate the concerns raised because he has not drank alcohol in over eight \nmonths, he received a favorable prognosis in a September 2008 alcohol assessment, \nand there is no evidence of any alcohol-related incidents involving Applicant. Guideline \nG is found for Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s past \nstruggles with alcohol. I considered that he voluntarily sought treatment in November \n2001. I considered that he has had no alcohol-related arrests or incidents at work. He \nstopped drinking alcohol in April 2008. He has been sober for over 8 months. He is on \nprescription medication that is not compatible with alcohol use. He does not intend to \ndrink alcohol in the future. His September 2008 alcohol assessment was favorable. The \nfavorable comments of Applicant\u2019s superiors and co-workers weigh heavily in his favor. \nWhile it is recommended that Applicant resume attendance at AA meetings, there is \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsubstantial evidence to conclude that his alcohol problem is currently under control. He \nis aware that future alcohol use could jeopardize his ability to maintain a security \nclearance. While Applicant\u2019s decision to resume alcohol use after completion of \noutpatient treatment raised security issues under alcohol consumption, he has mitigated \nthe concerns based on his honesty about his alcoholism, his favorable alcohol \nassessment in September 2008, his past eight months of sobriety, and the favorable \nrecommendations of his current and former coworkers. Guideline G, Alcohol \nConsumption, is found for Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 22, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 10, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 11, 2009. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on March 4, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n(AE) A through B. Department Counsel did not object and they were admitted. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 13, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.d and 1.i of the SOR and denied the remaining \nallegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior software consultant who has been employed by \na federal contractor since late 2007. Applicant served in the Air Force from 1979 to \n1990. She was discharged with an Honorable Discharge under General Conditions. She \nwent to two Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 15 hearings while in the Air \nForce the last one for writing two bad checks.1 Applicant has worked for different \nemployers since her discharge and has experienced two short periods of \nunemployment, one for two months and another for three months. Applicant is not \nmarried and is a college graduate with a degree in business management and \ncommunications.2  \n \n \nApplicant worked in the insurance industry from 1995 to 1999. Her income was \nlinked to commissions. The industry experienced changes and her income decreased. \nShe left this job and moved to the telecommunications industry from 1999 to 2000. In \n1999, Applicant filed for bankruptcy and had approximately $25,000 to $30,000 in debt \ndischarged.3 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a cell telephone bill ($606). Applicant stated \nthat in 2005 she requested her account be terminated because she was dissatisfied \nwith the service. She admitted she canceled the account prior to the end of the contract \nand there was a termination fee. She was not aware of the fee being waived. She has \nbeen aware of the bill since receiving the SOR and has not contacted the creditor to \nresolve it.4  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a medical bill ($41). Applicant stated she \ncontacted the creditor and they did not have an account listed for her. She stated she \nfiled a dispute with the credit bureau and it has been removed from her credit report. \n \n1 I have not considered Applicant\u2019s discharge or Article 15 hearings for disqualifying purposes, \nbut have considered it when analyzing the whole person and her history of financial problems. Applicant \nwas not completely candid when first asked about her discharge from the Air Force and the \ncircumstances of her Article 15 hearings. \n \n2 Tr. 19-29. \n \n3 Tr. 24, 29-31. \n \n4 Tr. 31-34. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nHowever, the debt remains on two credit bureau reports from 2008.5 Applicant did not \nprovide a copy of the credit report she was referring to, nor did she provide any \ndocumentation to substantiate her dispute.6  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is to a cable company ($339). Applicant \nacknowledges she did not return the cable box to the company when she moved two \nyears ago. She has the cable box in her storage unit in another state. She stated she \nwill return it when she accesses her storage unit. The debt is not paid.7 \n \n \nIn 2006 Applicant used a tax preparer service to prepare and file her 2005 \nincome taxes. It was determined that she was due a refund of $5,165. Applicant elected \nto receive a \u201crapid refund\u201d whereby the preparer gave Applicant the amount of the \nrefund immediately, less a fee, so she did not have to wait for the refund through the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). This \u201crapid refund\u201d is basically a loan until she receives \nthe refund from the IRS. Applicant took the \u201crapid refund\u201d and paid some bills and spent \nit on other items. When she received her refund from the IRS the amount was \napproximately $800. When questioned about the large difference, Applicant testified \nthat the IRS garnished part of her refund to pay for back taxes that were owed from \n2004. Applicant has not repaid the loan she received from the \u201crapid refund.\u201d She has \nknown of the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d since 2006. In answers to interrogatories \nfrom July 16, 2008, about this delinquent debt she stated: \u201cI am making arrangements \nto make payments on this account. These payments will start on 1 Aug 2008-$150 will \nbe paid monthly until it is paid or I have the ability to pay it off.\u201d8 Applicant never made \narrangements to pay it off and never made any monthly payments on this debt. She \nstated she was irresponsible.9 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she failed to file her 2003 income taxes on time. She \neventually filed them in 2006 and paid them along with the associated penalties and \ninterest. She stated she did not believe she had to file her taxes in 2003 because she \nhad a low income.10  \n \n \nApplicant stated she paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e (credit card/collection, \n$2,608) to the original creditor in 2001. She did not provide any documented proof of \npayment or that she formally disputed the account with the credit bureau. She did not \n \n5 GE 2 page 1; GE 3 page 8. \n \n6 Tr. 34-36. \n \n7 Tr. 36-37. \n \n8 GE 4. \n \n9 Tr. 37-43. \n \n10 Tr. 43-45. I will not consider this information for disqualifying purposes, but will consider it when \nanalyzing Applicant past financial problems and her total financial situation. I will also consider it when \nanalyzing the whole person.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ncontact the creditor or collection agency to verify the debt or attempt to resolve her \ndispute.11  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f (Auto repossession, $12,378) was for a car Applicant \nbought and later voluntarily had it repossessed. Applicant accepted and settled the debt \nfor approximately $3,100.12 \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g (personal loan, $1,036). She stated it \nwas paid in 2000. Applicant did not provide any documented proof of payment or proof \nshe contacted the creditor or credit bureau and formally disputed the debt.13  \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h (department store/collection, $885). \nShe stated she disputed the account with the creditor in the past and the creditor does \nnot have an account in her name. She also testified she did not contact the collection \nagency or the creditor since receiving the SOR to validate the debt or resolve the \nissue.14 \n \n \nI did not find Applicant credible or believable when testifying about paying some \nof her debts or that she contacted the creditors in the past. Applicant provided a \npersonal financial statement. She listed she has $938 expendable income each month \nafter paying her expenses. She maintains a $59 monthly account for a membership to a \nmassage business and a $35 monthly account for magazine subscriptions. She has \napproximately $500 in savings and has no other investments. Applicant failed to list \nadditional monthly expenses for a storage unit ($150); car insurance on a second car \nthat she loans to another person ($75); and dog grooming ($65). She stated she pays \nher current monthly expenses on time.15  \n \n \nApplicant has not had any financial counseling.16 \n \n \nApplicant provided her annual performance review from her employer. In the \nreview she provided self-assessment comments. She stated: \u201cI will be working to \nincrease my attention to deadlines and completing all required documents and actions \nin a timely manner, especially since this will greatly affect the other individuals that must \nprovide input to these documents and actions.\u201d Her supervisor recognizes Applicant as \n \n11 Tr. 46-49. \n \n12 Tr. 50-53; GE 4 at page 9; AE B. \n \n13 Tr. 54-58. \n \n14 Tr. 58-59. \n \n15 Tr. 60; GE 4 at page 3. \n \n16 Tr. 63-74. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \na leader, a manager, and a team player and recommended her for promotion. She is \nconsidered smart and talented.17 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n17 AE A. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19 \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that she has not paid. She was aware \nof the debts before receiving her SOR. Since receiving the SOR she has taken little if \nany action on most of the debts. She made promises to resolve some of the debts, but \nfailed to follow through. I find both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts\u201d); and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate \nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nApplicant has debts that are unpaid and unresolved and therefore current. \nDespite her promises to pay certain debts she failed to follow through on paying them. \nShe has been aware of the debts and has failed to contact the creditors she claimed \nshe paid to dispute and resolve the claims. I find (a) does not apply because some of \nher delinquent debts have not been resolved and cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Applicant had short periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment and these conditions were beyond her control. However, these \nconditions can not be viewed in a vacuum and it must be determined if Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been aware of the security \nconcerns regarding her delinquent debts and has not taken action to resolve them. In \ninstances where she claimed she paid the debt, she did not provide documented proof \nand in some cases she failed to contact the creditor to dispute the debt. I find (b) only \npartially applies. Applicant has not received financial counseling. Due to her failure to \naddress her outstanding debts and contact creditors I find there are no clear indications \nthat the problem is under control. Hence, I can not apply (c). Applicant has paid one \nlarge debt, however others remain with little or no effort made to resolve them. Applicant \ndisputed many debts claiming they were paid, but failed to document her disputes or \nprovide proof of payment. She terminated a contract and was aware of a termination \nfee, but never addressed or challenged the debt. She has in her possession a cable \nbox, but failed to return it or pay for it. She received a tax \u201crapid refund\u201d and never \nrepaid the money she owed because her refund was applied to back taxes. I find (d) \npartially applies because she resolved one large debt. I find (e) does not apply because \nApplicant failed to provide any substantiation that she paid or resolved the remaining \ndelinquent debts and they are in dispute.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a fine work record. \nHer company and supervisor think highly of her. Applicant also has a history of financial \nproblems. She had delinquent debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1999 and had a clean \nfinancial record. Unfortunately she again accumulated debts that are delinquent and \nunpaid. She claimed she paid some of her debts or disputed them, but provided no \ndocumented proof. She failed to contact creditors listed in the SOR to dispute some of \nher debts. She acknowledged owing some of the debts, but has not paid them. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On October\n21, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge mis-weighed the record\nevidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a network engineer employed by a Defense contractor.\nHe had several delinquent credit card debts.  Applicant also had judgements against him due to his\nfailure to pay fines, costs, and administrative surcharges resulting from several offenses over the\ncourse of twenty years.  These offenses included operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol,\ndriving under a suspended license, etc.  Additionally, and also as a consequence of his numerous\noffenses, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended.  The periods of suspension were as\nfollows: (1) October 1984 to April 1985; (2) November 1985 to February 2004; and (3) February\n2005 to February 2007.  \nIn completing his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant did not disclose several\nof his debts that had been delinquent more than 180 days.  In the Analysis portion of the decision,\nthe Judge concluded that, in light of the entire record, Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate.  \u201cA\ngood-faith effort to comply would require at a minimum that he disclose generally that he had fallen\nseriously past due on credit card balances within the past seven years and that he owed surcharges\nto state X that continued to mount because of his history of late payments.\u201d  Decision at 12.   \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider the extent to which he is paying down his\ndebts.  Applicant also contends that the Judge extended too much weight to evidence that he took\nan overseas trip though in debt, that he has acquired new debts in the form of loans for an advanced\ndegree, and that Applicant\u2019s security manager did not recall being advised of omissions on the SCA.2\nWe have examined these contentions in light of the record.  \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008). In this case, the Judge explicitly considered Applicant\u2019s repayment efforts, but she further\nexplained why these efforts were not sufficient to mitigate the Guideline F security concerns.  For\n\n3\nexample, she noted that Applicant has acquired new credit card debt, thereby undermining his claim\nof operating on a cash basis.  Regarding Applicant\u2019s other contentions, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009) (A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law).  Also, the Judge did not exceed her authority to draw reasonable\ninferences from the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05434 at 2 (App. Bd.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Joseph O\u2019Connell, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant committed several motor vehicle offenses between 1984 and 2004,\nincluding operating under the influence of alcohol (OUI) and driving while his operator\u2019s\nlicense was suspended. His failure to timely pay surcharges led to suspension of his\ndriving privileges for over 20 years, and accumulated debt of about $24,079.22 to the\ndivision of motor vehicles. As of April 2008, he had paid $11,071 of the debt but was\nbehind in his payments. He also owed about $8,314 in delinquent consumer credit debt\nthat he did not disclose on his security clearance application. Alcohol consumption\nconcerns are mitigated by the absence of any alcohol-related incident since he\ncompleted court-ordered counseling in 2005, but financial considerations and personal\nconduct concerns persist. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 10, 2008. On January 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Guideline G, and Guideline E that provided the\nOctober 21, 2009\n\n2\nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to\nan administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nOn February 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009, to decide whether it is clearly consistent\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Counsel for Applicant entered his\nappearance on April 27, 2009. On June 2, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for June 30,\n2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The government\u2019s case consisted of eight\nexhibits (Ex. 1-7, 9) and the testimony of a government investigator. Department\nCounsel had court records marked as Exhibit 8 but then withdrew the document.\nApplicant submitted 12 exhibits, which were entered without any objections, and he\ntestified on his behalf. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on July 9, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that as of July 22,\n2008, Applicant owed unpaid judgments of $1,100 (SOR 1.a) and $11,975 (SOR 1.b) to\na state division of motor vehicles, a $997 judgment from 1992 (SOR 1.d), and $10,398\nin delinquent credit card debt (SOR 1.c, 1.e-1.h). Under Guideline G, alcohol\nconsumption, Applicant was alleged to have been arrested on drunk driving charges in\nAugust 1984 (SOR 2.a), November 1988 (SOR 2.b), and December 2004 (convicted of\nrefusal to consent to breathalyser) (SOR 2.d), and been cited in March 1996 for drinking\non a facility (SOR 2.c). Guideline E, personal conduct, was alleged because Applicant\u2019s\nmotor vehicle license had been suspended from October 1984 to April 1985, November\n1985 to February 2004, and February 2005 to February 2007, because of his motor\nvehicle violations (SOR 3.a), and because he had  been convicted of a January 2004\nunlicensed driver offense (SOR 3.b). DOHA also alleged under Guideline E that\nApplicant had falsified his January 2008 e-QIP by failing to disclose some of his\ndelinquent debts (SOR 3.c) and the January 2004 unlicensed driver offense (SOR 3.d). \nApplicant admitted that he had owed the delinquent debts in SOR 1.a-1.e and\n1.h. He had made payments arrangements on the debts in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e, and\nhad proposed a repayment plan on the judgment in SOR 1.d. He had paid the credit\ncard debts in SOR 1.c and 1.h. Applicant averred that the debt in SOR 1.g was a\nduplicate of that in SOR 1.e, and he also denied SOR 1.f because it had been resolved.\nApplicant admitted the allegations SOR 2.a-2.d under Guideline G and SOR 3.a and 3.b\nunder Guideline E. He denied the alleged falsifications (SOR 3.c and 3.d) of his e-QIP.\nAfter considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nfact.\n\nDOHA alleged, and Applicant admitted, that his operator\u2019s license was suspended from November\n1\n1985 to February 2004, and again from February 2005 to February 2007, as a result of a number of traffic\nviolations he committed, including driving while license suspended/revoked, speeding, improper turn, refusal\nto submit to chemical test, failure to comply with countermeasures program, nonpayment of insurance\nsurcharge, failure to appear, operating under the influence, and failure to comply with court install order.\nApplicant testified that his license was suspended automatically when he missed one installment payment of\nstate X motor vehicle surcharges, including $3,000 assessments for each drunk driving offense (Tr. 100). It\nis unclear why his license was suspended in November 1985. He admitted at his hearing that he had\nrepeatedly driven a vehicle while his license was suspended between November 1985 and February 2004 (Tr.\n187).\nAvailable information indicates that his license was not restored until February 2004.\n2\n3\nApplicant is a 45-year-old network engineer, who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since January 2008. His duty station is on a military installation, and\nhe requires a secret clearance for his work securing wireless networks for the military\n(Tr. 67-68).\nApplicant was arrested for OUI in his home state (state X) in August 1984, when\nhe was 20 years old. He pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to pay fines and court costs\nof $365. Applicant was assessed a separate $3,000 surcharge by the state in addition\nto the court fine and costs (Tr. 185), and his driver\u2019s license was suspended by state X\nfor six months until April 1985.\nApplicant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was suspended by state X in November 1985 as a\nresult of additional traffic violations or failure to pay the surcharge imposed for his first\nOUI.  Over the next 18 years,  he repeatedly drove while his license was suspended\n1\n2\n(Tr. 187), including in November 1988, when he committed his second OUI offense. He\npleaded guilty to the OUI charge in March 1989 and was sentenced to fines and costs\ntotaling $615. The state again assessed a $3,000 surcharge that he did not pay (Tr.\n185). On November 15, 1994, state X was awarded a $11,975 judgment against\nApplicant for unpaid fines and surcharges (Ex. 7).\nOn April 28, 1992, the lender of a key machine for his family\u2019s business obtained\na judgment of $997 against Applicant (Ex. 7, Tr. 137). Applicant made no effort to repay\nthe debt until after it became an issue for his clearance.\nIn March 1996, Applicant was caught with an open container of beer on a train\n(Tr. 97). He was convicted in May 1996 of a public drinking charge (drinking on a\nfacility) and fined $50. From May 1996 until 2001, Applicant worked as a night manager\nat a bar in state X (Ex. 1). Toward the end of that employment, he began to rely on\nconsumer credit to pay expenses. Between 1999 and 2001, he opened the credit card\naccounts in SOR 1.c, 1.e (duplicate debt in 1.g), 1.f, and 1.h.\n\nApplicant indicated on his e-QIP that he started his education in state Y in November 2001 (Ex. 1).\n3\nHowever, his February 2008 credit report (Ex. 4) shows that he took out his first student loans from state Y\nin July 2000 for $2,625 and $2,667. He also took out a $2,200 loan through the university in December 2000.\nApplicant testified that he worked in some internship positions (Tr. 90). Among employments listed\n4\non his e-QIP are an information systems networking specialist position with a medical imaging company from\nMarch 2005 to June 2005,  a compliance manager consultant position from June 2005 to January 2006, and\na wireless network sales/installation technician position from June 2005 to October 2007 (Ex. 1). The record\nbefore me for review contains no specifics about his earned income for these positions.\n4\nIn about 2000 or 2001, Applicant moved to his current state of residence (state\nY) and began undergraduate studies in information sciences networking (Tr. 66).3\nApplicant worked part-time as a bartender while in college, and his income was not\nsufficient to meet all his expenses (Ex. 9). In January 2001, he stopped paying on his\ncredit card account in SOR 1.h. He did not pay on the credit card debts in SOR 1.c, 1.e,\nand 1.f after the May/June 2001 time frame (Ex. 5). In 2003, he began receiving debt\ncollection notices that he ignored (Ex. 9).\nIn January 2004, Applicant was charged with being an unlicensed driver in state\nX. He was found guilty of the charge in March 2004 and ordered to pay fines and costs\nof $386. He paid the fines the next day (Answer).\nIn June 2004, Applicant earned his Bachelor of Science degree (Ex. 1). He\nelected to continue his education toward a Master of Business Administration, and he\nfinanced his master\u2019s degree with additional student loans (Exs. 4, 5). He was awarded\nhis M.B.A. in about February 2006 (Ex. 1). During graduate school, he held some\npositions in the information services sector,  worked seasonal employment for the\n4\npostal service in 2004 and 2005, and was a banquet bartender for a local hotel (Ex. 1,\nTr. 90). He testified that he was in and out of different jobs while in school and could not\nkeep up with his obligations (Tr. 89), but he took a pleasure trip to Ireland in August\n2004 (Ex. 1).\nOn December 23, 2004, Applicant pulled off the road onto an off-ramp while\ndriving from state Y to state X for the holidays, and he fell asleep. Applicant testified he\nwas not intoxicated but he was too tired to drive. He denied he had consumed any\nalcohol that evening to a state trooper who had come upon his vehicle, but also testified\nthat he submitted to four breathalyser tests. Applicant was charged with OUI, failure to\npossess a license, and refusal to take a breathalyser because he had not performed the\ntests correctly (Tr. 168-69). Because of the passage of time since his last OUI, it was\nconsidered a second rather than third drunk driving offense by state X (Tr. 172-73). On\nFebruary 14, 2005, he pleaded guilty to the refusal charge on the advice of his attorney.\nHe was found not guilty of the remaining charges. He was fined $739, ordered to attend\nan alcohol awareness program, and his license was suspended for 24 months (Answer,\nTr. 170-71). He was also assessed another $3,000 surcharge by state X (Tr. 185). In\nAugust 2005, the division of motor vehicles in state X obtained a $1,100 judgment\nagainst Applicant (Ex. 7), and the state issued a $1,100 tax lien against him (Ex. 5) for\nhis failure to pay fines and surcharges. In July 2006, state X issued a tax lien of $1,100\nagainst Applicant for his failure to pay fines and surcharges (Exs. 4, 5).\n\nApplicant\u2019s February 7, 2008 credit report (Ex. 5) lists a $3,081 debt balance placed by the original\n5\nlender for collection as of March 2003 (SOR 1.g). The assignee in SOR 1.e is collecting for the lender in SOR\n1.g, so they are likely the same debt.\n5\nApplicant attended twelve sessions of court-ordered counseling from July 11,\n2005, to October 13, 2005. He completed the program free of substance abuse and, at\ndischarge on October 14, 2005, he was given a diagnosis of alcohol abuse in partial\nremission (Ex. H).\nIn August 2007, Applicant consolidated most of his student loan accounts into\ntwo separate loans of $37,909 and $37,176, which were deferred. As of late 2007,\nApplicant owed unpaid collection balances of $973 on SOR 1.c, $4,561 on SOR 1.e\n(updated balance of 1.g ), and $1,556 on SOR 1.f. His account with the lender in SOR\n5\n1.h was past due 180 days in the amount of $226 (Ex. 5).\nIn January 2008, Applicant began working for his current employer at an annual\nsalary of $60,000 (Tr. 145). Applicant was asked to apply for a security clearance, and\nhe completed an electronically submitted e-QIP at home on January 10, 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n70). In response to whether he had ever been charged with any offense related to\nalcohol or drugs, he listed only the December 2004 refusal to submit to a breathalyser.\nHe did not disclose his January 2004 unlicensed driver conviction in response to\nquestion 23.f, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or\nconvicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out\ntraffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.).\u201d He\ntestified credibly, albeit mistakenly, that he recalled the fine as less than $150 and\nneither alcohol nor drugs was involved. Concerning financial delinquencies, Applicant\nresponded \u201cYes\u201d to question 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d but he disclosed only a $213.29 cellular phone debt that he\nsatisfied in January 2008. He knew that he had old delinquent credit card debts (Tr.\n113) and did not disclose them in response to question 28.a or 28.b (\u201cAre you currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He responded \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28.b, 27.c\n(\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien laced against your property for failing to pay\ntaxes or other debts?\u201d) and 27.d (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments\nagainst you that had not been paid?\u201d), even though he owed several credit card debts in\ncollection and state X had acquired tax liens and judgments against him for failure to\npay motor vehicle surcharges. Applicant claims it was because he did not have the\ninformation about the accounts before him at the time (\u201cThere were so, I knew there\nwere so many, I didn\u2019t have the documentation in front of me and, as I said, I should\nhave pulled the credit report and entered that information first.\u201d Tr.116).\nAccording to Applicant, shortly after he submitted his e-QIP, he obtained his\ncredit report that confirmed the outstanding delinquencies (\u201cI had the credit report from\nthe credit reporting agency stating all this open information that was on there.\u201d). It\nprompted him to contact his security manager the day after he submitted the e-QIP, and\nhe informed her that he had omitted some adverse credit information (Tr. 72, 116-17).\nHis security manager does not recollect that conversation with him (Tr. 121).\n\nApplicant owed outstanding  debt to a local hospital that was not alleged in the SOR. On July 8, 2008,\n6\nhe paid $1,037.71 to settle his debt to a local hospital (Ex. 2).\nRecent credit reports (Exs. 2, 3) confirm that Applicant refinanced his student loan debt in April 2008\n7\nthrough two loans of $49,982 and $38,253, to be repaid at $258 and $197 per month.\n6\nAlerted to the delinquent credit card debts through a check of Applicant\u2019s credit\non February 7, 2008 (Ex. 5), or February 27, 2008 (Ex. 4), or both, a government\ninvestigator interviewed Applicant on February 25, 2008, about his debts. Applicant\ndisclosed at the beginning of the interview that he had informed his security officer\nabout his adverse credit information and that he had been directed to hold onto the\ninformation until he was interviewed. (Tr. 33). Applicant explained that sometime\nbetween 2001 and 2002, he was unable to make the minimum payments due on his\ncredit cards. He indicated that he had not used any credit cards or made any attempts\nto pay any of his overdue balances since about 2001 or 2002. Starting in 2003, he was\nnotified that accounts were in collection but he did not respond to those notices.\nApplicant also told the agent that he obtained a copy of his credit report in January 2008\nto determine the status of his accounts and that most of his accounts were reported as\ncharged off. Applicant interpreted it to mean that he was no longer responsible for\nrepaying the debt (Ex. 9, Tr. 34). The agent then went through the debts listed on the\ncredit report with Applicant (Tr. 37).  Applicant did not dispute the debts in SOR 1.c, 1.e,\n1,f and 1.h. He indicated he did not intend to repay them since they had been charged\noff and would be removed from his credit record. He explained that the debts had been\nomitted from his e-QIP \u201cby mistake.\u201d (Ex. 9).\nAs of March 21, 2008, Applicant had paid $11,071 toward his $24,079.22 in total\njudgment debt that had been awarded state X for unpaid motor vehicle surcharges and\nfines, but he was behind in his installment payments. On March 21, 2008, state X\nnotified Applicant that his driving privileges would be indefinitely suspended on May 11,\n2008, if he failed to pay $1,118 in full by April 5, 2008 (Ex. B). On or before July 16,\n2008, Applicant promised to pay $326.45 to restore from default his surcharge account\n(Ex. 2).  As of November 28, 2008, Applicant was making $100 monthly installment\n6\npayments toward an outstanding judgment balance of $12,430.54. With subsequent\ninstallment payments, he had reduced the debt to $11,998.78 as of June 5, 2009 (Ex.\nB). But his operating privileges had not been restored in state X (Tr. 189). He denies\noperating a vehicle within state X without a valid license after his arrest in December\n2004 (Tr. 191).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial\nstatement dated July 21, 2008. He calculated a net monthly remainder of $929.15,\nwhich included $625 in anticipated monthly income from seasonal employment with a\nlocal NFL franchise that he did not always earn (Tr. 157). Applicant was making\npayments of $225 per month on a VISA credit card account. He indicated he was\npaying $455.35 per month toward his consolidated student loan balance of $88,794.877\nand $40 toward $2,637.40 in an additional student loan debt owed his former college\n(Ex. 2).\n\n7\nOn or before September 30, 2008, Applicant settled the debt in SOR 1.f (Ex. A).\nAs of October 2008, Applicant was current in his consolidated student loans, which had\nbalances of $47,659 and $36,475, and on his loan debt with his former college, which\nhad a balance of about $900 (Tr. 155). He was current on an open  credit card account,\nwhich had a balance of $11,271 (Ex. 3). On February 10, 2009, he settled the debt in\nSOR 1.c (Ex. L), and he paid $150 to settle the debt in SOR 1.h (Ex. F). On March 4,\n2009, he settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e (duplicate in 1.g) with a payment of $3,800 (Ex.\nE, Tr. 141). The money came from his income tax refund for 2008 (Tr. 159). On or\nbefore June 8, 2009, Applicant paid $500 in compromise settlement of the judgment\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Ex. D).\nAs of late June 2009, Applicant\u2019s annual salary from his work with the defense\ncontractor was about $61,000 (Tr. 145). He had made no payments on his student\nloans in about one year (Tr. 155). They were in deferment since he had returned to\nschool pursuing a degree in systems engineering. He was paying for his studies from\nhis income (Tr. 153-54).\nApplicant testified initially on direct examination that he has \u201cminimized his\nlifestyle,\u201d and operates on \u201cbasically a cash basis\u201d (Tr. 89). As of June 2009, Applicant\nwas paying $300 per month on his open credit card account, which had a current\nbalance of $13,000 (Ex. 6). The debt balance had been $10,724 in July 2008 (Ex. 2).\nSome of the debt was incurred for car repairs (Tr. 160-63). Applicant currently drinks on\na social basis, depending on the circumstances. He does not want a recurrence of his\n\u201cpast alcohol indiscretions\u201d and does not drive after drinking (Tr. 192).\nApplicant has performed in an outstanding manner as a key member of an\nengineering support team upgrading a military wireless LAN. He has the support of the\nmilitary branch chief (Ex. I) and supervisory personnel who work for the defense\ncontractor and evaluate his performance (Exs. J, K).  \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n8\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant incurred $24,079.22 in judgment debt because of his failure to pay\nmotor vehicle surcharges. Another creditor obtained a $997 judgment against him in\nApril 1992 that went unpaid until June 2009. Applicant stopped paying on some\nconsumer credit card obligations in about 2001 and delinquent balances totaling over\n$8,000 were placed for collection. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d apply.\n\n9\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be\napplied in mitigation. Applicant\u2019s debt to state X is due to his poor judgment in violating\nthe state\u2019s laws against OUI and operating after his license was suspended, and in\nfailing to timely pay surcharges imposed for his offenses. He was behind in his\ninstallment payments on the surcharges as recently as July 2008, and has paid only half\nof the total debt despite the passage of more than four years since his last offense.\nMoreover, he ignored collection notices on consumer credit card debts until it became\nclear to him that his failure to resolve them could cost him his security clearance. He\napparently took a pleasure trip overseas in 2004 while those delinquencies went unpaid.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply. The motor vehicle\nsurcharges were incurred because of his own irresponsibility. His reliance on consumer\ncredit to pay expenses while he was pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree (\u201cI got behind and I\nhad to make almost a Sophie\u2019s Choice of whether to pay the rent, keep the lights on.\u201d\nTr. 89), was likewise within his control. To the extent that insufficient income contributed\nto his financial problems, it does not extenuate his failure to take prompt action to repay\nhis consumer credit delinquencies once he began working for the defense contractor at\nan annual salary of $60,000.\nAs of February 2008, Applicant did not intend to repay those credit card debts\nwhich had been charged off. He has an M.B.A. degree and cannot credibly claim a good\nfaith belief that he did not have to repay those debts that were knowingly incurred and\ncharged off, or placed for collection, or both, due to nonpayment. Some accounts were\nstill reported as being in open collection status as of July 2008 (Ex. 2).\n \nApplicant made no effort to resolve his consumer credit card delinquencies, or\nthe judgment debt in SOR 1.h, until the fall of 2008, when he settled the debt in SOR\n1.f. Between February 2009 and June 2009, he settled the remaining credit card debts\nand the judgment in SOR 1.h. But it is difficult to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d\nbecause of the recency of these payments and his history of missed payments to state\nX on the judgments for unpaid surcharges.\nApplicant still owes about $11,998.78 to state X for the motor vehicle surcharges.\nWhile he was making his monthly installment payment of $100 as of June 2009, his\nrecord of missed payments, including in March 2008 and July 2008, when he was\nearning about $60,000 a year, continues to cast doubt on his financial judgment. With\ninterest continuing to accrue on the balance, Applicant had reduced the debt by only\n$431.76 since November 2008. Applicant chooses to pay for additional schooling when\nhe has yet to fulfill his obligation to state X. He is also paying about $300 a month on a\ncredit card debt balance of $13,000. While this account is not delinquent, his balance is\nabout $2,300 higher than it was in July 2008. It undermines his testimony somewhat\n\n10\nthat he has minimized his lifestyle and is operating basically on a cash basis (Tr. 89).\nAlthough his student loans are currently in forbearance, he will have to resume\nrepayment of some $88,235 in debt at some point. He has shown a preference to\npaying on his student loans over his motor vehicle surcharges in the past. Under the\nfacts presented, it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s drunk driving offenses from 1984 and 1988, and his\ncitation for a public drinking offense in 1996, implicate AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d While\nhe was charged with OUI in December 2004, and his refusal to consent to a\nbreathalyser was considered by state X to be an alcohol offense, the available evidence\ndoes not prove he was under the influence.\nHe was ordered by the court as a result of the December 2004 incident to\ncomplete an alcohol awareness program, where he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse.\nThe hearing record contains a one page, unsigned discharge summary that contains\nnothing about the qualifications of the clinician who rendered the diagnosis. So despite\nthe diagnosis, neither AG 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional\n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence,\u201d nor AG 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram,\u201d are implicated.\nIn mitigation, there has been no recurrence of any abusive drinking in over four\nyears. While the evidence does not prove that Applicant was under the influence of\nalcohol when he was arrested in December 2004, it is difficult to believe that he did not\nengage in abusive drinking at some point after the 1988 offense, given the diagnosis of\nalcohol abuse in 2005. On his discharge summary, it was noted that Applicant already\nbeen in partial remission when he entered treatment in July 2005. There is no evidence\nof any recent alcohol abuse, and Applicant intends to avoid his \u201cpast alcohol\nindiscretions.\u201d Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or\nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser),\u201d apply.\n\n11\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, \u00b6 15 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was suspended by state X from October 1984 to\nApril 1985 following his first OUI. When he failed to pay motor vehicle surcharges, it was\nsuspended again in November 1985. DOHA alleged, and Applicant admitted, that his\noperator\u2019s license was not restored before February 2004 due to numerous motor\nvehicle violations, including driving while license suspended/revoked, speeding,\nimproper turn, failure to comply with countermeasures program, refusal to submit to\nchemical test, non-payment of insurance surcharges, OUI, failure to appear, and failure\nto comply with court install order. He was caught driving without a license in January\n2004, but that was not the only occasion on which he operated a vehicle while his\nlicense was suspended over those 18 plus years. His serious disregard of state X\u2019s\nmotor vehicle laws raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3)\na pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d\nIn addition to the security concerns raised by his pattern of rule violations,\nApplicant has demonstrated behavior implicating AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d As of Applicant\u2019s\ncompletion of his January 2008 e-QIP, he was delinquent more than 180 days on the\ncredit card debts in the SOR, and had outstanding judgments against him. Yet he listed\nonly one cellular phone debt that he had satisfied. He likely knew that state X had been\nawarded judgments against him, including as recently as 2007. But even if he was\nunaware of the judgments, he knew that he had a history of late payments on the\nsurcharges resulting in his license being suspended again in 2005 until at least\n\nApplicant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was ordered suspended for 24 months for the December 2004 refusal\n8\nto submit to a breathalyser offense. It is unclear when, or if, it was restored after February 2007. His driving\nprivileges to operate within state X were suspended as of June 2009 (Tr. 189).\n12\nFebruary 2007.  He admitted that he was aware of old credit card debt which he claims\n8\nhe assumed had been charged off. His omissions were knowing and willful, and not\nextenuated by the fact that he may have been unaware of the account numbers or\nbalances. A good-faith effort to comply would require at a minimum that he disclose\ngenerally that he had fallen seriously past due on credit card balances within the past\nseven years, and that he owed surcharges to state X that continued to mount because\nof his history of late payments.\nDOHA\u2019s case for deliberate falsification or omission was not established with\nrespect to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his January 2004 unlicensed driver offense,\nhowever. Applicant was required to list the offense in response to question 23.f on the\ne-QIP concerning any arrests, charges, or convictions in the last seven years not\notherwise listed, unless it was not alcohol or drug related and involved a traffic fine of\nless than $150. Applicant denies that the incident was alcohol or drug related, and there\nis no evidence to show otherwise. The government alleged, and Applicant admitted, that\nhe was ordered to pay \u201cfines/court costs of $386.\u201d It is unclear how much of that amount\nrepresents fines as opposed to costs. Assuming a fine of $150 or more, Applicant\ntestified credibly that he recollected the fine to be less than $150 (Tr. 102). In view of his\ndisclosure of his more recent December 2004 offense, I accept his denial of any\nintentional concealment concerning his arrest record.\nThe personal conduct concerns raised by his years of demonstrated disregard of\nstate X\u2019s motor vehicle laws are not fully mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so\nminor, or so much times has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant denies that he\nhas operated a motor vehicle in state X without a valid license since his arrest in\nDecember 2004 (Tr. 191), but reform is incomplete without a track record of compliance\nwith the sanctions imposed. He was in default of his surcharge payments in March 2008\nand again in July 2008. Since November 2008, he had reduced his obligation by only\n$431.76. A lengthier track record of timely installment payments is warranted before I\ncan conclude that the personal conduct concerns are fully mitigated.\nConcerning potential mitigation of his concealment of known delinquent debts,\nApplicant submits that he notified his security manager of his omission of debt\ninformation. His security manager apparently has no recollection of any such\nconversation with him. However, the government investigator interviewed Applicant on\nFebruary 25, 2008, testified that Applicant started the interview by disclosing\n\u201cinformation about the financial situation that we had developed,\u201d including that he had\ninformed his security officer of the information and was directed to hold onto it until he\nwas interviewed (Tr. 33). As the investigator\u2019s report (Ex. 9) shows, Applicant also\nadmitted early on that he had stopped making payments on his credit cards between\n2001 and 2002, and that he did not respond to collection notices. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe\n\n13\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d applies. But reform is incomplete\nwithout meaningful acknowledgment of his behavior, and in this regard Applicant falls\nshort. Applicant testified that it was only in hindsight, after he obtained his credit report,\nthat he realized he made a \u201cmistake\u201d and should have disclosed his delinquencies on\nhis e-QIP (Tr. 117-18). He subsequently acknowledged that he knew he had old debts\nwhen he completed the e-QIP (Tr. 119), but he attributed his omission of debt\ninformation to not having the account information available. Applicant later\nacknowledged that he had known that he owed an outstanding balance to state X when\nhe filled out his e-QIP, but when asked why he did not disclose it, he responded, \u201cRight,\nI didn\u2019t put that in that, it\u2019s just brought that up now.\u201d After it was pointed out that\n$24,079 in surcharge debt would tend to suggest a history of delinquency and\naccumulation of interest due to nonpayment, Applicant acknowledged that the debt\nshould have been reported on his e-QIP based on the information he knew at the time\n(Tr. 136). His denials of any intent to conceal are not credible, and they undermine his\ncase in reform. AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d does not apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Applicant is\ncredited with settling his consumer credit card delinquencies, but the concerns in this\ncase are not fully mitigated by resolution of those debts. As recently as July 2008, he\nhad to pay a restoration fee to resume installment payments on his delinquent\njudgments to state X. Applicant has not provided a credible excuse for his recent failure\nto fully comply with his repayment obligation.\n\n14\nApplicant has shown good judgment in avoiding a recurrence of the drunk driving\nand operating after suspension behaviors. He has earned two college degrees, and\ncommenced a promising career in information services network technology. His work\nperformance during his first year on the job was valued by his supervisors and the\nmilitary customer. But Applicant put his personal interest ahead of his obligation of\ncandor when he did not disclose the surcharges or consumer credit card delinquencies\non his January 2008 e-QIP, and he continues to demonstrate a tendency to act in self-\ninterest. Based on his living expenses and the fact that he is not paying on his deferred\nstudent loans, Applicant should be able to afford more than $100 each month toward\nthe surcharge debt. Concerns persist about his judgment in part because of his failure\nto make repaying his surcharge debt a priority.\nApplicant\u2019s efforts in reform of the financial considerations and personal conduct\nconcerns are recent in time and must be considered in light of his many years of\nexhibited poor judgment involving several different aspects of his life (repeated drunk\ndriving and operating after license suspended, disregard of legitimate financial\nobligations for some seven years, and lack of candor on his January 2008 e-QIP about\nhis financial situation). I am unable to conclude at this time that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n           Paragraph 3, Paragraph E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n15\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

She failed to mitigate the \nforeign preference security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on May 9, 2007 \n(Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)) (GE 1). On July 14, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign \n \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended, \nmodified, and revised (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nNovember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).2 The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nher, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on August 8, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 26, \n2008. DOHA issued the notice of hearing on September 8, 2008. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on October 2, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 21). Applicant testified on her own \nbehalf, and presented exhibits (AE) 1 through 11, which were admitted without objection \n(Tr. 32). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 10, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nOn October 23, 2008, I called a post-hearing telephone conference call. Present \nduring the telephonic conference were Applicant and Department Counsel. The \npurposes of the conference call were: (1) Make Applicant aware of the security \nconcerns raised by her possession of a French identification card; (2) Ascertain \nApplicant\u2019s intentions with respect to her French identification card. Applicant promised \nto never use her French identification card to travel again. During the conference call, \nshe stated she was not willing to surrender her French identification card because that \nwould be equivalent to surrendering her French citizenship.  \n \n \nOn October 27, 2008, I issued an Order summarizing my recollection of the \nconference call. Department Counsel and Applicant were served with a copy of the \nOrder and allowed five days, from the date of the order, to submit comments. The Order \nand the parties\u2019 comments are attached to the record as Appellate Exhibit 1 (Order), \nAppellate Exhibit 2 (Department Counsel\u2019s comments, received October 30, 2008); \nAppellate Exhibit 3 (1st Applicant\u2019s comment - a one-page document faxed to me on \nNovember 1, 2008, dated October 30, 2008); and Appellate Exhibit 4 (Applicant\u2019s 2nd \ncomment \u2013 a one-page document, dated October 31, 2008, faxed to me on November \n3, 2008). All submissions were considered in my decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. She explained her \nactions were motivated by practical considerations and denied her actions \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, modified and revised. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndemonstrated any preference for France over the United States. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, \nI make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 22-year-old research analyst working for a defense contractor. She \nwas born in France to a U.S. born father and a French mother. She is a citizen of both \nthe United States and France. She grew up and was educated in France. While in \nFrance, she enjoyed all the privileges and rights of a French citizen. She has never \nbeen married and has no children. She attended an international high school in France \nto cultivate and nurture her American identity (Tr. 37). After high school, she was \nqualified to attend one of France\u2019s most prestigious universities free of charge. Instead, \nshe chose to attend a prestigious U.S. university at her own expense. \n \nApplicant elected to attend a U.S. university because of her attachment to the \nUnited States, and her belief in the United States\u2019 strength, values, and its education \nsystem (Tr. 38). In August 2008, she received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in International \nRelations (Tr. 6, 80). While studying in the United States from August 2004 to August \n2008, Applicant travelled to France every summer and fall vacations to visit her parents, \nrelatives, and friends. During the 2005 summer vacation, she worked in France for a \nFrench gourmet food company. In the summer of 2006, she worked for what was then \nthe French branch of a U.S. company (Tr. 39, AE 4). During the summer of 2007, she \nworked for a government contractor who detailed her to work for a U.S. government \nagency (AE 5).  \n \nFrom January to May 2008, she worked conducting sensitive research for a \ngovernment contractor. Her employer considered Applicant a proficient and reliable \nemployee who could be trusted with important projects. She never misused her access \nto sensitive information (AE 7). After college, Applicant was hired as a full-time \nemployee by a U.S. government contractor. She is considered a trusted and valuable \nemployee because of her job performance and her knowledge and familiarity with \nseveral foreign languages and cultures (Tr. 41). \n \nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandmother was raised in the United States and spoke \nEnglish to Applicant\u2019s mother as a child. She still communicates with Applicant in \nEnglish. Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of France. She lived three years in \nthe United States as a legal resident alien. In 1976, she married Applicant\u2019s father in the \nUnited States (Tr. 43). Applicant\u2019s mother is a professor at a French institution. \nApplicant\u2019s mother maintains strong ties with her extended family members in the \nUnited States. While growing up in France, Applicant frequently travelled to the United \nStates, to visit her parent\u2019s family members living in the United States (Tr. 85). \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in the United States. He has lived in France for over \n20 years and works as a professor at both a prestigious French institute and a school of \nbusiness (Tr. 44, 68). He never applied for French citizenship, cannot vote in French \nelections, and votes in U.S. elections. Since her arrival to the United States in August \n2004, Applicant has maintained frequent contact with her parents. Her parents call her \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntwice a week and they exchange e-mails two to three times a week (Tr. 64). Applicant \nhas two uncles, two aunts, a grandmother, numerous extended family members, and \nhigh school friends who are residents and citizens of France. She has infrequent \ncontact when them, visiting them when she travels to France (Tr. 62-63, 87). She last \ntraveled to France to visit her parents in March and June 2008 (Tr. 76).  \n \nAs of the day of the hearing, Applicant had a French bank account with an \napproximate value of $1,200 (Tr. 41). Her father opened the bank account for her when \nshe was a minor (Tr. 62, 72). She continues to use the bank account for practical \nreasons, i.e., to access money when she is in France while avoiding paying bank fees. \nShe funded the account with money given to her by her parents and grandparents. She \nintends to close the bank account when it runs out of money (Tr. 72). \n \nIn December 2006, at age 20, Applicant applied for her first French passport (Tr. \n51-55). Prior to December 2006, she only possessed and used her U.S. passport. She \nexplained she applied for the French passport for practical reasons, and not because \nshe has a preference for France over the United States (Tr. 35). As part of her U.S. \nuniversity\u2019s curriculum, she participated in a student exchange program with another \nforeign country. While preparing for the trip, she realized her U.S. passport would expire \nwhile she was abroad. Knowing she would have to surrender her U.S. passport to have \nit renewed, and that it would take approximately one month for her to receive the new \nU.S. passport, Applicant applied for a French passport. She received her French \npassport in March 2007. She used her French passport for a period of approximately 18 \nmonths. During that time, she used her French passport to travel to Israel, Jordan, and \nto travel in and out of France from other European countries. On June 23, 2008, \nApplicant surrendered her French passport to her company\u2019s security officer because of \nthe security clearance concerns it raised (AE 2). \n \nBetween August 2004 and the day of her hearing, Applicant used the French \nhealth care system because it was less expensive than the American health care \nsystem. She used the French health care system (her family doctors) while visiting her \nparents in France during her fall and summer vacations (Tr. 34, 60). The last time she \nused the French health care system was June 2008 (Tr. 74).  \n \nApplicant voted in the 2007 French presidential elections and in the 2008 French \nlocal elections (Tr. 56). She voted in French elections for several reasons: her parents \nlive in France and they are affected by French government\u2019s policies; she believes that \nthe political orientation and foreign policy agenda of a French president carries \nrepercussions on world politics; and she considers important to her what happens in \nFrance (Tr. 65, GE 3 at item 14). To register and to vote in France, and to use the \nFrench health care system, Applicant had to establish her French citizenship by \npresenting her French identification card.  \n \nThe French identification card was issued to Applicant by the French government \nas proof of her French citizenship. As of the hearing day, Applicant was in possession of \na valid French identification card (Tr. 56). She has used her French identification card to \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \ntravel in and out of France, as well as to travel in and out of other European countries \n(Tr. 57-59). At her hearing, Applicant testified she intended to continue using her French \nidentification card in her future trips to visit her family in France (Tr. 59).  \n \nOn October 23, 2008, I called a post-hearing telephone conference call.3 Present \nduring the telephonic conference were Applicant and Department Counsel. The \npurposes of the conference call were to make Applicant aware of the security concerns \nraised by her possession of a French identification card, and to ascertain her intentions \nwith respect to her French identification card. During the conference call, Applicant \npromised to never use her French identification card as a travel document again. She \nindicated she was not willing to surrender her French identification card because that \nwould be equivalent to surrendering her French citizenship.4 At the time, she did not \nconsider it to be practical to surrender her French identification card, because she will \nneed to use it in her future travels to France to visit her parents (Tr. 59).5  \n \nFrance is one of the United States\u2019 oldest allies and is one of the world\u2019s premier \ndemocracies. France and the United States share common values and have parallel \npolicies on most political, economic, and security issues.6 Relations between the United \nStates and France are active and friendly. Differences are discussed frankly and have \nnot generally been allowed to impair the pattern of close cooperation that characterizes \nrelations between the two countries. France has significantly increased participation in \nNATO\u2019s military wing in recent years. Although France opposed the U.S. invasion of \nIraq, France has 2,200 soldiers serving in Afghanistan, and assisted in assembling $21 \nbillion in pledges for economic assistance to Afghanistan. France is a close ally of the \nUnited States in the war on terrorism.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.7 \n \n3  See Appellate Exhibits 1-4. \n \n4  In her October 30, 2008 comments (Appellate Exhibit 3) to my Order, Applicant promised never \nto use her French identification card as a travel document again, and stated practical reasons for her to \nkeep the French identification card. In her October 31, 2008 comments (Appellate Exhibit 4), Applicant \nstated her willingness to surrender her French identification card. She indicated she had conferred with \nthe French Embassy in the United States and was informed that by surrendering her French identification \ncard she would not be renouncing her French citizenship, but renouncing her ability to exercise her rights \nas a French citizen. \n \n5  Id. \n \n6  Adjudication of security concerns under Guideline B require the consideration of the foreign \ncountry involved and its relationship with the United States (AG \u00b6 6). The source the facts in this \nparagraph is the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs August 2008, \n\u201cBackground Note: France,\u201d available at http://www.state.gov. I marked the document Appellate Exhibit 5. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d8 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n \n7  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n8  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nApplicant was born in France to a French mother and a native born U.S. father. \nShe is a dual citizen of the United States and France. She was raised and educated in \nFrance. Up to her hearing date, Applicant has enjoyed all the privileges and rights of \nFrench citizens. Applicant\u2019s possession and use of a French passport in preference of \nher U.S. passport, as well as her use of the French education, healthcare, and banking \nsystem shows she is exercising her French citizenship and preference for France. She \nworked in France, voted in French elections, and retained a French identification card, \nall constituting an exercise of French citizenship and raising security concerns under \nGuideline C.  \n \n \nAt her hearing, during the October 23, 2008 conference call, and in her October \n30, 2008 comments, Applicant declined to surrender her French identification card \nbecause she believed that would be tantamount to renouncing her French citizenship. In \nher October 31, 2008 comments, she indicated: \u201cI would in fact be willing to surrender \nit.\u201d However, Applicant provided no evidence she had surrendered her French \nidentification card. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises security concerns under foreign preference \ndisqualifying condition AG 10(a): \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes . . . (1): possession of a current foreign passport . . ., (3) \naccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits, and \n(7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d \n \n \nIn 2004, at age 18, she travelled to the United States to attend college and since \nthen she has made the United States her home. She also has worked for U.S. \ngovernment contractors. All of Applicant\u2019s financial and economic ties (except for a \nsmall French bank account) are in the United States. She has no other financial, \neconomic, or proprietary interests in any foreign country. Applicant averred all her \nactions (requesting and using a French passport, holding a French bank account, her \nuse of the French healthcare system, voting in France, and keeping her French \nidentification card) were motivated by practical reasons and do not reflect a preference \nfor France over the United States. She surrendered her French passport to her security \nofficer on June 23, 2008. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nThese facts warrant partial application of foreign preference mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a): \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry:\u201d 11(c): \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred . . . when the individual was a minor;\u201d and 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  \n \n \nNotwithstanding, these mitigating conditions do not fully apply. Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity concerns were raised by her exercise of her French citizenship after she \nbecame an adult. Applicant requested and used a French passport in preference to her \nU.S. passport in 2006. She surrendered her French passport and that mitigated the \npassport specific issues. However, Applicant continues to exercise her French \ncitizenship. As of October 2008, she still had a French bank account and possessed a \nvalid French identification card. In 2008, she used the French healthcare system and \nvoted in French elections. Applicant\u2019s French identification card allows her to travel in \nand out of France, and other European countries. Considering the record as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s continued exercise of her French citizenship fails to mitigate the foreign \npreference security concerns. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.9 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with her parents and grandmother who are \ncitizens and residents of France. The closeness of the relationship is shown by \nApplicant\u2019s frequent e-mail, telephone contacts, and trips to France. This contact \ncreates a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the \npossibility that French agents or terrorists may exploit the opportunity to obtain \ninformation about the United States. Her connection to her parents also creates a \npotential conflict of interest because her relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern about her desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified \ninformation.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nOne Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition under AG \u00b6 8 is applicable to these \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. \n \nI do not believe Applicant\u2019s close relationships create a heightened risk of foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation because the nature of the relations between the \nUnited States and France (active and friendly). France and the United States share \ncommon values and have parallel policies on most political, economic, and security \nissues. France is considered one of our oldest allies, and its government does not have \na history of abusing or exploiting their citizens or U.S. citizens. \n \nSince 2004, Applicant has made the United States her home. She attended an \nAmerican university and has worked hard for defense contractors for approximately two \nyears. All of Applicant\u2019s financial and economic ties (except for a small French bank \n \n9  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \naccount) are in the United States. She surrendered her French passport. She has \npromised to use her skill and abilities to protect and promote United States\u2019 interests.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant is 22 years old and has only lived in the United States four years. She \ncredibly asserted her desire to help protect and promote the United States interests. \nApplicant lived in France because she was a minor under the control of her parents. \nShe attended an international high school and spoke English at home with her parents \nand grandmother, who provided her with a strong American influence. When she turned \n18 in 2004, she moved to the United States and has lived in the United States \nthereafter.  \n \nIn a short period, she has established herself in the United States. She has \nworked hard for government contractors earning their trust. There is no evidence she \nhas ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States, or that \nshe lacks honesty and integrity. Her family is not likely to be vulnerable to coercion or \nexploitation by a foreign power or terrorist organizations in France. \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, numerous circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis. Applicant\u2019s security concerns were raised by her \nexercise of her French citizenship after emancipation. Applicant requested and used a \nFrench passport in preference to her U.S. passport in 2006. As of October 2008, she \nstill had a French bank account and possesses a valid French identification card. In \n2008, she used the French healthcare system and voted in French elections. Applicant \nreceived credit for surrendering her French passport. However, she possesses a valid \nFrench identification card that allows her to travel in and out of France, and other \nEuropean countries. Although she is willing to surrender her French identification card, \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence she surrendered it. Her exercise of her French \ncitizenship creates doubt as to whether she would have a preference for France over \nthe United States. \n \nI considered the longstanding, active and friendly relationship between France \nand the United States, and that both countries share common values, and have parallel \npolicies on most political, economic, and security issues. Notwithstanding, a friendly \nrelationship is not determinative. Friendly countries may have profound disagreements \nwith the United States or have engaged in espionage against the United States \nespecially in economic, scientific, military, and technical fields. Even friendly countries \ncan attempt to gain unauthorized access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 08-\n0592 (App. Bd. May 4, 1999). Nothing in Guidelines B or C requires that the foreign \ncountry in question have interests that are inimical to the interests of the United States. \nISCR Case No. 97-0699 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 1998). \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  \n \nOn balance, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the \nfacts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence, but failed to mitigate the \nforeign preference security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n1.d - 1.f: \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is\ndenied.\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), which he signed on March 31, 2006 (GE 2). After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\nJanuary 26, 2009\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n \n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\n2\n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent\n1\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn August 12, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nwhich specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).2\nApplicant received the SOR on August 18, 2008. He signed his notarized Answer on\nSeptember 3, 2008, in which he admitted to all allegations in the Statement of Reasons,\nexcept allegation 2.e. While he admits to the accident alleged in that allegation, he denies\nthat he received a citation or was required to appear in court as a result. He also requested\na hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 19, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me on September 22, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October\n22, 2008 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 10, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, the Department Counsel offered 15 exhibits, which were marked\nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 15, and admitted without objection. Applicant\ntestified and also presented the testimony of six witnesses. He offered three exhibits,\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr) on November 18, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations, as well as those  in response to the\nDOHA interrogatories (GE 3), are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings,\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant, 39 years old, graduated high school and attended college for\napproximately one year. He is unmarried and has no children. Applicant has worked in the\ninformation technology field for the past 13 years (GE 1). His current position is Information\nSystems Security Officer (ISSO) for a defense contractor. The position involves securing\ngovernment computer systems from illegal access (Tr 121). He has not held a security\nclearance in the past (Tr.10).\n\nIn 2005, Applicant appealed to the governor of the state in which he was incarcerated for a pardon of his\n3 \nfelony convictions. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not received a response (Tr 150; AE C).\n3\nIn September 1990, when Applicant was 21 years old, he charged goods using a\ncredit card that was not his own, by forging the card-holder\u2019s name (Tr 126; 143). He was\nconvicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail, suspended, and two years probation (GE 3). He\ncompleted his probation early, after approximately one year (Tr 145). In 1991, while he was\nstill on probation, he engaged in other criminal conduct. He drove through a parking lot with\na friend who tried to steal a woman\u2019s pocketbook. Applicant was not prosecuted for this\noffense (Tr 149). \nWhile on probation, in February 1991, Applicant also committed computer fraud. He\npurchased a used computer through a local newspaper, and decided to see if he could\naccess a bank\u2019s computer system (Tr 138). Using the \u201csocial engineering\u201c technique, he\ncalled a bank receptionist and asked questions about the bank, hoping to learn information\nthat would allow him to \u201chack\u201d into the bank\u2019s computers. The plan succeeded. When his\nroommate learned what Applicant had done, he asked Applicant to transfer funds from\ndepositors\u2019 accounts to the roommate\u2019s account. Applicant sought out accounts with large\nbalances of $100,000 to $200,000. On six occasions, he transferred from $500 to $1,000\nfrom six different accounts, for a total theft of $5,300 (Tr 116 - 118; GE 3). The police\nconfiscated the computer Applicant used in the crime (Tr 147).\nIn March 1991, Applicant was charged with one count of Computer Access and\nFraud, a felony, and six counts of Grand Theft of Personal Property, also felonies. He pled\n\u201cNo Contest\u201d to all counts and was sentenced to three years incarceration (Tr 128; GE 2;\nGE 4). He served just over two years and was granted three years parole, which was\ndischarged in 1996 (Tr 148).3\nWhile Applicant was incarcerated, authorities determined that the confiscated\ncomputer he used to commit fraud was stolen. He testified that he did not know it was\nstolen when he bought it through a newspaper advertisement (Tr 147). He was charged with\nReceiving Stolen Goods. He pled guilty and was sentenced to two years incarceration, to\nbe served concurrently with his sentence for computer fraud (Tr 144). \nFrom 1995 to 1997, Applicant was employed by a motion picture production company\nas a Branch Systems Specialist (GE 2). In Fall 1997, he received an expense check, which\nhe asked his roommate to deposit. His roommate used the check to produce a counterfeit\nversion, made out in his own name, which he signed and tried to cash. When the roommate\nwas apprehended by police, he contacted Applicant, who refused to help him, and\nsubsequently severed all ties with him. Applicant\u2019s employer did not file charges, but\ninformed him that he would be terminated. Rather than have a termination on his record,\nApplicant resigned (Tr 132 - 138).\n\nDirective. 6.3.\n3 \n4\nOver a 12-year period, from 1996 through 2008, Applicant committed 10 civil\ninfractions (GE 5 through 15). His traffic violations included failure to properly display his\nlicense tag and county registration, improper turning, and failure to stop. He also received\nfive citations for speeding. Applicant failed to appear in court in response to a November\n1996 speeding ticket, and in March 1997, he was charged with failure to appear (GE 5). He\ntestified that because he did not live in the state where he was cited, he mailed the fine to\nthe court, but it might not have been received in time (Tr 159). Another of Applicant\u2019s\nspeeding citations, in May 1998, resulted when Applicant\u2019s speed and inattention caused an\naccident. Applicant again failed to appear in court. Applicant admits that police at the scene\nwrote a report, and that he was at fault in the collision, but denies that he received a citation\nfrom the police to appear in court (Tr 130-131). In October 1998, he was charged with failure\nto appear (GE 6). \nSeveral witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant\u2019s Personal Representative\nand friend testified that he knows that Applicant is highly trustworthy. The Personal\nRepresentative was involved in a serious accident which left him in a coma for three months.\nDuring that time, Applicant had access to a large amount of his friend\u2019s cash, but it was\nintact when the Personal Representative regained consciousness (Tr 36). Applicant\u2019s\nsecond-line supervisor testified that despite Applicant\u2019s computer fraud conviction (Tr 71),\nhe is honest and committed to his work (Tr 64). Two friends who have known Applicant for\nyears testified that he is reliable and trustworthy (Tr 94-95; 106). Appellant is a volunteer with\na Community Emergency Response Team, which assists county emergency teams when\nthey are overwhelmed (Tr 120). He is also a 1st Lieutenant with the Air Force Civil Air Patrol,\nwhere he teaches cadets about leadership and \u201chow to keep their lives on the straight and\nnarrow.\u201d (Tr 121). Applicant has received awards for his work in relation to Y2K\npreparedness and for preventing security intrusions into federal government computer\nsystems (AE B).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy\nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this case, the\npleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration of the security\nconcerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline H (drug involvement) and\nGuideline E (personal conduct).  \n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n5\n          A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue\n5\nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to\nprove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls\nto the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has\na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person\n6\nwho has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\nThe facts raise three disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses); AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted);\nand AG \u00b6 31(e) (violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated\nrehabilitation program). Applicant admitted to and was convicted on charges of computer\nfraud and grand theft, a total of seven felony counts. He served 2 years in jail and 3 years\non parole. AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply. AG 31(e) also applies because while on probation for\nthe forgery charge, Applicant committed the felonies of computer fraud and grand theft, in\nviolation of his probation requirement to obey the law. \nGuideline J also includes mitigating conditions, two of which are relevant: AG \u00b6 32(a)\n(so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\n\n6\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence\nof successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement). \nNeither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG  \u00b6 32(d) mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct. Many years have\npassed since Applicant engaged in the criminal conduct of the early 1990s. However, this\nmitigating condition requires not only that the criminal behavior occur in the distant past, but\nthat the criminal behavior not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s offenses\nwere fraud, forgery, and theft, crimes of dishonesty that are the opposite of reliability and\ntrust, and do cast doubt on his present trustworthiness and good judgment. As to AG \u00b6\n32(d), Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation by admitting his failures, volunteering\nwithin his community, and performing commendably in his employment. However, the\npersistence of Applicant\u2019s civil infractions create a disturbing pattern that undermines his\nrehabilitation, and raises questions about his willingness and/or ability to abide by rules and\nregulations. \nPersonal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nAvailable evidence supports application of AG \u00b6 16(c): \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under\nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a\nwhole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information;\nApplicant\u2019s behavior demonstrates a consistent willingness to disregard rules and\nregulations. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, standing alone, might not raise sufficient doubt\nto deny a security clearance, because of its distance in time. However, when considered\nwith his continuing civil infractions, a pattern emerges that indicates his willingness to\nplace his own needs above the law. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies.\n\n7\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is relevant (the offense is so minor, or so much time\nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). A significant amount of time has passed\nsince Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct\u2013 approximately 18 years since Applicant\u2019s first criminal\noffense, and 12 years since his parole on felony charges was discharged in 1996. But the\nyear his parole ended, in 1996, his long series of civil infractions began. They have\ncontinued up to July 2008, just 7 months ago. Although these infractions are not criminal\nin nature, they do demonstrate Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations and raise doubts about his good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) cannot be applied.\nWhole Person Analysis  \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nThe evidence shows that Applicant engaged in serious criminal conduct in his early\n20s, including forgery, attempted robbery, computer fraud, grand theft, and receiving\nstolen goods. He served time in jail and on parole. A key consideration in this\ndetermination is that several of the crimes involved deliberate and calculated dishonesty.\nApplicant tricked a bank employee into disclosing information that would enable him to\ngain access to the bank\u2019s computer system. He used his computer skills to deprive others\nof their money and to enrich himself and/or his roommate. In all these acts, he placed his\nown desires above the rule of law.\nIn the years since the end of his parole in 1996, Applicant has made commendable\nchanges in his life that cannot be dismissed lightly. He has distinguished himself as a solid\nemployee, and his co-workers, supervisors and friends trust and depend on him. His\n\n8\ncomputer skills now serve to protect government computer systems from the kind of illegal\nhacking that he engaged in years ago. He contributes to his community, and seeks to use\nhis own mistakes as a lesson to pass on to the cadets he teaches.\nBut in 1996, at the very time his parole ended, Applicant began a series of\ninfractions that have continued until just a few months ago. Taken together, they form a\ndisturbing pattern that cannot be ignored. Although superficially they appear minor, in fact,\nthey stem from the same underlying impulse to disregard the law that Applicant displayed\nwhen he violated the law in the 1990s. Access to classified information imposes an\nobligation to adhere to laws and regulations, and it cannot be granted to one who is\nunwilling to accept that obligation.  \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline J\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to\nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied.\nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His 1997 \nChapter 7 Bankruptcy was not recent. He paid or settled and paid the ten debts listed \non the statement of reasons (SOR). He does not currently have any delinquent debt. \nClearance is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 1, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). \nOn October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an \nissued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility \nfor access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 30, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 31, 2009. On February 18, \n2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 11, 2009. At the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits (GEs 1-9) (Transcript (Tr.) 20-22), \nand Applicant offered five exhibits (Tr. 23-25; AE A-E). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 22), and AEs A-E (Tr. 26). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 10-12). I received the transcript on \nMarch 17, 2009. I held the record open until March 18, 2009 (Tr. 74). I received AEs F, \nG, and H after the hearing and they were admitted without objection (Tr. 74; AE F, G, \nH). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debts listed in \nthe SOR, said he had paid the SOR debts; however, he was waiting for confirmatory \ndocumentation of the debt\u2019s resolution (GE 12). His admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old (Tr. 6). He graduated from high school in 1971 (Tr. 6). \nHe did not attend college (Tr. 6). He currently has a top secret security clearance; \nhowever, he has previously held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (Tr. 7-8). He first received a security clearance in 1978, \nwhen he was serving on active duty as a U.S. Marine (Tr. 7).  He served in the U.S. \nMarines from March 1977 to May 1980 and then from April 1981 to May 1991 (Tr. 28-\n29; GE 1). He left active duty as a noncommissioned officer (Tr. 29). He married in \nOctober 1980 and was separated from his spouse in October 2003 (Tr. 29). His divorce \nwas final in July 2006 (Tr. 29).  \n \nIn the 1990s, Applicant had a medical problem similar to a stroke and was \npartially paralyzed (Tr. 37). He was an inpatient for about seven months and then \nreceived outpatient therapy about eight hours a day for four months (Tr. 37, 44-45). He \nreceived sixty percent of his pay while on long-term disability (Tr. 38). His debts became \ndelinquent because of the loss of income. In 1997, his debts were discharged under a \nChapter 7 Bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a).   \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant eventually recovered sufficiently to return to full employment. However, \nin January 2005, Applicant received an injury to his elbow and shoulder and again went \non long-term disability (Tr. 33, 36). He received disability pay until January 2006 (Tr. \n35). Around June of 2005, a defense contractor hired Applicant for sporadic, part time \nemployment (Tr. 33-34). He fell behind on his debts because he was only receiving sixty \npercent of his pay, while he was on long-term disability (Tr. 39-40).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s current employer has employed him for the last two years as a \nsecurity agent (Tr. 30). His current employment is part time, usually about 32 hours a \nweek; however, he also receives occasional overtime pay (Tr. 30-31; AE G). Applicant \nhas full-time employment at another firm waiting, provided he receives a security \nclearance as a result of this proceeding (Tr. 32-33). He is not currently receiving any \ndisability pay (Tr. 46).  \n \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) lists a 1997 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \ndischarge of his debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and ten delinquent debts, totaling $12,066 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b to 1.k). In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he said he paid the SOR debts and was \nwaiting for proof of payment (GE 12). Applicant established through his hearing \nstatement and the following documents that his SOR debts were paid or settled and \npaid:  \n \n(1) credit card judgment for $763 (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Tr. 38-39, 68, AE G);  \n \n(2) credit card judgment for $1,316 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, Tr. 38-39, 69; AE A);  \n \n(3) credit card debt for $2,858 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, Tr. 40-41, 54, 69; AE C at 2);  \n \n(4) credit card debt for $2,428 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, Tr. 40-41, 54, 70; AE C at 3);  \n \n(5) credit card charge for $29, which is part of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d (SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nTr. 40-41, 70; GE 12, AE G);  \n \n(6) credit card debt for $2,951 (SOR \u00b6 1.g, Tr. 42, 54-57, 71; AE C at 1, AE D);  \n \n(7) credit card debt for $482 (SOR \u00b6 1.h, Tr. 42-43, 71; AE B at 3);  \n \n(8) credit card debt for $346, which is part of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h (SOR \u00b6 1.i, \nTr. 42-43, 71; AE B at 3, GE 12);  \n \n(9) credit card debt for $251 (SOR \u00b6 1.j, Tr. 43); and \n \n(10) credit card debt for $642 (SOR 1.k, Tr. 71-72; AE G, AE H). \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n Applicant did not recognize one judgment for $498 filed on January 5, 2000 (Tr. \n58-59; GE 5). He recently paid the two SOR judgments for $1,316 and $763 filed in \n2004 (Tr. 60-61; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c; GE 6 and 7).   \n \nApplicant originally planned to use a credit counseling service (CCS) to resolve \nhis SOR debts and he began CCS\u2019 process of debt resolution in October 2008 (Tr. 47-\n51; GR 8). He gave CCS about $500; however, CCS wanted him to contact all creditors \nand determine the amount of his debts (Tr. 48-49). After contacting his creditors, he \nchose to pay his debts without using that CCS\u2019 services (Tr. 48-49). CCS has agreed to \nrefund $487 to Applicant (Tr. 49).   \n \nApplicant has not had any problems paying his rent (Tr. 62). He owns two \nvehicles and they are both paid off (Tr. 63). He has about $100 in savings (Tr. 63) and \nabout $2,100 set aside for emergencies (AE H). He has two credit cards, one has $500 \non it and the other does not have any charges on it (Tr. 65). His credit cards are current \n(Tr. 66). He does not have any other credit accounts and all accounts, such as for \nutilities and cell phones are current (Tr. 66-67).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \n\n \n \n5 \n \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR \n\n \n \n6 \n \nresponse and at his hearing. In 1997, Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged using Chapter \n7 Bankruptcy. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.k, he had ten delinquent debts totaling \nabout $12,066. Several debts became delinquent as early as 2004. Several SOR debts \nwere not paid until December 2008. The government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his ten delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because his financial problems \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply \nbecause he did not dispute any of the SOR debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged due to medical \nproblems, reduction of income while he was on disability, underemployment, \nunemployment, and divorce. He lacked the income to pay some of his debts. About two \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \nyears ago, he obtained his current employment and thereafter he paid his SOR debts. \nHe established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.2  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant received financial counseling. He paid his \ndelinquent debts. Moreover, there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d He understands the security implications of delinquent \ndebt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant showed good faith3 in the resolution of \nhis SOR debts.    \n \nAlthough Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts, his payment of the remaining SOR debts in \nDecember 2008 are adequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Around 1995-1996, \nApplicant had delinquent debts because his disability pay was insufficient to repay his \ncreditors. His delinquent, unsecured debts were discharged in 1997 using a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy. The SOR lists ten debts totalling $12,066 that were at one time or another \ndelinquent during the last four years. He failed to keep his accounts current and \nnegotiate lesser payments when his income decreased, showing some financial \nirresponsibility and lack of judgment. When he returned to employment, he did not \naggressively seek debt repayment or resolution. His history of delinquent debt raises \nsufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. Serious \nmedical problems caused his income to significantly decline, and his debts became \ndelinquent. Ultimately, he paid his delinquent SOR debts. His remaining debts are \ncurrent. He only has two credit cards and one has a zero balance, the other has a \nbalance of about $500. The loans on both of his vehicles are paid. The Appeal Board \nhas addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \n\n \n \n9 \n \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is a security agent. He is a high school graduate, but did not attend college. \nHe is not sophisticated in the area of finance. He made mistakes, and debts became \ndelinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments by actually paying all of his \ndelinquent SOR debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \nHe honorably served more than ten years on active duty as a U.S. Marine. He left active \nduty as a gunnery sergeant. He had demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and \ntrustworthiness through many years of service to the U.S. Marines and to the \nDepartment of Defense through his employment with defense contractors. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.k: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 23, 2009.

She is paying her VA obligation through monthly offsets to \nher disability payments and income tax refunds. After these payments, Applicant \ncontinues to owe $54,000 in delinquent debt. These debts arose 2000, and are not \nrecently incurred financial obligations. She does have one current credit card debt with \na $900 balance. The 1996 divorce decree awarded her $37,500 of a workers \ncompensation payment for an injury received by her husband during the course of their \nmarriage. That money has been spent long ago. Applicant had not filed her 2009 \nincome tax forms at the time of the hearing, but her taxes were paid by payroll \ndeductions. She expects her federal tax refund will be taken for the VA debt.  (Tr. 98, \n103, 134; Exhibits 2-8) \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character statements. A co-worker for the past three \nyears and now her supervisor stated Applicant is \u201cdedicated and honest.\u201d She is also \n\n6 \n \n\u201cvery loyal and trustworthy.\u201d Another co-worker wrote a favorable letter for Applicant. \nHer April 2010 evaluation rated her as \u201caverage\u201d with several favorable comments. She \nwas hired by her employer in April 2003. Her landlord wrote a letter on her behalf stating \nshe is a good tenant for the past year and he has no problems with her or her family \nmembers in the house. (Exhibits D, E, X, Y) \n \n \nApplicant and her oldest son testified at the hearing. They explained the history \nof Applicant\u2019s financial problems and her support of all her children, to her financial \ndetriment. Both were credible witnesses. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by an applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.\u201d  \n \n\n7 \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has \nbeen unable to pay these obligations for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes six conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. Three conditions may be applicable to Applicant.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose \nfrom 2000 forward to the present time. These circumstances have been modified.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nApplicant got a job in 2003. At the same time her three children were an \nincreasing financial drain on her resources from 2000 to 2008. Her oldest son was in jail \nfor six years and she took it upon herself to support him upon his release. Her daughter \nis disabled and took out two credit cards in Applicant\u2019s name without her permission. \nThe youngest child has two children and Applicant gave him $10,000 from her meager \nearnings for support between 2006 and 2008. Her shift change in May 2008 caused her \nto lose $11,000 income annually. Applicant has now ceased supporting two of her \nchildren and her third son is managing her money. I find the financial behavior of \nincurring debt and not repaying it while making support payments to her children \noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur because of her \noldest son\u2019s control of her finances, and his efforts at self-support, have resulted in a \nreduction of Applicant\u2019s gifts to her children and a more organized attempt to resolve \nher delinquent debts. These situations do not raise concerns about her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this potentially \nmitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ She divorced from her \nsecond husband in 1996.  He subsequently died. Applicant had the responsibility of \nsupporting and caring for her three children, who did not work. Her daughter in 1996 \nwas 23 years old, her oldest son was 14, and the youngest child was 11 years old. Only \nher oldest son is making any current attempt to support himself. Furthermore, Applicant \nhad 13 surgeries during that time period until 2003 to correct an injury from 1996.  \n \nApplicant had a divorce, death, imprisonment of her son, unexpected medical \nemergencies, and two adult children who do not work. While married to her second \nhusband it also appears she did not work regularly.  More importantly, between 1996 \nand 2003 she was unemployed. She acted responsibly in identifying and attempting to \nresolve some of these debts within the restrictions of her income. I conclude this \npotentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). There is no evidence of counseling; hence \nthis mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated \na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nresolved three of the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. This mitigating \ncondition has limited application.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e) states \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputes in writing six of the delinquent debts for \n\n9 \n \nvarious reasons. She has a reasonable basis for each dispute. This mitigating condition \nis applicable.  \n \nFinally, AG \u00b6 20 (f) provides \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source of \nincome\u201d has no applicability. Applicant has clearly shown she is not affluent.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a substantial amount \nof delinquent debt. The two largest debts are owed to the VA for medical bills and a \nbank on a line of credit her late former husband incurred. She is paying the third largest \ndebt (the dental bill) regularly. Four debts are owed by her daughter and her youngest \nson. Applicant is an adult and the parent in the family when all this debt was incurred \nwithin the past decade. Her ability to repay it was hampered by her parental obligations \nfor support of her adult children and grandchildren. After 2008 Applicant reduced the \npayments she made to her youngest child. But her monthly expenditures continue to \nexceed her monthly income, at least on the mathematical calculations of her income \nand expenses. Applicant attempts to pay the debts she admits she owes and seeks \ninformation from the creditors whose claims she disputes. Within the lilmits of her \nincome, Applicant is doing what she can to resolve her debts and provide for her \ndependant adult family. It is a difficult situation, but one that does not appear to have \nany other solution than that now being implemented by Applicant.  \n \nApplicant is a trustworthy and honest person. Her frank discussion of her debts \nand family obligations demonstrates those qualities. The totality of the evidence \nconcerning Applicant applied on a fair and commonsense basis shows Applicant can be \ntrusted with sensitive information, as she has been for the past seven years. Her past \nperformance is an indication of the likelihood of her future performance.  \n\n10 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.p:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline D, Sexual \nBehavior. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a determination \nbe made in his case without a hearing.  On April 16, 2009, Department Counsel \nprepared a File Of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM was mailed to Applicant on \nApril 17, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on April 23, 2009. He had thirty days from \nthe receipt of the FORM to submit additional matters. He timely submitted additional \nmatters. On May 20, 2009, Department Counsel indicated that they had no objection to \nthe additional matters. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2009. Based upon a \nJune 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, admits to  \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and neither admits or denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \nHis failure to admit or deny the allegation SOR \u00b6 1.c is treated as a denial.   \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to obtain a security clearance.  He is a ship fitter and has worked for his current \nemployer since April 2003. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He \nrecently married and has three children. (Item 3)   \n \nOn October 2, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of \nsexual battery, a misdemeanor offense, and two counts of indecent liberties with a child, \na felony offense. The alleged offenses occurred on November 1, 2005, and April 24, \n2006. No specific details regarding the offenses are provided in the record. (Item 5; Item \n6. Item 7) \n \nOn March 13, 2007, Applicant pled guilty to two counts of sexual battery, a \nmisdemeanor. He was sentenced to 12 months in jail, suspended, ordered to pay $150 \ncourt costs, and given three years unsupervised probation. (Item 6) The indecent liberty \ncharges were nolle prossed. (Item 6) Applicant was required to register as a sexual \noffender on his state\u2019s web-site because of his guilty plea and conviction of two counts \nof sexual battery. (Item 7)  \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denies that he pled guilty to sexual battery. \nHe claims that he entered an Alford plea because he would not admit to something that \nhe did not do. (Item 3) In his response to the FORM, postmarked May 11, 2009, \nApplicant states that his probation was complete on March 16, 2009. He did not provide \ndocumentation from the court system verifying his probation was terminated. He \nindicated that his only regret is that he did not fight his case. He pled because he \nbelieved he had too much to lose. (Response to FORM, postmarked May 11, 2009)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \n\u00b630 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b631(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b631(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and charges of two counts of Sexual Battery and two counts of \nIndecent Liberties with a Child. He pled guilty to two counts of Sexual Battery. The \nIndecent Liberty charges were nolle prossed.  \n \nWhile the record lacks specific information about the specific conduct that was \nthe basis for the charges, the government established a prima facie case under criminal \nconduct. Since the government produced substantial evidence to raise disqualifying \nconditions under the criminal conduct concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See, ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b632(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, \nor it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). The criminal \ncharges were relatively recent.  Although Applicant claims he entered an Alford plea, \nthe court records indicate that he pled guilty to two counts of sexual battery. There is not \nenough information for me to conclude CC MC \u00b6 32(a) applies. \n \nCC MC \u00b632(c ) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) does not \napply. Applicant claims that he entered an Alford plea because he did not commit the \noffense.  Court records indicate Applicant pled guilty to two misdemeanor offenses of \nsexual battery.  The record does not contain additional evidence to corroborate \nApplicant\u2019s claims of innocence.  \n \nCC MC \u00b632(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) does not apply. Not enough time has passed to conclude \nApplicant has been successfully rehabilitated. Applicant was sentenced to three years \nprobation which would end in March 2010.  Applicant claims that he has completed \nprobation but provided no proof that his probation has terminated. He provided no \ninformation about his employment record and/or community involvement.  \n \nThere is not enough information in the record to conclude Applicant mitigated the \ncriminal conduct concern. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the sexual behavior guideline is set forth in \n\u00b612 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the \nindividual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nSexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a \ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted) \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress) \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on two counts of sexual battery and two counts of \nindecent liberties with a minor. SB DC \u00b6 13(a) applies. These arrests and the underlying \nbehavior that led to the arrests make Applicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. SB DC \u00b6 13(b) applies.  The sexual behavior also reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment since Applicant\u2019s behavior resulted in criminal charges being brought against. \nSB DC \u00b6 13(d) applies. \n \n \nConcerns raised under Sexual Behavior can be mitigated. The following \nmitigating conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \n \nSexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior \nhappened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. The offenses were relative recent. \nApplicant was charged with more than one offense so it cannot be concluded the \nunlawful sexual behavior was isolated.  There is insufficient evidence in the record for \nme to conclude Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment are sound.    \n \n \nSB MC \u00b6 14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress) does not apply. Applicant is still vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nSB MC \u00b6 14(d) (the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet) \ndoes not apply. There is insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether this \nmitigating condition applies.   \n \n \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised under \nsexual behavior.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has \nworked for the same defense contractor over the past six years. However, he did not \nprovide information pertaining to his work performance. I considered that Applicant was \narrested and charged with two counts of sexual battery and two counts of indecent \nliberties with a minor. I considered that he pled and was found guilty of two counts of \nsexual battery. The government established a prima facie case to raise concerns under \ncriminal conduct and sexual behavior. As such, the burden switched to Applicant to \nmitigate the concerns raised under the criminal conduct and sexual behavior concerns. \nHe did not mitigate the concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n  \n  \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant was \ntold what to do and followed that advice. Following his evaluation, he sought and \nreceived treatment for the problem, and is not a risk to his children or other children. \nApplicant did not disclose a denial of an application for SCI eligibility because he \ncompleted his security questionnaire as directed by the Director of Corporate Special \nSecurity. Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under \nsexual behavior and personal conduct. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nDecember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 24, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nsexual behavior and personal conduct. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received April 17, 2009, in which he \nrequested a hearing. On June 10, 2009, I was assigned the case. On July 7, 2009, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing, which was held on August 4, \n2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through G, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On August 10, 2009, additional material was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the \nrecord as Ex. H. On August 12, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admits the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 2.b, with explanations. He denies the remaining factual allegations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of \nthe record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old assistant technical center manager who has worked for \na defense contractor since August 1993, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nCoworkers and supervisors state Applicant is level-headed, hard-working, dedicated, a \nconscientious project leader, and excellent manager who has a stellar reputation. (Tr. \n26-32, Ex. D, Ex. E) Applicant was a deputy program manager before becoming a site \nmanager. (Tr. 73)  \n \n \nApplicant admits that at age 13, he attempted sexual intercourse with his six year \nold sister. (Answer to SOR, Ex. 2, page 14) In 1981, Applicant, then age 23, became \nsexual aroused when he took a bath with a 4-year-old boy. (Ex. 2, page 12; Ex. 3, page \n13) In 1992, Applicant told his one-year-old daughter to touch his penis as he sat on the \ntoilet. He became sexually aroused from the encounter. (Ex. 2, page 12; Ex. 3, page 13, \n14) In 1994, Applicant touched his one-year-old son\u2019s penis when he was changing his \nson\u2019s diaper. (Tr. 128, Ex. 2, page 13; Ex. 3, page 13) In 1997, Applicant became \nsexually aroused while rubbing his daughter\u2019s buttocks. His daughter was between six \nand seven years old. (Ex. 2, page 13) At the hearing, Applicant stated he did not recall \nsaying he had become sexually aroused. He stated the \u201ctwinge\u201d was one of guilt, that \nhe felt it was wrong to touch his daughter\u2019s buttocks. (Tr. 50, 80, 82)  \n \n \n  \n \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \nIn 1997, a number of these sexual incidents were made known to the \ngovernment. (Tr. 66) In September 2000, during a security interview, Applicant reported \n(Tr. 78) that:  \n \napproximately once out of every twenty times he masturbates, he \nfantasizes about having sexual intercourse with his [ten-year-old] \ndaughter. He also tries to visualize what his daughter will look like when \nshe gets older, and he admitted that his daughter reminds him of his ex-\ngirlfriend. (Ex. 3, page 14)  \n \n \nApplicant stated this had occurred when his daughter was age 2 or 3 in 1993 or \n1994 due to her hairstyle and the hairstyle of a former girlfriend. (Tr. 127) Applicant \ndenied consciously trying to focus on his daughter\u2019s face and her face lessened his \narousal. Since 2001, when Applicant revealed these events, he has been involved in no \ntype of sexual misconduct. (Tr. 58) \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was referred to the county Department of Juvenile Justice for \nevaluation of the degree of risk present to children. Applicant and both his children were \ninterviewed in December 2001 and January 2002. (Tr. 46) He underwent the Minnesota \nMultiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). (Tr. 61) During that evaluation, Applicant told \nthe evaluator he fantasized about the faces and features of women in his life while \nmasturbating. His daughter\u2019s face was similar in features to an old girlfriend. While \nmasturbating, Applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s face appears in his mind. (Ex. 2, page 13) \nApplicant has not had any images of his daughter while masturbating since 1993 or \n1994. (Tr. 106)  \n \n \nThe evaluator, a licensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC) found: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] events suggest a periodic chronic pattern of difficulty with \nmanaging power and control situations in his life. . . At other times, \n[Applicant\u2019s] response to stress and isolation has been to utilize poor \njudgment in his care taking role as parent . . . [Applicant\u2019s] does not deny \nhis behaviors and was the person to volunteer the information originally; \nhowever, he exhibits no understanding or insight into the rationale of his \nbehaviors . . . [Applicant] exhibited the intellectual capacity and motivation \nto benefit from treatment . . . [Applicant] does not represent an immediate \nrisk to his children; however, he reports behaviors consistent with others \nwho commit child sexual abuse . . . [Applicant] may benefit from outpatient \ntreatment from a professional with training is sexual offense treatment. \n(Ex. 2, page 18) \n \n \nFrom February 2002 to July 2002, Applicant participated in family counseling. \nApplicant met with the counselor once a week for individual therapy sessions. The \ncounselor was trained in sexual offense treatment. (Tr. 100) Applicant explained all the \nsexual conduct to his counselor. (Tr. 102)  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                          \n \nFrom August 2002 through June 2004, Applicant met with another doctor weekly \nfor the same problem. (Ex. 2, page 24 and 28) His therapist stated Applicant appeared \nnot to be withholding any information and was straightforward in his presentation. (Ex. \n3) As of November 2002, Applicant had seen her for 16 sessions. (Ex. B) However, the \nsessions continued for two years. (Tr. 123) His therapist stated Applicant was \ncooperative and engaged in the process of his therapy. (Ex. 3) Neither doctor found any \nconcern about the safety of Applicant\u2019s children. (Ex. 3, page 41, 42, Ex. B, Ex) \nCounseling stopped when Applicant believed he had worked through all the issues that \nwere of concern. (Tr. 125-126) \n \n \nIn February 2002, Applicant was not granted access to sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI) based on information gathered during the security process. (Answer to \nSOR, Ex. 3, page 11) Applicant appealed the denial of his SCI access. In April 2002, his \nappeal was denied. (Ex. 3, page 16) In May 2002, Applicant was informed he could \nappeal the decision to the Agency\u2019s Access Appeals Panel. (Ex. 3, page 17) In \nDecember 2002, Applicant was allowed to continue processing his request for access to \nSCI. (Ex. 3, page 18, Tr. 53) It was Applicant\u2019s understanding that the original decision \ndenying his SCI access had been overturned. (Tr. 117) Applicant did not receive his SCI \naccess, but was allowed to continue the process. The letter granting Applicant the right \nto continue the process also stated he was scheduled for a psychological evaluation.  \n \n \nIn May 2003, when Applicant was informed he was authorized to continue his \nattempt to obtain SCI, he underwent a fourth polygraph.2 (Tr. 56, 67) Applicant withdrew \nhis application for SCI access because he \u201cwas tired of going through it.\u201d (Tr. 56, 114) \nApplicant was already doing work which did not require an SCI clearance. (Tr, 42, 56) \nHe was debriefed because there was no need for further action. \n \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions, Standard Form (SF) 86. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 26 which asked \nif his clearance or access authorization had been denied, suspended, or revoked. \nApplicant asserts his answer was due to having received poor advice. In June 2006, \nbefore completing his SF 86, Applicant sought the assistance of the manager for the \nSpecial Security Office, who later became the company\u2019s Director of Corporate Special \nSecurity (now retired). (Tr. 51) On June 29, 2006, the Director sent Applicant an email \nstating \n \nBased on this, although the [government agency] appeal was successful \nand you don\u2019t need to list the revocation on your paperwork for a PR, it \nprobably would be best to verbally advise the investigator of the \nrevocation and successful appeal since they already have knowledge that \nthere was an issue. That way, it appears you\u2019re being very honest \nconcerning the history of your clearance actions. (Ex. G) \n \n \n2 Applicant had additional polygraphs. His first polygraph was in 1992, prior to his first SCI access. (Tr. \n64, Ex. 3, pages 14) He had additionally polygraphs in 1997, September 200, October 2001, and \nNovember 2001. (Tr. 65, Ex. 3, page 13-14)  \n\n \n5 \n \nOn July 22, 2009, the Director, Corporate Special Security (retired) sent \nApplicant another email (Ex. F) in which she states: \n \n. . . the email I sent to you concerning your successful appeal thru \n[government agency]. I remember that my advice to you that it was not \nnecessary to include this event (the revocation and the successful appeal) \non future PSQ\u2019s was based on guidance I received from the [government \nagency] security representative at the time. As indicated, I further \nsuggested that you verbally advise the investigator of the details of this \nevent at the time of your personal interview. I see that you did that and it \nhas resulted in the Government indicating that you were untruthful on you \nSF86. \n \nI would like to make a statement to DOHA that if there is a discrepancy in \nthe paperwork it is due to the fact that [Applicant] was following the \nguidance of the Director of Special Security (now retired) and there was \nno intent to conceal this information. I worked with [Applicant] for many \nyears and he never was untruthful and always followed the guidance \nprovided by Special Security.  \n \n \nApplicant followed the guidance. (Tr. 118) When interviewed, Applicant stated he \nhad been denied SCI access, but had won the appeal and explained why he had \ncompleted his SF 86 as he had. (Tr. 60) Following the hearing, Applicant and his \ncompany attempted to determine his security status. (Ex. H). That status was not \navailable to him.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n6 \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern pertaining to sexual behavior: \n \nThe Concern: Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a \npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, \nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, \nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse \ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely \non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 expresses conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that the \nperson is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder; \n \n\n \n7 \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \n \n \n \nAt age 13, Applicant attempted sexual intercourse with his six-year-old sister. In \n1981, Applicant, then age 23, became sexual aroused when he took a bath with a 4-\nyear-old boy. In 1992, he became sexually aroused when his toddler daughter touched \nhis penis as he sat on the toilet. In 1994, Applicant touched his one-year-old son\u2019s penis \nwhen he was changing his son\u2019s diaper. In 1997, Applicant became sexually aroused \nwhile rubbing his daughter\u2019s buttocks. His daughter was between six and seven years \nold. At the hearing, he stated the \u201ctwinge\u201d was one of guilt, that he felt it was wrong he \nhad touched his daughter\u2019s buttocks. In 1997, these sexual incidents were known to the \ngovernment.  \n \n \nIn September 2000, Applicant reported he sometimes visualized his two or three \nyear old daughter\u2019s face while masturbating. He did not consciously try to focus on his \ndaughter\u2019s face and when he saw her face it lessened his arousal. In 2001, Applicant \nwas referred to the county Department of Juvenile Justice for evaluation. The report \nindicates Applicant\u2019s behavior was consistent with others who commit child sexual \nabuse. AG \u00b613(a) and \u00b6 13(d) apply.  \n \n \nThe government has been aware of the acts of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior or \nmisconduct since he revealed these acts in 2001. The government knew of the conduct \nin December 2002, when the agency\u2019s Access Appeals Panel found Applicant eligible to \ncontinue processing for access to SCI. Since that date, Applicant has not been involved \nin any additional sexual misconduct.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 expresses conditions that could mitigate the security concerns including:  \n \n(a) the behavior occurred during or prior to or during adolescence and \nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.  \n \n \nThe 2001 evaluation stated Applicant did not represent an immediate risk to his \nchildren and could benefit from outpatient treatment from a professional with training is \nsexual offense treatment. Once a week from February 2002 to July 2002, Applicant \n\n \n8 \nparticipated in family counseling. The counselor was trained in sexual offense \ntreatment. Applicant explained all the sexual conduct to his counselor. Weekly from \nAugust 2002 through June 2004, Applicant met with another doctor for the same \nproblem. His sessions continued for two years. Neither doctor found any concern about \nthe safety of Applicant\u2019s children. Counseling stopped when Applicant believed he had \nworked through all the issues that were of concern. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s conduct at age 13 related to his sister. Since \nthen, there was other sexual behavior of a questionable nature, but no evidence of \nsubsequent conduct related to his sister or underage individuals. The majority of the \nsexual conduct was known to the government in 1997. The most recent conduct \noccurred in 2000, when his daughter\u2019s face appeared in his mind while masturbating. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) applies. \n \n \nIn 1997, the government was aware of the majority of Applicant\u2019s adverse sexual \nconduct. The government became aware of the remaining conduct in 2000. He fully \nexplained his conduct to the county Department of Juvenile Justice evaluator in 2001. \nHe also told both of his counselors about his conduct while being counseled from \nFebruary 2002 through June 2004. Having explained his sexual conduct to these \nindividuals, Applicant has taken the positive step of disclosure, eliminating any \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 14(c) \u201cthe behavior no longer \nserves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply because the sexual behavior involved children and, \ntherefore, could not be found to be consensual.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n\n \n9 \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAs previously stated, the government was aware of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior \nor misconduct since 2001. Applicant has not been involved in any additional sexual \nmisconduct since the agency\u2019s Access Appeals Panel allowed him to continue \nprocessing for access to SCI. The only conduct the appeal panel was unaware of when \nthey made their decision was Applicant\u2019s response to his August 2006 SF 86 related to \nhis access being denied, suspended, or revoked. The appeal panel knew Applicant\u2019s \naccess had been denied because that was the very issue they considered in the appeal. \nThey could not have known of Applicant\u2019s SF 86 answer because it occurred three and \na half years later. It is this conduct that will be evaluated under the personal conduct \nconcern.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nOn his SF 86, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question which asked if he had \never had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked. In 2002, \nApplicant\u2019s SCI access was denied. I find & 16 (a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant appealed the denial of SCI access. In December 2002, Applicant was \nallowed to continue processing his request for access. Applicant\u2019s understanding of the \nletter meant the original decision denying his SCI access had been overturned. The \nletter stated Applicant was allowed to continue the process. Applicant had a new job not \nrequiring an SCI clearance so he withdrew his application for SCI access.  \n \n \nBefore completing his SF 86, Applicant sought the assistance of the manager for \nthe Special Security Office, who later became the company\u2019s Director of Corporate \nSpecial Security. The Director had checked with the agency\u2019s security representative \nand it was her advice that it was not necessary to include the denial of his SCI, which \nwas later appealed, on future PSQ\u2019s. She believed Applicant had won his appeal. (Tr. \n118) She specifically stated Applicant did not need to list the revocation on paperwork, \nbut should verbally inform any investigator of the revocation and details of this event at \nany personal interview. Applicant followed the guidance and, when interviewed, stated \nhe had been denied SCI access, but had won the appeal and explained why he had \ncompleted his SF 86 has he had. I find Applicant did not deliberately falsify his answer \nto question 26 of his SF 86. \n \n\n \n10 \nUnder the Directive, an applicant may mitigate the security concerns arising from \nquestionable personal conduct under certain circumstances. AG \u00b6 17 provides \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \nI find AG \u00b617(b) applies. Applicant followed the instructions of the Director of \nCorporate Special Security when answering his SF 86. He did not list this SCI access \nas having been denied because he was told it was not necessary to include that \ninformation on any PSQ. His omission or concealment was the result of improper or \ninadequate advice of an authorized personnel instructing specifically concerning the \nsecurity clearance process.  \n \nWith respect to the sexual behavior, the pertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \n\u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal \nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if \nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \nCertainly, Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior is conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it \nadversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. The government \nwas aware of all this behavior before allowing him to continue processing for SCI. \n \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d \napplies to Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior. Applicant has taken the positive step of \ndisclosure, eliminating any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Any \npersonal conduct security concerns related to Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior have already \nbeen addressed and need not be repeated here. The Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior does \nnot raise a personal conduct security concern.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n11 \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior was of \nconcern and he was evaluated. Applicant was told what to do and he followed that \nadvice. Following his evaluation, he sought and received treatment for the problem, and \nhe is not a risk to his children or other children.  \n \n \nThe government has been aware of the acts of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior or \nmisconduct since he revealed these acts in 2001. In December 2002, the agency\u2019s \nAccess Appeals Panel found Applicant eligible to continue processing for access to SCI. \nSince that date, Applicant has not been involved in any additional sexual misconduct. \nThe only additional new conduct to be considered since that date resulted from \nApplicant following his security official\u2019s advice in completing his SF 86.  \n \nDuring polygraph evaluations, Applicant described adverse and unusual sexual \nbehavior related to his sister, daughter, son, and a bath with four-year-old boy. The \nconduct is unusual and disturbing. His conduct was of the type that required review by \nsomeone qualified to properly evaluation that type of sexual behavior. The December \n2002 appeal indicated Applicant was to undergo a psychological evaluation. The \nevaluator concluded his behavior was consistent with others who commit child sexual \nabuse, but that Applicant was not a risk to his children.  \n \nThe LCPC found Applicant had the capacity and motivation to benefit from \ntreatment and recommended Applicant could benefit from outpatient treatment from a \nprofessional with training in sexual offense treatment. Applicant followed the LCPC\u2019s \nadvice and attended weekly counseling for four years. Applicant was cooperative, \nengaged in his therapy, and did not withholding any information from his therapists. \nNeither of his doctor found any concern about the safety of Applicant\u2019s children. \nCounseling stopped when Applicant believed he had worked through all the issues that \nwere of concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual behavior and \npersonal conduct.  \n \n \n\n \n12 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Sexual Behavior: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on July 20, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                \nOn April 27, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on June 7, 2009, in which he admitted two \nallegations and denied six allegations under Guideline E. Applicant requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nAugust 3, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on August 13, 2009. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on September 14, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nOctober 14, 2009. The government offered six exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and did not present other witness testimony. He also offered three exhibits, \nmarked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \nThe record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. However, on October 15, 2009, \nApplicant moved to re-open the record to admit an additional character reference. I \nopened the record and added it to Applicant's character references exhibit, AE B. The \nrecord closed on October 15, 2009. DOHA received the transcript on October 20, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are accepted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, \nand the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in business. He also \ncompleted coursework toward a master\u2019s degree (AE C; Tr. 21). Applicant worked in the \ncomputer field in the late 1980s. From 1988 to 2001, he worked as a stunt double and \nbody double for a movie actor (AE C). In about 1995, he began working in training films \nfor a federal government agency (agency A) (Tr. 23-26). He received his first security \nclearance through agency A in approximately 1998 (Tr. 92). From 2001 to the present, \nhe has continued to work in information technology. As of November 2008, he held the \nposition of client sales executive for a defense contractor (GE 3). Applicant has never \nbeen married, but has been in a committed relationship since the mid-1990s. He has a \nnine-year-old daughter from this relationship (Tr. 26-27). \n \nFrom June to August 2001, Applicant was employed by company B as a senior \nnetwork engineer. Company B was a subcontractor to defense contractor C. Applicant \nworked on-site at defense contractor C\u2019s location, where he reported to a defense \ncontractor C manager. Company B instructed Applicant to report on his timesheet the \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3 \n                                                \nactual hours worked on a certain defense contract. On August 9, 2001, an email to \ncompany B employees reiterated that all hours worked were required to be reported on \ntimesheets. Applicant testified that he worked many overtime hours, but did not report \nthem because he was told by his defense contractor C manager that he was not \nauthorized to work overtime, and he would be terminated if he reported the extra hours. \nCompany B told him that his on-site defense contractor manager was not the person \nauthorized to pay for overtime hours (Tr. 54-55). Applicant testified that company B was \nbeing paid for overtime hours reported by other employees (Tr. 54). In August 2001, he \nwas terminated by company B for falsifying his time cards. The company B president \ndescribed Applicant as \u201ctechnically competent, ambitious, confident, arrogant and \ndeceitful.\u201d The company B facility security assistant found Applicant to be high-strung \nbut goal-oriented and competent. She could not recommend him, however, because of \n\u201cSubject\u2019s actions when he worked for [company B].\u201d Applicant testified that company B \nwas later released from the contract, but that he was retained by defense contractor C. \nHe disclosed the termination on his 2001 and 2007 security clearance applications (GE \n1, 2, 6; AE C; Tr. 50-51, 54-56). \n \nAfter starting with a new employer in September 2001, Applicant completed an \napplication for a secret clearance through the Department of Defense in December \n2001 (GE 2). In response to question #27, concerning drug use in the previous seven \nyears (1994\u20132001), he disclosed that he used marijuana during the month of July 1995, \nalthough he did not know the number of times (GE 2). During a follow-up interview with \nan agent of the Defense Security Service in May 2003, Applicant stated that he used \nmarijuana \u201cduring my early teens and during college as well as I had some occasional \nuse at parties up until 1995. I stopped using \u2018pot\u2019 after this time and I have no intention \nof using it in the future.\u201d (GE 5).   \n \nApplicant held a secret security clearance in the late 1990s when he performed \nin training films for government agency A (Tr. 53). Agency A requested that Applicant \napply to upgrade his clearance to top secret (GE 1; Tr. 27).3 During the security \ninterview in July 2003, Applicant reported that he had not used marijuana since 1995, \nwhen he used it twice at parties (AE C). His co-workers, who were interviewed as part \nof this investigation, described applicant as stable, focused, and professional. None \nstated that they were aware of any illegal drug use by Applicant (GE 3).  \n \n \n3 The evidence indicates that two investigations were ongoing simultaneously. One was initiated by \nagency A to upgrade Applicant's clearance to top secret. He completed a security clearance application \nin April 2003, and agency A interviewed Applicant and administered two polygraph examinations \nbetween 2003 and 2004, Based on the results of the July 2004 polygraph interview, agency A revoked \nApplicant's security clearance and issued an SOR in October 2004. Applicant appealed the decision, \nand a hearing was set for January 2007, but was not held. An investigation for a Department of Defense \n(DoD) secret security clearance was initiated with the December 2001 security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed by a DoD agent in May 2003. He received a security clearance that year. He \nlearned in 2007 that this security clearance was revoked. He testified that he did not know the reason, \nand he re-applied for a security clearance in July 2007 (GE 1). \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                \nApplicant testified that he completed two polygraph examinations as part of the \nagency A investigation (Tr. 28). The interviewer who administered the second polygraph \nin July 2004 focused on the use of illegal drugs. According to the agency A SOR4 the \nApplicant stated during the polygraph interview that he: \n \n\u2022 \nUsed marijuana from his early teens to May 2004 \n \n\u2022 \nSmoked marijuana daily in the late 1980s but quit using it in 1995 \n \n\u2022 \nSmoked sporadically from 1997 until he again quit in 2001 \n \n\u2022 \nResumed smoking in 2002 \n \n\u2022 \nSmoked marijuana 12 to 15 times between June 2002 and June 2004 \n \n\u2022 \nWas concerned about work-related drug testing as he had held a security \nclearance during these periods  \n \n\u2022 \nWould find it difficult to follow an employer\u2019s drug-free policy because it \nwould entail avoiding family and friends who used marijuana \n \n\u2022 \nGave his brother $100 to buy marijuana, which Applicant stored in his \nhome to share with family and friends (GE 3). \n \nApplicant denies making these statements during the polygraph interview (Tr. 60-63). \nHowever, the interviewer concluded that Applicant had provided false information about \nhis drug use on his April 2003 security clearance application and in his July 2003 \nsecurity interview (GE 3; Tr. 41-42). The agency issued an SOR in July 2004, citing \nconcerns about Applicant's illegal drug use and personal conduct, and revoked \nApplicant's security clearance in October 2004.  \n \n \nIn his response to the agency A SOR, Applicant stated that a misunderstanding \noccurred during the polygraph interview. Applicant testified that the interviewer asked \nhim to share negative information of which the agency was not aware. He denied having \nany such information to share. The interviewer rephrased it as a hypothetical: If a \nforeign country were to blackmail him, what negative information about Applicant could \nthe country provide to the agency? He said that in such a scenario, the foreign country \ncould disclose that he had used marijuana in the past (GE 3; Tr. 41-43). Applicant \ntestified,  \n \n \n4 Agency A\u2019s SOR (GE 3) describes Applicant's statements made during the July 2004 polygraph \ninterview. It was admitted without objection. Such documents are admissible under Federal Rules of \nEvidence 803(b) \u201cto present evidence about the findings and conclusions reached by a government \nentity,\u201d and they should be considered as substantial evidence (ISCR Case No. 02-12299 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. Aug 8, 2005).  \n\n \n \n5 \nAPPLICANT: \u2026But then she said, \u201cDid you smoke recently,\u201d or \u201cmore \nrecently?\u201d or something of that matter, and I said, \u201cThey could say I did.  \nI did not, but they could say I did.\u201d  \n \n(Applicant then testified that the agent asked, \u201cWell, why could they say you \ndid?\u201d) \n \nAPPLICANT: And then we got into this whole discussion around I \nattended parties and there were some family events where smoking of \nmarijuana does go on. And -- but I was very clear there's a difference \nbetween smoking of marijuana going on and me smoking. And then we \ngot into a whole discussion of, well, how many times were these events \nand I was honest -- and I still can't tell you how many parties these were \n-- there were. (Tr. 42-44) \n \nApplicant then told the agent that the family events occurred approximately once or \ntwice per year, and that his family members were not consistent drug users. Applicant's \ncounsel asked if Applicant and the agent discussed his own drug use at these events: \n \nAPPLICANT: I -- it never -- she never asked.  I'm clear that I didn't, but \nshe never -- that was never a question that was placed on the table. \n \nMR. EISEN: And so what were you talking about, secondhand smoke?  \n   \nAPPLICANT: At that time I was -- I was talking about secondhand \nsmoke, and I don't know if you remember the Nineties, but especially \nwhen someone quits, they blow a lot near or at you or make fun of you.  \nSo, it was all secondhand smoke (Tr. 45-46). \n \nIt appears from Applicant\u2019s testimony that during his interview he was concerned that \nassociating with persons who were using marijuana at family parties and inhaling \nsecond-hand smoke might be illegal, or interpreted as illegal drug use on his part (Tr. \n46-47). \n \n \nThe agency\u2019s SOR alleged that Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions on a \n2003 security clearance application relating to his illegal drug use, and his use while \nholding a security clearance. Applicant testified that he was upset and irate when he \nread the SOR (Tr. 28). In his response to the agency\u2019s SOR, he stated,  \n \nI believe the interviewer miss-understood [sic] my statements during the \nreview and/or the [sic] recorded some things incorrectly out of context. I \nbelieve that these miss-perceptions or errors have lead to a belief that I \nam un-trust worthy, dishonest and that I lack condor. I contend that all of \nthese perceptions are incorrect.\u2026Regarding the drug use, please note \nthat I contend that this too is a part of what was incorrectly documented \n\n \n \n6 \nwithin the context of my discussions. I also have always expressed a \nwillingness to under-go a drug test and I expressed that I have \nsuccessfully taken drug tests. \n \nHe requested a hearing and in December 2004, the agency informed him that he would \nbe notified when a hearing would be held (GE 3).  \n \n \nIn November 2006, agency A notified Applicant that his hearing would take \nplace on December 13 at 9:00 a.m. The day before the hearing, Applicant asked that it \nbe re-scheduled to January 3 or 4, 2007. The hearing was re-set for January 4, 2007 at \n9:00 a.m. He was contacted to confirm notice of the hearing, but he did not return the \ncalls. Agency A\u2019s letter dated January 9, 2007 informed him that if he did not contact \nthe agency, his appeal would be cancelled. Applicant did not respond, and the hearing \ndid not take place. In March 2008, he told a DoD investigator that the appeal was not \ngranted in a timely manner. In November 2008, Applicant stated that he could not \nrespond timely because of work commitments (GE 3).  \n \n \nAt the October 2009 hearing, he denied that a hearing date was scheduled at \nall. He denied that he failed to appear at the agency hearing, stating, \u201cIt wasn't a no-\nshow, so I should be clear with that. It was not a case that I did not show up. It was a \ncase that I said I was not going to have it. I did not do a no-show.\u201d (Tr. 106). When \nasked why he would say that, when he had submitted documents showing a scheduled \nhearing, he testified, \u201c\u2026We talked about one, but we did not schedule it.  So -- but I -- \nso, I don't know.\u201d (GE 3; Tr. 73-74). According to his testimony, agency A called him in \nlate 2006 and asked if he wished to continue the security clearance process. He told \nthe agent he did not wish to continue the process with agency A. He testified that he \ndid not understand that loss of the agency clearance could affect his DoD clearance, \nand that if he had known, he would have attended the agency hearing (Tr. 30-33). \n \n \nIn his March 2008 statement to a DoD investigator, Applicant did not disclose \nthat his security clearance had been revoked because of illegal drug use. He wrote, \u201cI \nstate that I had a [agency] clearance (top secret) revoked in 2004. I could not recall the \nreasons.\u201d (GE 4). When asked at the hearing if he forgot why agency A revoked his \nclearance, Applicant testified, \n \nAPPLICANT: \u201cI would say \"forget\" as in \"I don't know what happened,\" or \n\"forget\" as in -- as in -- what?  I mean, the [agency] revoked my \nclearance because I didn't go on an interview, was my understanding.\u201d \n(Tr. 69).  \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant's DoD security clearance was revoked. He testified that \nan SOR was not issued, and neither he nor his security officer knew why it was \nrevoked. He submitted a new security clearance application. He listed the revocation of \ntwo security clearances, stating that he lost his security clearance because he \u201cFailed \nto pass Polygraph Test and thus failed to recieve [sic] upgrade to Top Secret \n\n \n \n7 \n                                                \nClearance.\u201d (GE 1). In response to questions concerning illegal drug use within the \nprevious seven years, and illegal drug use while holding a security clearance, Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions (GE 1, 3; Tr. 72-73). \n \n \nApplicant submitted several character references (AE B). A family friend, who \nhas known Applicant for 12 years, stated that he is honest and trustworthy. She \nnominated him for the board of directors of an educational organization because he is a \nstrong role model. Two former Navy officers, who currently manage accounts that \nApplicant supports, have known him for several years and are familiar with his work \nperformance. One noted that Applicant is a man of integrity who is committed to \nsupporting the military. The other manager commented on Applicant's honesty, \ntrustworthiness and patriotism, and noted that granting his clearance would enhance \nmission effectiveness. A Navy lieutenant commander who has known Applicant for four \nto five years commented that Applicant is a strong and hardworking leader on work \nprojects and is a man of integrity. Applicant's girlfriend, with whom he has lived since \nthe mid-1990s, is a doctor of optometry. She related that Applicant is dedicated to his \nfamily, coaches their daughter\u2019s soccer team, stresses healthy living, and would not \nengage in drug use. She noted that Applicant is highly respected in his neighborhood, \nand served on his community association board of directors and as its president.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.5 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the \nGuidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government \n \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n \n8 \n                                                \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n9 \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of:\u2026(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations \n \nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified answers regarding \nhis illegal drug use on security clearance applications in 2001 and 2007; and in written \nstatements submitted to government investigators in May 2003 and March 2008. His \ndrug use was disclosed during his polygraph interview in 2004, when he provided \ndetails showing that his marijuana use ended not in 1995, but in 2004. He provided \nspecifics of his frequency and pattern of marijuana usage: the dates when he used it \non a daily basis, when he stopped using it, when he resumed usage, when he used it \nsporadically, and the number of times he used in between 2002 and 2004. He also \ndisclosed that he gave his brother money for marijuana, that he used marijuana while \nholding a security clearance, and discussed the difficulties presented by being \nemployed in a drug-free workplace. Applicant denies making these statements during \nthe interview. He claims that the interviewer posed a hypothetical scenario, and his \nsubsequent responses to it were misunderstood. However, his explanation was not \ncredible. His testimony about the hypothetical, about the illegality of associating with \ndrug users, and about second-hand smoke was ambiguous, unclear, and does not \nexplain the relation between the hypothetical and the numerous specifics he provided \nabout his drug use. I find that the detailed disclosures during the polygraph interview \nare an accurate representation of the dates, times, frequency and circumstances of \nApplicant's illegal drug use, and that his statements on his security clearance \napplications and in his other interviews were falsifications. \n \nSeveral other statements made by Applicant are not credible.  \n \n\u2022 \nHe provided contradictory information about the hearing with \nagency A. He testified that a hearing was never scheduled when, in \nfact, GE 3 shows that a hearing was not only scheduled once, but \nwas rescheduled a second time at Applicant's own request. He \ntestified that he \u201cwas not a no-show\u201d at the hearing, in spite of the \nfact that his documents show he did not appear at the hearing.  \n \n\u2022 \nIn his 2001 security clearance application, he stated that he used \nmarijuana in the month of July 1995. However, in 2003 he said that \nhe used it in his teens and at college (which were both outside the \nscope of the pertinent question), but also occasionally at parties up \nuntil 1995. This indicates he used marijuana more often than one \nmonth in 1995.  \n \n\u2022 \nApplicant stated that he was irate and upset when he received the \nagency A SOR. Given his anger, and the threat this SOR caused to \n\n \n \n10 \nhis career, it is difficult to understand why he did not state, \nanywhere in his response, that the drug-use allegations were \nuntrue; instead, he equivocated by saying his statements were \nmisunderstood and misperceived.  \n \n\u2022 \nApplicant's 2008 statement that he could not remember why he \nreceived the agency A SOR is not credible, given the SOR\u2019s \nsignificance, and the anger he said it provoked.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is relevant to Applicant's employment termination. Applicant failed to \nreport on his time-card the actual hours he worked, and testified that he could not \nsatisfy the reporting requirements of both company A and defense contractor B. He \nchose to ignore the requirements of his employer, company A. However, other company \nA employees did report their overtime hours. There is no record evidence or testimony \nthat they were reprimanded or terminated for doing so, and there is testimony that they \nwere paid for those hours. The fact that the defense contractor may have released \ncompany A from the contract, and retained Applicant, does not mitigate the fact that \nApplicant falsified his time cards by not reporting his true work hours. His decision to \ndisregard his employer\u2019s repeated instructions reflects poorly on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness and willingness to comply with rules. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions are relevant: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant's falsifications are unmitigated. The record contains no evidence that \nApplicant attempted to correct his security clearance applications, or his statements in \nhis security interviews, regarding his use of illegal drugs after 1995. His illegal conduct \ndid not come to light until 2004, during his second security interview with agency A. \nAlthough his falsifications in 2001 and 2003 are not recent, his falsification in a 2008 \ninterview occurred less than two years ago. Moreover, his conduct cannot be \nconsidered minor. He falsified information provided to the government numerous times. \nSuch actions undermine the security clearance process and raise serious doubts about \nApplicant's reliability and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) cannot be applied. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant provided specifics of his drug use after 1995 during his interview with \nagency A, but later denied that these detailed admissions were true. His last \nfalsification occurred in 2008, when he was a mature adult 44 years of age. Moreover, \nalthough drug use was not alleged and is not outcome-determinative, it does go to the \nassessment of the whole person. Applicant's willingness to engage in criminal conduct \nby using illegal drugs as a mature adult, and while holding a security clearance, \nundermines his trustworthiness. Applicant described a hypothetical scenario posed by \nthe interviewer, without providing a rational connection between that scenario and the \ndetailed information he provided about his marijuana use. He falsified other \ninformation, including time-card information, for which he as terminated, and his \ntestimony about the agency A hearing, which directly contradicted his own documents.  \n \n \nOverall, Applicant's falsifications raise serious doubts about his suitability for \naccess to classified information. The record evidence fails to satisfy these doubts, \nwhich must be resolved in favor of the national security. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the cited \nadjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n\n \n \n12 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 16, 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nDecember 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective within DOD on September 1, 2006. \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nJune 4, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for him, and it recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. \n \nOn December 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 26, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 18, 2010, scheduling a \nhearing for February 24, 2010. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented one witnesses, and \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 4, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nIn late January 2010, Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel agreed to \nschedule Applicant\u2019s hearing on February 24, 2010. The Notice of Hearing was issued \nfour days before the hearing date. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15-day \nadvance written notice. (Tr. 9, Appellate Ext. 1). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant made a partial, qualified admission of the factual allegations under \nSOR \u00b6 1.a,1 and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b. His admissions are incorporated here as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old mission support lead manager for software \ndevelopment working for a defense contractor. He graduated from college in 1996, and \nreceived a Bachelor of Arts degree in management information systems. He is single \nand has no children. He has known his girlfriend for six years and they are engaged to \nbe married. \n \nApplicant has been working since January 1997, mostly for defense contractors \nproviding support to government agencies, except for 1999 to 2003, when he worked for \nindustry. He held access to classified information from 1997 until 1999, and from 2003 \nuntil sometime in 2007-2008 when his clearance was suspended. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer providing support to a government agency since January 2007.  \n \nAs a teenager (age 15-16), Applicant worked at a retail store. When the store \nmanager was out, he would allow his friends to take merchandise without paying for it. \nWhen his friends were working at a different store, Applicant would do the same and \n \n1 Applicant admitted he told a government investigator he smoked marijuana once in 2004. However, he \ntestified he lied to the investigator to end the interview. The last time he illegally used marijuana was in \n1992. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nsteal merchandise while the store manager was out. He estimated he stole around \n$7,000-$8,000.  \n \nApplicant illegally smoked marijuana while in high school and during college. He \ndescribed his use of marijuana as infrequent, and claimed his last use of marijuana was \nin November 1992, at age 19. He testified that while attending college, he came to the \nrealization that marijuana was not for him. He knew that at some point, he would work \nfor the government and he did not want to adversely affect his eligibility for a \ngovernment job. \n \nIn March 2002, Applicant was charged with possession of fake identification and \nalcohol. He underwent a diversion program, was placed on probation, his license was \nsuspended for one year, participated in alcohol counseling, and performed community \nwork. His record was expunged after he completed his probation. \n \nFrom approximately 1996 to 1999 and in 2004, Applicant accessed inappropriate \nwebsites approximately 100 times from a government computer. He knew it was \nimproper for him to access those websites from a government computer. He claimed his \nfriends used to send him emails with links to pornographic sites or attachments that he \nopened and then deleted. He claimed he was na\u00efve and immature and did not fully \nunderstood the ramifications of his actions. He has not accessed any inappropriate \nwebsites on a government computer since 2006, except during the performance of his \nduties as a network access manager. \n \nBetween an unspecified date and August 2005, Applicant rented and made \nillegal copies of approximately 150 DVD movies. He claimed he stopped making illegal \ncopies of movies in August 2005.2 \n \nIn September-October 2005, Applicant participated in a lifecycle polygraph \nassisted interview. Before the interview, he disclosed he shoplifted as a teenager, \nillegally smoked marijuana while in high school and college (the last time was in \nNovember 1992), that he illegally made copies of movies, and that he was suspended \nduring his first year of college for academic reasons. He told the investigator that the \nlast time he believed he was around marijuana was in May 2004. He explained that \nduring a party, a girlfriend was smoking a European made cigarette and he took a drag \nof her cigarette. He believed he recognized the smell and taste of marijuana and asked \nher whether she was smoking a marijuana cigarette. She told him that the cigarette did \nnot contain marijuana. \n \n \n2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant made illegal copies of DVDs or that he lied to a government \ninvestigator during a polygraph assisted background interview. As such, this information cannot be used \nto deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Notwithstanding, I may consider any behavior not alleged in the \nSOR to: assess his credibility; evaluate his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; assess his possible rehabilitation; determine the applicability of the AGs; and conduct the \nwhole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDuring the course of an approximately three-hour interview, the interviewer \nrepeatedly confronted and questioned Applicant about his marijuana use until Applicant \nadmitted he smoked marijuana in May 2004. At his hearing, Applicant repeatedly \ntestified he has not used marijuana since November 1992. He claimed that after almost \nthree hours of being badgered by the interviewer, he was tired and mentally exhausted \nand falsely admitted to using marijuana. Applicant admitted he lied to the interviewer \nabout his use of marijuana in 2004, because he wanted to stop the interview and go \nhome. As a result of his marijuana use admission, Applicant was denied access to \nclassified information at the top secret level and his clearance was suspended. \nApplicant testified that he is against the use of illegal drugs, he does not associate with \ndrug-users, and avoids visiting places where drugs may be used. \n \nApplicant presented a sworn statement from his May 2004 girlfriend \ncorroborating that he asked for a drag of her cigarette and that she was not smoking \nmarijuana. She stated she has never seen or heard of Applicant using marijuana. To \nher knowledge Applicant is against the use of illegal drugs. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 also \nprovided a sworn statement indicating she has known him since 2004. She has never \nseen or heard of Applicant using marijuana during the last 10 years. Applicant is against \nthe use of illegal drugs and avoids interacting with people who do.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified at his hearing. He has been employed by a \ngovernment contractor for eight years. He is responsible for the industrial security and \nthe network security of a government agency. He has known Applicant for seven years \nduring which they have had close daily contact. During the last three years, Applicant \nhas worked directly under his supervision. The supervisor confirmed Applicant worked \nas firewall administrator between 2003 and 2006. In that capacity, Applicant likely \naccessed inappropriate websites as part of his duties blocking access to those \nwebsites. \n \nWhen Applicant informed him of the SOR allegations, he reviewed the last five \nyears of firewall logs to determine whether Applicant had been accessing inappropriate \nwebsites. He determined that Applicant was not accessing inappropriate websites \noutside of his official duties to block such sites. Applicant is his go-to man. Applicant \nmanages a 25 man team as a network security monitor and runs the program \ndevelopment organization. He considers Applicant to be honest, trustworthy, and of high \nmoral character. Applicant is a bright and valuable employee that demonstrates good \njudgment. He has had a clearance for seven years and never has had any security \nissues. Applicant is knowledgeable of, and follows the rules and regulations for, \nhandling secured information. He recommended Applicant\u2019s continued access to \nclassified information. Applicant has a reputation for being opposed to drug use. \n \nApplicant\u2019s company facility security officer provided a sworn statement. He has \nknown Applicant since 1996. During this period, they have had daily to weekly contact. \nHe considers Applicant extremely diligent in following security rules and procedures. He \nconsiders Applicant to be dependable, honest, and trustworthy. He believes Applicant \nhas a reputation for being against drug use. He has never received a complaint about \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant accessing inappropriate websites. He recommended Applicant\u2019s continued \naccess to classified information. \n \nThe government agency\u2019s industrial security manager also provided a sworn \nstatement on behalf of Applicant. He has known and has interacted with Applicant on a \ndaily basis since 2003. He believes Applicant has strong ethics and character. He \nconsiders Applicant to be dependable, honest, and trustworthy. Applicant has a \nreputation for following rules and procedures and has never been involved in any \nsecurity violations. Applicant made him aware of the SOR allegations. Notwithstanding, \nApplicant has his complete confidence and he endorsed Applicant\u2019s continued access \nto classified information. He has never received any complaints about Applicant\u2019s \nperformance. He believes Applicant is against the illegal use of drugs. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met the strict \n\n \n6 \n \n \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant shoplifted as a teenager. He used marijuana while in high school and \nduring his first year of college. He last used marijuana in 1992. He deliberately provided \na false statement to a government investigator when he falsely stated he had used \nmarijuana in 2004. As a result of his false statement, his clearance was suspended. \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n16(b): \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant fact to \nan employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official \ngovernment representative;\u201d AG \u00b6 16(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several \nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any \nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \n\n \n7 \n \n \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations;\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, \nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), \n17(e), and 17(g) all apply, at least in part, to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s shoplifting \noccurred when he was a teenager in high school. There is no evidence that he has \nbeen involved in similar activity since, or that he has continued his association with his \nshoplifting friends.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant illegally used marijuana while in high school and during his first year of \ncollege. He stopped using marijuana in 1992. He has closely worked with three different \nsupervisors for approximately seven years. He disclosed and discussed the SOR \nallegations with his supervisors. All of his supervisors lauded Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nability to follow rules and regulations, and his dependability, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness. They consider Applicant to be opposed to the use of drugs and \nrecommended Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior constituted serious offenses. Notwithstanding, the \nseriousness of his actions, I find his behavior to be remote and that it occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. His shoplifting occurred when he was a \nteenager and his illegal marijuana use stopped in 1992. He has worked for a \ngovernment contractor during the last seven years. His performance and character are \nconsidered beyond reproach. His thee supervisors lauded his professionalism and his \nability to follow rules and regulations.  \n \nApplicant established through his supervisor that his access to the inappropriate \nwebsites during the last five years was likely related to his duties as a firewall \nadministrator. It appears the investigator did not consider necessary to follow up on \nApplicant\u2019s statement that it was part of his duties to access inappropriate websites to \nblock them from access from others. Thus, it is plausible the investigator was \noverzealous on his investigation, refused to believe that Applicant stopped using \nmarijuana in 1992, and pushed Applicant to his limit. It is possible Applicant lied to \nterminate his interview. \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s false statement to a background investigator, regardless of \nthe investigator\u2019s overzealousness is a serious concern. At the time of his background \ninterview, he was a mature, well educated, capable worker. Lying to an investigator just \nto end the interview shows a clear lack of judgment. On the other hand, the statement \nwas made five years ago. Applicant is now more mature person, he is engaged to be \nmarried, and holds substantial professional responsibility. Applicant has acknowledged \nhis inappropriate behavior and expressed sincere remorse for his actions. He promised \nnever to make any false statements in the future. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9, supervisors, and \nemployer know about his inappropriate behavior. As such, he is not vulnerable to \nexploitation or duress.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. Except for the misconduct discussed in the decision, there is no \nevidence of any other blemishes on Applicant\u2019s behavior, or that he has otherwise failed \nto follow rules and regulations, or violated security procedures.  \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his inappropriate behavior and expressed sincere \nremorse for his actions. He promised never to make any false statements in the future. \nHe has substantially reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation or duress. \nSince 1997, he has been successful working for defense contractors, and has \nestablished a reputation as a valuable, dedicated, and reliable employee. His \nreferences consider Applicant to be honest, trustworthy, and of high moral character. He \nwas commended for his judgment, maturity, work ethic, and overall performance. His \nreferences recommended that he receive access to classified information. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant deliberately made a false statement to an \ninvestigator despite his knowledge of the illegality of his action. His false statement is a \nserious offense. It squarely brings up the issue of whether Applicant is a security risk \nbased on his past behavior.  \n \nOn balance, and after considering all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \npersonal conduct. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence of good performance for a \ngovernment contractor outweighs his temporally remote questionable behavior. I believe \nhe has learned from his mistakes and the security clearance process. He now \nunderstands what is required of him to maintain his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Overall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP), on January 21, 2008. On November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOn November 20, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n8, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2009. On February 6, 2009, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for March 4, 2009. The case was \nheard on that date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. Applicant testified and offered 34 exhibits which were \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 HH. Appellant and her husband testified. The \nApril 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ntranscript was received on March 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old budget assistant employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance.  She has worked for this company \nsince December 2007.  In 2006, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business \nadministration. She previously worked as a budget analyst at a local military command, \nretiring after 24 years of service. She held a SECRET security clearance during her \nentire civil service career. She is married and has five adult children and one adult \nstepson. (Tr at 7-12; Gov 1)  \n \nOn January 21, 2008, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1) In \nresponse to section 28, she listed three properties that are in the process of foreclosure. \n(Gov 1) All three mortgages are located in other parts of the country far from where \nApplicant lives. One mortgage is in the amount of $247,000 and is delinquent in the \namount of $37,948. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1, section 28; Gov 2; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 6; AE F \nat 2; AE I; AE R; AE BB) One mortgage is in the amount of $249,000 and is in \nforeclosure. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 1, section 28; Gov 2; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 12; AE F at 2; \nAE I; AE BB) Another delinquent mortgage is for $261,000 and is over 120 days \ndelinquent. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 1, section 28; Gov 2; Gov 5 at 11; AE F at 1; AE I; AE BB)   \n \nCredit reports obtained during her background investigation revealed the three \nmortgage foreclosures and indicated that Applicant and her husband had filed for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy on October 1, 1998. (Gov 4; Gov 5) \n \nApplicant and her husband filed for bankruptcy due to Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s \nunsuccessful property management and remodeling business. In 1996, Applicant quit \nher civil service job at the military command in order to help her husband with the \nbusiness and to develop a real estate business. She is a licensed real estate agent. The \nbusiness did not do as well as anticipated. They did not have enough capital. In 1997, \nApplicant returned to her civil service job at the military command. Around the same \ntime, Applicant\u2019s husband hurt his back and was unable to work for several years. They \nattended credit counseling but decided they had no other option than to file for \nbankruptcy. Their debts were discharged on January 29, 1999. (Tr at 18-20; Gov 3; AE \nC; AE D; AE E) Their financial situation has been stable since the bankruptcy discharge.   \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant was surfing the Internet for business opportunities. \nShe discovered a web-site titled \u201c30KPERYEAR.COM\u201d advertising the opportunity to \nmake $30,000 per year. The web-site advertised \u201cWe do all the work, you get paid!\u201d The \nweb-site also claimed that potential participants help save families\u2019 home-ownership \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand partner with established financial companies. All that was required was for the \nparticipant to sign paperwork. (Tr at 31; AE M)  \n \nApplicant understood that the company, 30KPERYEAR.COM purchased \ndistressed properties prior to foreclosure. The agreement was that a straw buyer \n(Applicant) would provide their credit information and identity and the company would \npurchase the property in the straw buyer\u2019s name. The property would go into a trust \nholding company for a year to allow the original owners to repair their credit in order to \nqualify for additional financing. The original owners would stay in the property and pay \nrent. The trust holding company would collect the rent, pay the mortgage, including \ninsurance and taxes. The straw buyer would profit from the arrangement by receiving \n$5,000 per property upon the transfer of the property to the trustee. The agreement was \nfor six properties per year totaling $30,000 per year. In the summer of 2006, Applicant \nsigned a contract to purchase three properties over a period of two months. (Gov 2) \nApplicant did not pay any money in conjunction with these agreements. She was \nessentially allowing the company to use her identity and good credit rating to obtain \nmortgages in her name. Pursuant to the agreement, Applicant received $5,000 for one \nof the homes. She did not receive the other $10,000 that was owed to her for the other \ntwo homes. (Tr at 31-33, 68-70, 74; AE I at 8-12) \n \nBy the fall 2006, the FBI was investigating 30KPERYEAR.COM and the trust \nholding company for tax evasion and mortgage fraud. The scheme targeted \nhomeowners across the nation who had distressed mortgages with substantial equity in \nthe home who were unable to refinance due to their poor credit rating. Applicant \nunwittingly became involved in an \u201cequity stripping\u201d scheme which netted approximately \n$5.9 million in stolen equity from 68 homeowners in states across the nation. The \nmastermind of this scheme received 97% of the stolen equity. His \u201csales agents\u201d and \nemployees would receive the remaining 3% of equity or a salary from the fraudulently \nobtained funding. Straw buyers such as the Applicant were recruited over the Internet. \nThrough material misrepresentations and omissions, victim homeowners would be \noffered what appeared to be their last best chance to save their homes. (AE K at 2) \n \nThe company informed the homeowners that the straw buyers would act as \n\u201cinvestors.\u201d These \u201cinvestors\u201d would often replace the homeowners on the titles of the \nproperties without the homeowner\u2019s knowledge. Once the straw buyer had title to the \nhome, the company immediately applied for a mortgage to extract the maximum \navailable equity from the home. Company employees would share the proceeds of the \nill-gotten equity and \u201crent\u201d being paid by the victim homeowner. When the company \nultimately sold the home, stopped making the mortgage payments, and/or pursued an \neviction proceeding, the victim homeowner was left without their home, equity, or \nrepaired credit. The straw buyers were left with a mortgage or mortgage(s) that were \npending foreclosure. (AE K at 1)   \n \nOn March 13, 2008, a federal grand jury indicted seven employees of the \ncompany. Applicant had direct communication with several of the employees who were \nindicted. (Tr at 70; AE J; AE K) The person who she worked with the most sent a letter \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto all of the straw buyers indicating the status of the company pending indictment and \nhow it affects them. He recommended that the straw buyers seek legal and financial \nadvice from qualified, licensed professionals. (AE I)  \n \nApplicant found herself responsible for payment of the three mortgages because \nthe loans were in her name. When Applicant discovered that she was responsible for \nthe mortgages, she unsuccessfully attempted to collect rent from the individuals living in \nthe house, the former homeowners. She hired a realtor to assist her and consulted an \nattorney. Her attorney advised her that the transactions were illegal. Although a licensed \nreal estate agent, Applicant claims she did not have training in this area and was not \naware that it was illegal. (Tr at 35-36; 68, 69; AE V)  \n \nApplicant states that she made a bad choice and is very sorry that people were \nhurt in the process. She is upset that she is involved in something very wrong even \nthough she did not know it at the time. She should have been more cautious and less \ntrusting. Applicant is trying to work with each bank holding the mortgages to resolve the \nissue. She is hoping each bank will allow a deed in lieu foreclosure or a short sale. (Tr \nat 20-21, 35-36, 59-60, 68) \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified that his wife is an honest and trustworthy person. \nHe has been married to her for over 17 years. He stated that they tried their best to \navoid filing for bankruptcy but when he hurt his back and could not work they could not \nprevent it. He says that his wife would not do anything to hurt anyone and was \nscammed by the company when she entered into an agreement to purchase \nmortgages. She believed that she was earning money but was also helping distressed \nhomeowners to stay in their homes. (Tr at 71-76.) \n \nAside from the mortgages, Applicant and husband\u2019s financial situation is stable. \nTheir combine net monthly income, including Applicant\u2019s civil service retirement check is \n$6,000. Their total monthly bills are approximately $4,000.  They have $2,000 in \ndiscretionary income each month. (Tr at 62-67)  \n \nApplicant is highly thought of by her superiors, former superiors, and co-workers. \n(AE A) Her former supervisor, the Director of Operations of the military command, \nwhere Applicant retired from civil service met Applicant in August 1999. She was his \nsecretary/administrative assistant until she accepted a higher level position within the \ncommand budget office. Aware that she was a licensed realtor, he arranged for her to \nrepresent him in the sale of his home. He is impressed with the professional manner \nthat she carries out her responsibilities both in her full-time and part-time jobs.  After his \nretirement from the military, he accepted a job with the defense contractor Applicant \ncurrently works for. He recruited her to come work for them based on his knowledge of \nher duty performance, honesty, and integrity.  There is no one whom he has greater \nrespect for. (AE A at 1-2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor over the past year has known Applicant for \neight years. She states Applicant is extremely diligent and conscientious in her work \n\n \n5 \n \n \nethic. She trusts her with any information required to complete her assigned tasks. (AE \nA at 3.) Other friends and co-workers describe her as \u201chonest,\u201d \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d \n\u201cprofessional,\u201d and \u201chardworking\u201d among other positive attributes. (AE A at 4-15) Her \nperformance reports rate her as meeting or exceeding standards. She has received \nnumerous awards and letters of appreciation throughout her career. (AE G; AE H) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s financial history includes a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy filed in 1998 and discharged in 1999. While she is able to pay her \nmonthly expenses, her poor judgment in entering into the real estate investment \nagreement with an Internet company without exercising proper due diligence resulted in \nher becoming responsible for three mortgages totaling $757,000. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. While \nApplicant claims that she was unaware that the contract she entered into involved \nmortgage fraud, she should have conducted more due diligence before entering into the \nagreement. Even before the fraud was disclosed, she should have been aware of the \nincredible risks involved in using your good credit history in an agreement that involved \nindividuals (distressed homeowners) with poor credit.  \n \nAt the very least, Applicant should have consulted a reputable real estate \nattorney prior to entering into this agreement to discuss its validity and legality. She \nadmits that she was unfamiliar with these real estate transactions even though she had \nbeen a licensed realtor for years. Although Applicant is a victim of the mortgage fraud \nscam, her judgment appears to have been swayed by the temptation of easy money. A \nlittle due diligence upfront would have prevented her present situation. At the close of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe record, the status of the three mortgages and what affect, if any, the mortgage fraud \ncase will have on Applicant is unknown. Doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. After the 1999 bankruptcy \ndischarge, Applicant\u2019s financial situation has remained relatively stable. At the time she \nentered into this agreement, Applicant was not facing financial problems that were \nbeyond her control. She was looking for investment opportunities. She entered into an \nagreement which she should have known carried tremendous risks to her financial \nsituation and credit rating. With proper due diligence, she could have avoided entering \ninto such a risky agreement.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) is partially applicable. Applicant received financial counseling in the late 90s in \nconjunction with her bankruptcy filing. Her financial situation remained stable after \nbankruptcy. However, her recent issues involving the three mortgages are unlikely to  \nbe resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) partially applies. Applicant is attempting to get the \nbanks that hold the mortgages to agree to a short sale and/or a deed in lieu of \nforeclosure. However, at the close of the record, the status of the mortgages remains \nuncertain.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 24 years of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nservice as a civil servant. I considered all of her favorable performance reports, her \nawards, and the glowing references provided by her superiors, co-workers, and friends. \nWhile I believe Applicant was remorseful and forthcoming about the issue with the three \nmortgages, questions remains about her judgment. Having several years experience as \na licensed real estate agent, she should have understood the risks associated with \nentering into this investment agreement. The lure of easy money clouded her judgment. \nThe same lure could cloud her judgment in protecting and handling classified \ninformation. While she has made some attempt to either sell the properties or submit a \ndeed in lieu of foreclosure on each property, she provided no definitive resolution at the \nclose of the hearing. Applicant has not met her burden to mitigate the concerns raised \nunder financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not   \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 47-year-old engineer who has held a Secret security clearance since 1989, and he briefly held a Top Secret security clearance in 2000. In late 2006, as part of the background investigation process to be considered for access to Sensitive Compartment Information (SCI), Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During his interview, Applicant admitted viewing pornography since he was a child. He intentionally searched for and accessed child pornography online a couple of times per week from the mid 1990s to at least September 2006. The frequency varied. At times he viewed it every night and then stopped for awhile. He stopped because he felt guilty about his conduct and he feared legal repercussions. He was concerned that it would put his security clearance in jeopardy and would make him vulnerable if his actions were known.1 Applicant visited online newsgroups and Usenet sites that contained pornographic images featuring children. He specifically searched these sites for child pornography. He was cautious about searching the World Wide Web, and did so only occasionally, because it was more risky.2 Applicant \u201cburned\u201d up to 1,000 CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s containing exclusively graphic still photos and videos depicting sexually explicitly images of children and adu",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nD, Sexual Behavior, E, Personal Conduct, and J, Criminal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 18, 2009, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on July 21, 2009. The FORM was mailed to Applicant \non July 22, 2009, and it was received on July 28, 2009. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not provide additional information. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 8, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old engineer who has held a Secret security clearance \nsince 1989, and he briefly held a Top Secret security clearance in 2000. In late 2006, as \npart of the background investigation process to be considered for access to Sensitive \nCompartment Information (SCI), Applicant was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator.   \n \n \nDuring his interview, Applicant admitted viewing pornography since he was a \nchild. He intentionally searched for and accessed child pornography online a couple of \ntimes per week from the mid 1990s to at least September 2006. The frequency varied. \nAt times he viewed it every night and then stopped for awhile. He stopped because he \nfelt guilty about his conduct and he feared legal repercussions. He was concerned that it \nwould put his security clearance in jeopardy and would make him vulnerable if his \nactions were known.1  \n \n \nApplicant visited online newsgroups and Usenet sites that contained \npornographic images featuring children. He specifically searched these sites for child \npornography. He was cautious about searching the World Wide Web, and did so only \noccasionally, because it was more risky.2  \n \n \nApplicant \u201cburned\u201d up to 1,000 CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s containing exclusively graphic \nstill photos and videos depicting sexually explicitly images of children and adults \nengaged in sexual activity. Applicant collected images of children as young as infants \nand as old as 17. He intentionally sought out \u201chardcore\u201d pornographic images of \nchildren. Applicant masturbated when viewing child pornography.3  \n \n \n1 Items 6, 7. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn September 2006, after his background interview, Applicant made a decision to \nstop viewing child pornography. He admits to being tempted, but diverts himself to adult \npornography.4  \n \n \nApplicant met with a psychologist five times from September 2006 to November \n2006, to discuss his pornography addiction. His psychologist wanted him to give up all \nforms of pornography, but he was reluctant because it was his lone outlet for sexual \nrelease. He was referred to another psychologist. He did not contact this psychologist \nuntil March 2007, because he wanted to see if he could stop the behavior on his own. \nHis behavior decreased, but he could not stop it, so he contacted the psychologist. He \nattends sex addicts anonymous (SAA). He realizes he has a problem with viewing \npornography. He intends to continue attending SAA and seeing his psychologist. He \nhas not disclosed his pornography addiction to his family, friends, or coworkers.5  \n \n \nSince January 2007, Applicant avoids situations where he is alone with a child \nand situations that might tempt him to act out.6  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern pertaining to sexual behavior:  \n \nSexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b613 that could \nraise a security concern and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; and \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAppellant has been viewing and collecting child pornography since the mid-\n1990s until September 2006. Possession of child pornography is illegal. His behavior \noccurred several times a week and sometimes daily, indicating a pattern of compulsive \nand self-destructive behavior. He attempted to stop but was unable. He has sought \nassistance from a psychologist. He is aware that his conduct is illegal and is concerned \nabout the legal ramifications and security concerns. His family, friends, and coworkers \nare unaware of his conduct, which makes him vulnerable to coercion. I find all of the \nabove disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b614. I have especially \nconsidered the following:  \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.  \n \nAfter considering all of the evidence, I find none of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b616 that could raise \na security concern and have especially considered the following: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant viewed and collected explicit and graphic child pornography. His \nconduct began in the mid-1990s and continued until at least September 2006. He \nsometimes masturbated while viewing the child pornography. None of his family or \nfriends are aware of his conduct. He admitted that his behavior makes him vulnerable to \nlegal action. I find the above disqualifying condition applies.  \nI have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b617 \nincluding: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant has sought counseling from a psychologist and attends SAA to help \nchange his behavior. He has been viewing and collecting \u201chardcore\u201d child pornography \nfor years. He did not seek counseling until he became aware that his security clearance \nwas in jeopardy. No information was provided about the progress of his recovery. No \ninformation was provided regarding the diagnosis or prognosis about his apparent \naddiction. Based on the evidence, I conclude his actions are likely to recur. Applicant\u2019s \nactions are illegal and potentially subject to prosecution. His family, friends, and \ncoworkers are unaware of his conduct. He is concerned about his behavior becoming \npublic. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant has been viewing and collecting, including \u201cburning\u201d CDs and DVDs, of \ngraphic, sexually explicit, child pornography since the mid-1990s. His actions are illegal \nand subject to prosecution.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and  \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in the record and conclude none of the \nabove mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held a security \nclearance since 1989. He has been viewing pornography since he was young. In the \nmid 1990s he began viewing, downloading, and copying on to CDs and DVDs sexually \nexplicit child pornography. It is illegal to possess child pornography and Applicant is \n\n \n8 \n \n \npotentially subject to criminal prosecution. He is concerned about the legal ramifications \nof his actions. His family, friends, and coworkers are unaware of his conduct. He sought \ncounseling after he was interviewed by the government and learned that his behavior \nbecame a security issue. Viewing adult pornography is not illegal. It is not disqualifying \nto make a decision to stop viewing child pornography or to seek assistance from a \npsychologist or avoid situations that might be tempting. Therefore, I find for Applicant on \nthese allegations. Applicant failed to provide any independent evidence to corroborate \nhis assertions that he is in therapy or that he has control over his sexual addiction. He \nhas a long history of illegal sexual behavior. There is significant potential for \nvulnerability, coercion, and exploitation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions about Appellant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Appellant has failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guidelines for Sexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, and Criminal \nConduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn November 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 16, 2009, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on June 2, 2009, and did not respond with any information within the\n30 days permitted. The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2009.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nNovember 5, 2009\n\n Relevant and material information identified as \u201cItems\u201d in the FORM are referenced as exhibits\n1\nto ensure consistency with the way documentary materials are identified in hearing proceedings.\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 11 delinquent\ndebts, exceeding $66,000 as follows: creditor 1.a ($20,954); creditor 1.b ($18,841);\ncreditor 1.c ($59); creditor 1.d ($73); creditor 1.e ($2,933); creditor 1.f ($380); creditor\n1.g ($133); creditor 1.h ($187); creditor 1.i ($289); creditor 1.j ($578); and creditor 1.k\n($22,525). One of the debts (creditor 1.a) represents an adverse judgment entered\nagainst Applicant. Another (creditor 1.k) represents the deficiency balance on a\nrepossessed vehicle.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the debts, but denied\nothers.  He claimed some of the debts that he admitted generally contained the wrong\namounts (i.e., creditors 1.a and 1.b).  He claimed the medical debts identified in SOR\nparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f through 1.h represent medical bills that should rightfully\nhave been paid by his medical insurance.  And he claimed the debt alleged in SOR 1.k\nwas a duplication of the debt alleged in SOR 1.a. He provided no explanations of the\ncircumstances surrounding his admitted debts, or what steps he had taken to resolve\nthem.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old entry-level technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant has been married to his spouse since August 1978 (see ex. 1).   He\n1\nhas no children from this marriage.  He retired from the U.S. Army in September 2005\nafter 13 years of active duty and an additional 11 years of reserve duty (see exs. 1, 7\nand 10).  His service discharge certificate documents his entry on active duty in 1977\nand his retirement date in December 2005 (see exs. 6, 7 and 10).\nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts between 2004 and 2008.\nHis listed delinquencies are documented in both of his credit reports and exceed\n$66,000 in aggregate indebtedness (see exs. 8 and 9).  One of these debts represents\nan outstanding judgment that was taken against him in November 2007 by creditor 1.a\nfor $16,209 (see exs. 8 and 9).  This judgment is associated with a voluntary vehicle\nrepossession in Spring 2004 (ex. 10).  When Applicant could not pay the assessed\ndeficiency, the creditor sued to recover its entitled deficiency and obtained its judgment.\nThe creditor 1.a and creditor 1.k debts reflect duplicate accounts (see exs. 6 and 8\nthrough 10).\n  \nApplicant attributes most of his admitted debts to recurrent conditions of\nunderemployment between 2005 and 2007. His security clearance application reports\nperiods of underemployment between September 2005 and November 2007 (see exs.\n1 and 10). His submissions provide no details of his earnings and expenses during\n\n3\nthese reported years.  Without more financial information from Applicant about himself\nand his spouse during the pertinent period of reported debt delinquencies, his monetary\ncircumstances cannot be properly evaluated.  \nSeveral of the listed debts in the SOR are disputed by Applicant.  He denies\nfinancial responsibility for the medical debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f\nthrough 1.h of the SOR.  He claims these debts should have been paid by TRICARE\n(ex. 6). Applicant provided no documentation, though, to support his claims.  He\nindicated in his personal subject interview with an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) in February 2008 that he had no information concerning\nthese medical accounts (ex. 7). Whether these listed medical bills should have been\ncovered by TRICARE cannot be determined without more input and documentation\nfrom Applicant.\nApplicant could provide no financial information either about most of his non-\nmedical debts in his personal interview with the OPM investigator. Although he was\nafforded an opportunity to supplement the record, Applicant provided no endorsements\nor performance evaluations on his behalf.  Nor did he provide any proof of community\nand civic contributions. His service records confirm that he received numerous\nmeritorious and commendation awards during his military service (see ex. 6). His\ncertificate of retirement documents his completion of various leadership and instructor\ncourses and numerous service performance awards (ex. 6).  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\n\n4\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n5\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an entry-level technician of a defense contractor who accumulated\na number of delinquent debts (to include an adverse judgment) during recurrent\nperiods of underemployment. His accumulation of delinquent debts and his past\ninability and unwillingness to address these debts warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR negate the\nneed for any independent proof (see McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006)).\nEach of Applicant\u2019s listed debts are fully documented in his latest credit reports and\nprovide ample corroboration of his debts.\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his inability to find well-paying work\nfollowing his retirement from the U.S. Army in 2005.  His largest debt is a deficiency\nresulting from a car repossession.  It was reduced to a judgment in 2007 and remains\noutstanding.  While one of the listed debts (creditor 1.k) is a proven duplication of the\ndebt covered by subparagraph 1.a of the SOR, all of the remaining debts covered in\nthe SOR are either unpaid or unresolved. \nBased on the documented materials in the FORM, some extenuating\ncircumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s inability to pay of or otherwise resolve\nhis debts. Available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly.\u201d\nMoreover, some judgment problems persist, too, over Applicant\u2019s unexplained\ndelinquencies and his failure to demonstrate he acted responsibly in addressing his\nlisted debts once the underemployment conditions that contributed to the\ndelinquencies had passed or eased, and his finances had improved. See ISCR Case\n03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004).  Not only are his listed debt delinquencies\nongoing, but he has failed to address them in any tangible way.  Mitigation credit is\nnot available to Applicant based on the evidence developed in this record.         \n                                          \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\n\n6\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While\nthe principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are also explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve\nhis debts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about whether the\napplicant has demonstrated the trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts. Since his\ndischarge from the Army in 2005, he has not shown any manifest effort in addressing\nany of his covered debts to mitigate his still delinquent accounts.  Resolution of his\ndelinquent accounts is a critical prerequisite to his regaining control of his  finances.\nWhile underemployment conditions might have played a considerable role in\nhis accumulation of so many debts over a relatively short period, Applicant failed to\nprovide any explanatory material for consideration.  Endorsements and performance\nevaluations might have been helpful, too, in making a whole-person assessment of\nhis overall clearance eligibility, but were not provided. Overall, clearance eligibility\nassessment of Applicant based on the limited amount of information available for\nconsideration in this record does not enable him to establish judgment and trust levels\nsufficient to overcome security concerns arising out of his accumulation of delinquent\ndebts.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, his lack of any exhibited explanations for his debt\naccruals, and his failure to provide any proof of  corrective actions taken to address\nhis old debts, it is still soon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability\nto repay his debts and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with the\nminimum requirements for holding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j.   Subparagraph 1.k is mitigated.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the 2(a) factors enumerated in the AGs.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n7\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a through 1.j:\n     Against Applicant\nSubpara.   1.k:\n     For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Contacts) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn her response to the SOR, dated September 2, 2008, Applicant admitted all\nallegations raised with exculpatory explanations. She also requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. The case was ultimately assigned to me on September 18,\n2008. Department Counsel and Applicant, through her counsel, agreed to a October 22,\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n These documents were issued between September 1999 and March 2008.\n1\n Ex. 4 (Administrative Notice) at 2-3.\n2\n Tr. 58. Despite this status, the mother is currently in Taiwan helping care for her divorced son\u2019s daughter.\n3\n Id.\n4\n2\n2008, hearing date. A Notice of Hearing was issued by DOHA on October 6, 2008,\nsetting the hearing for that date. \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted 19 exhibits\n(Ex.) which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-19 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted 19 exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-S without objection. Five witnesses were\ncalled. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 3, 2008. The record was closed\non November 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony,\nsecurity clearance is granted.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government requested administrative notice of certain facts regarding\nTaiwan, including that country\u2019s precarious position in relation to the People\u2019s Republic\nof China and the U.S. Government\u2019s \u201cone-China\u201d policy. In support of its position on\nthese facts, it introduced Exs. 5-19 as applicable resources.  Citing to a 2000 Annual\n1\nReport to Congress from the National Counterintelligence Center, it notes that Taiwan\nis among the most active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.  It\n2\nalso cites to various cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of\nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to Taiwan. The Government\u2019s request is granted.\nApplicant declined to object to the documents, but added without objection Ex. Q, an\nOctober 14, 2008, news article regarding the $6.5 billion arms sale the United States\nmade to Taiwan shortly before the hearing. All the documents have been reviewed and\ngiven due consideration in light of the particular facts of this case.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior software engineer who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since 2005. She was born in Taiwan, the daughter of a carpenter\nand a dressmaker. Her father is deceased. Her retired 73-year-old mother remains a\ncitizen of Taiwan, but has permanent resident status in the United States (U.S.).  Her\n3\nsister is single, a private school bus driver, and her divorced brother is a stock advisor\nwith custody of his daughter. Her siblings are also citizens of Taiwan, but both have\nbeen approved for permanent resident status in the U.S. At the time of the hearing, they\nwere awaiting visas so they can relocate to the U.S.  The family is expected to be\n4\nreunited in early 2009. Applicant has never married and has no children.\nAfter receiving her Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1988, Applicant came to\nthe U.S. to pursue graduate studies. She accepted a scholarship in 1989 and\n\n Tr. 40-42.\n5\n Tr. 43-44.\n6\n Tr. 46.\n7\n Indeed, in completing her 2006 security clearance application, she marked question 8d (Countries of Dual\n8\nCitizenship) as \u201cnot applicable.\u201d\n Tr. 44.\n9\n Tr. 47, 97-100. On Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, she noted the expiration of her Taiwan\n10\npassport as September 2006, the month it was relinquished. Had she not relinquished her passport, it would\nhave expired in 2014. Tr. 67.\n Tr. 54.\n11\n3\ngraduated with a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in 1992. She received her second\nM.S. degree in 1994. After graduation, she moved to her present area of residence,\nwhere some of her friends and colleagues had moved, but entry level work was difficult\nto find.  She did, however, receive a recruitment offer to move to a more costly region,\nwhich she accepted in 1995. The company was favorably impressed by her work. With\nthe company\u2019s encouragement, she applied for permanent residency. She became\nactive in her church and with musical groups. She started looking at real estate while\nearning her state real estate license. She received her green card in February 2000.\nShe declined to buy a home initially, however, because the area in which she was then\nemployed had a high cost of living, a highly inflated real estate market, and she found\nthe climate disagreeable.  \n5\nOver the next few years, Applicant began to consider the United States as her\nhome. She applied for U.S. citizenship in 2004. In 2005, she thought of again trying to\nfind work in the area in which her friends and colleagues resided and which had a\nreasonable cost of living. She found a job through a friend and moved later that year.\nShe became active in that community, especially with her local church and in an\norchestra, and has been fully accepted into that community. She enjoys her work, is\npaid a competitive salary, and is building a retirement.\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in September 2006 with every intent of spending\nthe rest of her life in the U.S.  She took her oath very seriously, especially those\n6\nsections dealing with renunciation of other ties with other countries and taking up arms\nto defend the U.S.  It was her understanding that this renunciation obviated her\n7\nqualification as a dual citizen.  Three days after becoming a citizen, she got her voter\u2019s\n8\nregistration card, seeing it as an important right of her citizenship.  Similarly she applied\n9\nfor a U.S. passport. She turned her Taiwanese passport over to her security manager in\nSeptember 2006 with a note again stating that she renounced her past citizenship and\nrelinquished her passport.  \n10\nIn the past 20 years, Applicant has visited Taiwan four times.  She used her\n11\nTaiwanese passport for each trip because the trips were taken before she became a\n\n Tr. 83.\n12\n Tr. 52.\n13\n Tr. 53, 59-61; Ex. K.\n14\n Tr. 55-57.\n15\n Tr. 65.\n16\n Tr. 66.\n17\n4\nU.S. citizen in September 2006. Her last Taiwanese passport was issued in March 2004\nand was set to expire in March 2014, but it was relinquished to her security manager in\nSeptember 2006 upon becoming a U.S. citizen. Her four trips to Taiwan were her only\ntrips abroad in the past two decades. Applicant\u2019s employer was apprised of each of\nthese trips.  The sole purpose of the trips was to visit her parents and siblings.\n12\nApplicant formerly had a small interest in four real estate properties in Taiwan\nthat she inherited from her father when he died in 2000. Those properties are\nmaintained by Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings. Her interest was a 1/76th or 1/60th\ninterest.  She was initially unaware of this inheritance. She learned of it when she was\n13\npreparing her 2006 security clearance application and she asked her family if she had\nany foreign interests remaining in Taiwan. Not wishing to have any apparent conflicts,\nshe sold her interest in one of the properties and transferred her interest in the other\nthree properties to her niece.  She no longer has any property interests in Taiwan. In\n14\ncontrast, she has been house hunting in her current town for a while, but has been\ncautious given the currently volatile real estate market.  Her pension and savings are\n15\nhere in the U.S.\nApplicant has never been approached by members of a foreign government\nwhile in the U.S. or while visiting Taiwan. She is aware of the appropriate protocols\nshould she ever be thus contacted. None of her family work for a foreign government.\nThe only time any member of her family has been contacted by a government official\nwas when her brother was questioned about his business practices. In that situation,\nhowever, the brother was simply released without charges.  \n16\nApplicant\u2019s contact with her siblings is infrequent, usually pertaining to their\nmother or calls made on holidays. They do not discuss their respective jobs.  Applicant\n17\nis waiting for her siblings to emigrate to the U.S. so they can be here with their mother.\nAt work, Applicant works for a smaller entity with limited resources and projects.\nIt lacks the major name recognition of many defense contractors. She is well regarded\nfor both her work performance and personality. She is completely open about her life.\nShe is trusted by her employer and colleagues, who have no reservations regarding her\nacquisition of a security clearance.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n18\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n19\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n20\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n18\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n19\n20\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\n\n Id.\n21\n Id.\n22\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n23\n AG \u00b6 9.\n24\n AG \u00b6 10(a). \n25\n6\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n21\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n22\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n23\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Contacts) to be the most pertinent to the case.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C \u2013 Foreign Preference. \nThe concern regarding foreign preference is that when an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the U.S.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\n24\ninclude exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  \n25\nThe SOR contains two allegations. First, that available information showed that\nApplicant exercised dual citizenship with Taiwan and the United States. Second, that\navailable information showed that she possessed a Taiwanese passport that was set to\nnaturally expire in March 2014. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and the relevant documents indicate that since taking the\noath of U.S. citizenship in September 2006, Applicant has not exercised any rights of\ncitizenship of any country other than the U.S. This includes the retention of a\nTaiwanese passport, possession of which appears to have been her only exercise of\nTaiwanese citizenship in the past 20 years. Her highly credible testimony, personal\nconduct, and her security clearance application all demonstrate that she took her oath\nof U.S. citizenship seriously, particularly with regard to her renunciation of her\n\n As noted by Department Counsel in his closing argument: \u201cAnd under Guideline C we don\u2019t see any dispute\n26\nwith respect to her having turned over her passport to the cognizant Security authority. But Guideline B\nremains a concern.\u201d Tr. 102.\n7\nTaiwanese citizenship. In fact, upon becoming a .S. citizen, she surrendered her\nTaiwanese passport to the cognizant security authority despite the fact it was good\nthrough 2014. Lacking evidence of an exercise of dual citizenship and with her\nTaiwanese passport so relinquished, no security concerns remain under Guideline C\nand no further discussion of that guideline is necessary.  Foreign Preference Security\n26\nConcerns have been mitigated.\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence\nThe concern under Guideline B is that foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. The adjudication can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are\nset forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nWhen Applicant emigrated from Taiwan, she left behind a mother, who is a\npermanent resident of the U.S., but remains a citizen of Taiwan. Similarly, she left\nbehind two siblings, both of whom recently received permanent U.S. citizen status, but\nremain citizens of Taiwan. Applicant maintains contact with these relatives. Over the\npast two decades, Applicant has returned to Taiwan to visit them. Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7a (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) and AG \u00b6 7b (connections to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information) apply.\nWith disqualifying conditions thus raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate\nsecurity concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is currently in Taiwan, helping raise her granddaughter.\nApplicant maintains contact with her mother and siblings. While infrequent, their\nrelations are naturally familial. Consequently, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI\nMC) AG \u00b6 8c (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation) does not apply. Similarly, neither AG \u00b6 8a (the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\n\n8\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) nor AG \u00b6 8c (contact\nor communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation) apply. \nThe facts show, however, that Applicant works for a smaller entity with limited\nresources and projects. It does not have major name recognition. Neither Applicant nor\nher family discuss their work. Applicant duly reported her foreign travel to her employer.\nApplicant has never been approached by foreign nationals while either at home or\nabroad. Should such contact be made, Applicant is fully aware of her reporting\nobligations and is capable of fulfilling them. Her family in Taiwan has never been\napproached by government or other officials regarding Applicant. Therefore, FI MC AG\n\u00b6 8e (the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding\nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations\nfrom a foreign country). \nFurthermore, Applicant has spent her entire adult and professional life in the\nU.S. Through two graduate programs and two employers over 20 years, she has\ncultivated many friends and colleagues in the U.S. She has become a member of a\nsolid community here, active with both her church and a local orchestra, and it is her\nintent to spend the rest of her life in the U.S. To that end, she has helped her mother\nand siblings attain permanent resident status in the U.S. and she is awaiting their arrival\nwithin the next few months. Upon arrival, Applicant will have no ties to Taiwan.\nMoreover, Applicant is currently seeking to buy a home in her area of residence. \nFurther, taking her oath of citizenship seriously, Applicant cut all ties to the\ngovernment of Taiwan. She disposed of her property interests and relinquished her\nTaiwanese passport. She has no residual sense of loyalty or obligation to Taiwan. She\nis proud to call the U.S. her home and has gone to great lengths to minimize even the\nappearance of divided loyalties. Her unwavering devotion to the U.S. is notable. The\nfacts give rise to FI MC AG \u00b6 8b (there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\n\n9\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant has many factors which speak in her favor. She is\nmature, articulate, analytical, and well-educated. She has spent two decades, nearly\nher entire adult life in the U.S. During that time, she made and maintained friendships\nand professional contacts to the exclusion of any non-familial ties in Taiwan. She has\nbeen continuously employed in the U.S., earns a handsome salary, and is building a\nretirement fund. She has pursued a real estate license to help her understand the ins\nand outs of the real estate market. Applicant is looking into buying a home of her own.\nWith her encouragement, her remaining family have gained permanent resident status\nin the U.S. and are soon to relocate to the U.S. In taking her oath of citizenship, she\nclearly and volitionally renounced her ties to Taiwan, sold her foreign property interests,\nand relinquished her foreign passport. She has never been questioned by a foreign\nagent, nor has a foreign agent ever contacted her family regarding her. Today, her sole\ncountry of preference and interest is the U.S. and her only passport is issued by the\nU.S.\nThe main factor speaking against Applicant is her country of birth, Taiwan, and\nits relationship with the Republic of China. The literature is extensive with regard to\nTaiwan\u2019s information gathering. To some degree, trust between the U.S. and Taiwan\nhas hit a new high with the recent $6.5 billion arms sale the United States made to\nTaiwan. As well, Applicant\u2019s family has no significant ties to either the Taiwan or\nChinese government. They have thus far \u201clived under the radar\u201d with regard to their\nhaving a family member in the U.S. None have worked for a foreign government and\nnone are dependent on a foreign government\u2019s largesse. More importantly, her family\nmembers have U.S. permanent residency status and are anticipated to relocate here in\nthe near future, if they have not already. There is no reason to believe that now, after\n20 years in the U.S., a foreign entity may take interest in this emigrating family. \nToday, Applicant\u2019s sole country of preference is the U.S., and her only passport\nis U.S.-issued. No evidence has been presented that she has any residual indications\nof foreign preference which have not been addressed, nor is there any hint that she\nmight be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the U.S.\nWhile foreign influence was discussed above, it is interesting to note that Applicant\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s only government contact had to do with her brother\u2019s stock market activities,\nnot with Applicant. Otherwise, she and her family have thus far escaped notice by\nforeign governments. Moreover, despite the many negative points about Taiwan and its\nrelationship with China, recent events in 2008 show that the U.S. is working closer to\nTaiwan toward their mutual benefit. With foreign interest and preference security\nconcerns mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\n\n10\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn June 13, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (SF 86) to renew a security clearance required for her job with a defense\ncontractor, where she works as a senior data coordinator. After reviewing the results of\nApplicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. On October 14, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\nMarch 17, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1 - 9) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\n(SOR) alleging facts which have raised security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing. On December 8, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n3\nreceived the FORM on January 6, 2009, and was given 30 days to file a response to the\nFORM. She timely responded to the FORM and the case was assigned to me on March\n3, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $25,220 for 13 delinquent\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.m. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one\nof the allegations. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.i, asserting the debt was paid through a\nsettlement offer. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make\nthe following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 28 years old and, since June 2005, has worked for a defense\ncontractor. She served in the U.S. Air Force from January 2001 until January 2005.\nAfter leaving the Air Force, she was unemployed until she was hired by her current\nemployer. Applicant first received a security clearance in 2001 and the SF 86 she\nsubmitted in 2007 appears to be for a periodic re-investigation of her suitability for\naccess to classified information.\nApplicant has three children, ages 5, 4, and 3. She and her husband were\nmarried in April 2001. They separated after she left the Air Force, but reconciled around\nthe time she was hired by her employer. In July 2005, the couple bought a van for their\nfamily, financing $32,671 for the purchase. However, when Applicant\u2019s husband lost his\njob because the electrical company where he worked closed, they could not afford the\npayments and surrendered the car to the finance company. Applicant still owes\napproximately $14,746 for the balance due on the loan after the car was resold.\nApplicant had accrued several credit card and other personal credit obligations while\nshe was in the Air Force; however, after she left the service she was unable to continue\npaying those debts.\nApplicant used a debt relief agency to whom she paid $275 each month between\nNovember 2006 and June 2007. However, she stopped using the firm when she\nrealized that, as often happens with such firms, the money was being taken as\nadministrative costs rather than being used to pay down her debts. As to subsequent\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\nefforts to resolve her debts, she asserted in her subject interview, in response to the\nSOR, and in response to the FORM that she is (a) planning to settle her debts by\nFebruary 2009, (b) will use or has used her income tax refunds to pay down her debts,\n(c) after speaking with creditors and reaching settlement agreements with some, she\nhas set up a savings account into which funds are automatically deposited from her\npaycheck to use for repayment, (d) she has or will consult with a financial counselor\nwho will help her adhere to a budget, and (e) she will get a second job so she can pay\ndown her debts faster. Applicant has not submitted any documentation to corroborate\nthese claims.\nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA adjudicators, Applicant submitted a\npersonal financial statement that showed she has about $263 remaining each month\nafter expenses. That figure includes payment on the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in the\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.m. Further, Applicant admitted to all but one (SOR \u00b6 1.i) of the\nallegations. As to her denial, the debt is documented in the government\u2019s information\n(FORM, Item 8), but it is unclear what information in the file corroborates Applicant\u2019s\nassertion she paid the debt. The file contains a receipt for payment of $109.67 (FORM,\nItem 6); however, there is no apparent explanation for this payment. Even assuming it is\nin satisfaction of SOR \u00b6 1.i, the record still shows that Applicant has a history of unpaid\ndebts dating back to at least 2005. The record also shows she has been unable or\nunwilling (or both) to pay her debts. She has been steadily employed for nearly four\nyears, but has not paid even those debts of less than $120 each (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.e and\n1.m).

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nRemand Decision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn June 13, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (SF 86) to renew a security clearance required for her job with a defense\ncontractor, where she works as a senior data coordinator. After reviewing the results of\nApplicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. On October 14, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\nJuly 16, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1 - 9) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\n(SOR) alleging facts which have raised security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing. On December 8, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n3\nreceived the FORM on January 6, 2009. \nSection VII of the FORM stated as follows:\nDoD Directive 5220.6, Additional Procedural Guidance.[sic] Paragraph 7\nalso provides that after Department Counsel has submitted the File of\nRelevant Materials, Applicant will be given the opportunity to submit\ndocumentary information in the file. This information must be submitted\nwithin thirty days after receipt by Applicant of the File of Relevant Material\n[sic].\nOn February 2, 2009, less than 30 days after her receipt of the FORM, Applicant\nsubmitted a single-page letter, ostensibly in response to the FORM. In her letter, she\nrepresented that she was taking certain actions to resolve the financial issues raised\nthrough the SOR and addressed in the FORM. Nothing else was submitted.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 3, 2009. On March 17, 2009, I issued a\ndecision in this case denying Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. On May 19,\n2009, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded this case to me \u201cfor further processing.\u201d\nSpecifically, the Appeal Board found as ambiguous and possibly in error my description\nof a personal financial statement (PFS) submitted by Applicant in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories (FORM, Item 7). The Board further determined that such ambiguity may\nhave been \u201cin error and may well have affected [my] evaluation of the case.\u201d (Appeal\nBoard Decision, p. 1 - 2)\nThe Appeal Board also determined that Section VII of the FORM \u201ccontains\nlanguage which may not reasonably have advised Applicant of the nature of her\nopportunity to submit evidence (e.g., documents which would corroborate her claims)\nunder the Directive.\u201d (Appeal Board Decision, p. 2) I was instructed to re-open the\nrecord to allow the Applicant and Department Counsel an opportunity to submit\ninformation.\nI received the case on May 29, 2009. On June 2, 2009, I issued a written order\nnotifying the parties they had until the close of business on Monday, July 6, 2009, to\n\n3\nsubmit additional relevant information in this matter. On June 22, 2009, Department\nCounsel advised me the government would not submit additional information. On July 1,\n2009, I received by facsimile from Applicant, a 29-page document marked for\nidentification as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax. A). I provided a copy to Department Counsel.\nOn July 13, 2009, Department Counsel advised that the government had no objection to\nthe admissibility of Applicant\u2019s submission. Accordingly, the record closed on July 13,\n2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $25,220 for 13 delinquent\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.m. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one\nof the allegations. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.I, asserting the debt was paid through a\nsettlement offer. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and after\nreviewing the FORM, Applicant\u2019s February 2, 2009, response to the FORM, and Ax. A, I\nmake the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 28 years old. Since June 2005, she has worked for a defense\ncontractor. She served in the U.S. Air Force from January 2001 until January 2005.\nAfter leaving the Air Force, she was unemployed until she was hired by her current\nemployer. Applicant first received a security clearance in 2001 and the SF 86 she\nsubmitted in 2007 appears to be for a periodic re-investigation of her suitability for\naccess to classified information.\nApplicant has three children, ages 5, 4, and 3. She and her husband were\nmarried in April 2001. They separated after she left the Air Force, but reconciled around\nthe time she was hired by her employer. In July 2005, the couple bought a van for their\nfamily, financing $32,671 for the purchase. However, when Applicant\u2019s husband lost his\njob because the electrical company where he worked closed, they could not afford the\npayments and surrendered the car to the finance company. Applicant still owes\napproximately $14,746 for the balance due on the loan after the car was resold.\nApplicant had accrued several credit card and other personal credit obligations while\nshe was in the Air Force; however, after she left the service, she was unable to continue\npaying those debts.\nApplicant used a debt relief agency to whom she paid $275 each month between\nNovember 2006 and June 2007. However, she stopped using the firm when she\nrealized that, as often happens with such firms, the money was being taken as\nadministrative costs rather than being used to pay down her debts. As to subsequent\nefforts to resolve her debts, she asserted in her September 2007 subject interview, in\nresponse to the SOR, and in response to the FORM that she is (a) planning to settle her\ndebts by February 2009, (b) will use or has used her income tax refunds to pay down\nher debts, (c) after speaking with creditors and reaching settlement agreements with\nsome of them, she has set up a savings account into which funds are automatically\ndeposited from her paycheck to use for repayment, (d) she has or will consult with a\nfinancial counselor who will help her adhere to a budget, and (e) she will get a second\njob so she can pay down her debts faster. Applicant has not submitted any\ndocumentation to corroborate these claims.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n4\nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA adjudicators in January 2008,\nApplicant submitted a PFS that showed she had, at that time, about $526 remaining\nafter monthly household expenses. After making payments to five personal credit\naccounts (including payments to the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f), she had about\n$263 remaining each month. (FORM, Item 7)\nThe information Applicant submitted through Ax. A shows the following:\na. Applicant is again using a financial counseling firm to help her with a budget\nand a plan to resolve her debts. She asserts she began working with them in\nSeptember 2008, but all of the firm\u2019s information provided in Ax. A (balance sheets and\ncorrespondence) is dated June 20, 2009.\nb. The financial counseling firm concluded that, before she increased her income\nwith her part-time work, even a modest $100 payment on her unsecured debt would\nresult in a $631 monthly deficit. The firm suggested she voluntarily surrender her car\nbecause of the high monthly payment. However, as she experienced in 2005, she would\nprobably incur a deficiency on the car loan. As the firm also recommended that\nApplicant consider bankruptcy, on June 29, 2009, Applicant retained an attorney so she\ncan file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and reaffirm her car loan payment.\nc. According to her July 1, 2009, Ax. A cover letter, Applicant is the sole income\nearner for her family. She claims an increase in monthly income of $3,567. In addition to\nher bi-weekly defense contractor pay of about $925, or $1,850 monthly, she has taken a\npart-time job as a newspaper carrier which nets her about $1,200 monthly. Also, a\nmonthly disability payment from the Veteran\u2019s Administration increased from $471 to\n$519 in December 2008. \nd. Because of her increased pay, she is no longer eligible for food stamps. Her\nmonthly food expenses have increased by $200. Because she uses her car for her part\ntime job, her monthly gas expense has increased $200 and her insurance now costs\n$264 each month. Applicant now estimates she \u201cis incurring a monthly net of $94.52\nafter expenses.\u201d (Ax. A, July 1, 2009, cover letter from Applicant)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n6\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nOn remand, I again find that the government presented sufficient information in\nthe FORM to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.m. Further, Applicant admitted to\nall but one (SOR \u00b6 1.I) of the allegations. As to her denial, the debt is documented in the\ngovernment\u2019s information (FORM, Item 8), but it is unclear what information in the file\ncorroborates Applicant\u2019s assertion that she paid the debt. The file contains a receipt for\npayment of $109.67 (FORM, Item 6); however, there is no apparent explanation for this\npayment. Even assuming it is in satisfaction of SOR \u00b6 1.I, the record still shows that\nApplicant has a history of unpaid debts dating back to at least 2005. The record also\nshows she has been unable or unwilling (or both) to pay her debts. She has been\nsteadily employed for nearly four years, but has not paid even those debts of less than\n$120 each (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.e and 1.m). As to her claims that she has taken action to\nresolve her debts and improve her personal finances, she has provided nothing that\nwould corroborate her statements.\nApplicant\u2019s additional information presented on remand shows she is working\nwith a financial counseling firm. She also claimed she has eliminated some expenses in\norder to save money. However, as with the last such effort, it does not appear that she\nis actually resolving her past delinquencies. In fact, the new information she submitted\nshows that, while her income each month is higher, because of operating expenses and\nloss of public assistance for food, her net monthly cash flow is less than half what it was\nin January 2008. Because it also appears she would incur more debt (as she did in\n2005) through a voluntary repossession of her car, she may also file for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and reaffirm her car loan. However, a discharge of her debts through\nChapter 7 does not change the fact that Applicant still has less than $100 remaining\neach month after expenses and any credit payments.\nBased on the foregoing, I have applied the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations). In response, Applicant\u2019s information supports consideration of the\nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control). However, Applicant used a financial counselor before and to no avail.\nAbsent information, which she has not presented, that shows her current counseling\narrangement may actually help resolve her financial problems, AG \u00b6 20(c) offers little\nbenefit to Applicant. Nor does Applicant\u2019s new information support application of any of\nthe other mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20. \nAs I noted in my original decision, it is understandable that periods of\nunemployment, unexpected reductions in income, or marital separation would cause or\nexacerbate one\u2019s indebtedness. The recent positive steps she has taken to reduce\nexpenses and increase income are commendable. However, all available information\nabout her finances, including the materials she submitted on remand, shows her\nfinancial circumstances have not improved. Further, the available information shows her\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n7\nfinances are not likely to be resolved in the near future. Accordingly, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s adverse information about her finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant has not presented any\nnew information on remand that changes my original conclusions. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances\n8\nstill shows she has failed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about her\nability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as her own. Because\nprotection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts\nmust be resolved in favor of the government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born and raised in Great Britain to parents of British citizenship. He earned a PhD in Chemistry in Great Britain in 1975 and completed post-graduate work in Canada in 1976 (R.T., at 52). 3 Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1976 to work for a manufacturing company. He worked for this company for several years before moving to another region of the U.S. to pursue different scientific interests (R.T., at 52-53). Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2006 and obtained his U.S. passport the same month and year (see ex. 2; R.T., at 72)).

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 3, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 30, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nDecember 3,  2008.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and 10 exhibits.  The\ntranscript (R.T.) was received on December 12, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nJanuary 14, 2009\n\n2\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to consider retention of\nhis British passport and document its surrender should he make the decision to do so.\nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days, to December 12, 2008 to\nsupplement the record. The Government was afforded two days to respond.  Within the\ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with e-mailed letters confirming his\ndecision to surrender his British passport and documented surrender of his passport to\nhis employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO).  Department counsel did not object to these\npost-hearing submissions. Applicant\u2019s two post-hearing exhibits were admitted and\nconsidered as exhibits A and B.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to have (a) exercised dual citizenship with\nGreat Britain, (b) possessed a British passport, and (c) used his British passport to enter\nand exit Great Britain in May 2006 and June 2007. \nFor his answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations. He claimed he travels extensively for business and used his British\npassport to enter and European countries for convenience purposes.  He claimed he has\nhe lived in the U.S. for over 30 years and bears allegiance to the U.S. since he  became\na naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2006.  He claimed to have designed and patented a\nnew permanent resident card (introduced in 1998) that has proved extremely resistant to\nfraudulent duplication or alteration and has become the standard for ID cards world-wide\nand a permanent resident card (PRC) that is recognized by U.S. Government agencies.\nHe claimed to be working on the design of the next generation secure PRC and claimed\nhis use of his British passport when traveling to Europe is in the best national interests of\nthe U.S. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old chief operating officer (COO) of a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in Great Britain to parents of British citizenship. \nHe earned a PhD in Chemistry in Great Britain in 1975 and completed post-graduate\nwork in Canada in 1976 (R.T., at 52).\n\n3\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1976 to work for a manufacturing company.\nHe worked for this company for several years before moving to another region of the\nU.S. to pursue different scientific interests (R.T., at 52-53). \nApplicant  became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2006 and obtained his U.S.\npassport the same month and year (see ex. 2; R.T., at 72)).  Applicant delayed applying\nfor U.S. citizenship, because at the time, he did not think he would be staying in the U.S.\n(R.T., at 54).  Since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2006, though, he has voted in every U.S.\nelection for the past two years and has been called for jury service (R.T., at 60).\nApplicant is married and has two children (19 and 21 years of age, respectively).\nHis wife (W) became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2006 and is a dual citizen\nwith Great Britain.  Applicant\u2019s children are completely Americanized and have no\nintentions of returning to Great Britain (R.T., at 58).  They, too, hold dual citizenship\nstatus with the U.S. and Great Britain (R.T., at 56-57).  They were able to obtain dual\ncitizenship through Applicant and W (ex. 2).  Neither Applicant nor W have exercised any\nrights of British citizenship, except for Applicant\u2019s possession and use of his British\npassport between May 2006 and June 2007 when he travels to Japan, Great Britain and\nother European countries (see ex. 2; R.T., at 72-73). \nApplicant designed and patented a unique PRC in 1995 and 1999 (see exs. A and\nB; R.T., at 41).  He assigned the patents to the corporation he co-founded in 1982 (R.T.,\nat 63).  He developed this card initially for use in Canada as a secure tamper-proof ID\ncard.  Applicant considers this card to be totally immune to compromise and the most\nsecure publicly issued ID card in the world.  Newspaper accounts covering his PRC and\ncompetitive ID cards developed abroad corroborate his claims (see ex. C). For\ncomparative purposes, a recent newspaper article covering competitive secure ID cards\nin Thailand reports technology theft and risks of future compromise (see ex. G; R.T., at\n47-48). \n Applicant\u2019s PRC, by contrast, is tamper proof and is used by a number of U.S.\nGovernment agencies (see exs. C through  F; R.T., at 42-49).  Published Department of\nJustice (DoJ) accounts of this laser-etched  ID card credit its use with the seizure of\nmore than 2,000 counterfeit cards in 1998 alone (see ex.  C). Immigration officials with\nDoJ stress the unique engraving features of Applicant\u2019s PRC and predict that its use will\nvirtually eliminate mass production of counterfeit ID cards (ex. C).  Applicant is currently\nworking on the next generation U.S. Green Card, which he expects to introduce in March\n2009 (R.T., at 48-49). \nApplicant travels extensively throughout Europe to market his PRC and (since\nbecoming a naturalized U.S. citizen) uses his British passport to facilitate his trips to\nJapan, Great Britain and other European countries (see ex. 2; R.T., at 46-47, 72-73).\nHeretofore, he has expressed his intention to retain his British passport and citizenship.\nHe cites his ease of access to European countries with European membership as an\nimportant travel benefit when he uses his British passport for entry purposes, and for this\n\n4\nreason, he has worked hard to retain his British citizenship and passport (R.T., at 63-66,\n73-74). \nWere Applicant to use his U.S. passport on his trips to Europe and Japan, he\nassures that he would need a visa to return to the U.S. (R.T., at 65). This, in turn, would\nrequire a visa application, and an estimated week\u2019s travel delay (R.T., at 65-66).  By\ncontrast, when he travels to Japan and other European countries on his British passport,\nhe does not need a visa to enter these countries (R.T., at 65-66, 73).  Accordingly, he\nuses his British passport to enter Japan, Great Britain and other European countries, and\nhis U.S. passport to exit these countries for the U.S. (R.T., at 67, 69, 73). Applicant does\nnot validate his visa claims, though, and it is not fully clear in this record whether this is\nor always has been official U.S. visa policy for returning dual nationals. \nBefore obtaining his U.S. passport (in 2006), Applicant used his British passport\nexclusively to travel to and from Great Britain and other countries (R.T., at 70, 73-74).\nAfter he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, he tended more to blending his use of his\nBritish passport with his U.S. passport.\nShould surrender of his British passport become necessary to ensure his\nobtaining his security clearance necessary, Applicant indicated he would be willing to\nsurrender the passport to his FSO (R.T., at 50).  Expressly afforded an opportunity after\nthe hearing to relinquish his British passport (R.T., at 86-92), Applicant documents his\nsurrender of the passport to his FSO (see ex. K and L).  Under the terms of his passport\nsurrender, his FSO agrees to notify DoD of any return of Applicant\u2019s passport in the\nfuture (see exs. K and L).\nApplicant maintains weekly contact with his parents who are citizens and\nresidents of Great Britain (see ex. 2).  He sees his parents yearly on average when he\neither visits them in Great Britain or they visit him in the U.S.\nApplicant owns a home in the U.S. valued at around $1.3 million and has an\noverall net worth of around $1.5 million (R.T., at 58-59).  Neither he nor W have any\nassets or financial interests in Great Britain (see ex. 2; R.T., at 59, 61-62).  He has a\nbase salary of $300,000.00 a year with the company he owns and operates as a defense\ncontractor (R.T., at 62).  His company who own the patents on his PRC does not license\nthe patents, and so, it does not collect any royalties on them (R.T.,a t 63).  As an\nemployee (COO) of his company, he received $1 per patent as consideration for his\ntransfer of ownership of the patents to his company (R.T., at 63).  The patents remain\nthe property of his company and would stay with the company in the event he were to\nsever his ties with it.\nApplicant documents his grants of a security clearance with another U.S. agency\n(DoJ), and urges DoD to follow the same guidelines used by the DoJ (see ex. J; R.T., at\n49-50).  He is highly regarded by the DoJ who commissioned him to develop a PRC for\ntheir use in 1995.  The DoJ made a leadership award to Applicant in December 1999 in\nrecognition of the PRC he developed for them in the same year (see ex. D).  Applicant\n\n5\nreceived praise and acknowledgments from other public agencies for his PRC designs\nas well (see exs. C through  F; R.T., at 42-45).  Applicant is roundly credited with raising\nsecurity standards for identification cards.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n      Foreign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 9.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted facts\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven\nhave a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\n\n6\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis \nApplicant presents as a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born to British parents,\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1976, and later married W, who like Applicant is a naturalized\nU.S. citizen with dual citizenship with Great Britain.  Both W and Applicant\u2019s children have\ndual citizenship with Great Britain as well. \nAside from possessing a British passport and using it on a number of occasions to\nenter Japan, Great Britain, and other European countries for convenience reasons,\nApplicant has never exercised any active indicia of dual citizenship with Great Britain.\nClaiming his principal affections lie with the U.S., he, nonetheless, retained his British\npassport and citizenship. \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the\nforeign country over the interests of the U.S. The issues, as such, raise concerns over\nApplicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the U.S.\nBy virtue of his birth in his native Great Britain to his parents of British birth and\ncitizenship, Applicant was endowed with dual British citizenship, which could be\nrenounced by his expressed intention or actions.  This, Applicant  has never done, out of\nrespect for his British roots and heritage.  For the first 30 years of his residency in the\nU.S., he used his British passport exclusively on his personal and business trips to Japan,\nGreat Britain and other European countries\nSince becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken no actions and\nexercised no British privileges that can be fairly characterized as active indicia of dual\ncitizenship, save for his limited use of his British passport when traveling to European\ncountries.  He has not voted in any British elections or served in the British military.\nNeither he nor W own or hold any assets or financial interest in Great Britain.  By\ncontrast,  he and W have a sizable asset portfolio in the U.S. \nApplicant has accepted no preferential educational, medical or other benefits from\nGreat Britain since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Nor has he ever performed or\nattempted to perform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the interests of Great\nBritain in preference to the interests of the U.S.\n\n7\nBecause Applicant possessed and used his British passport, the Government may\napply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) of AG \u00b6 9, which provides:\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes\nbut is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in                  \n                   another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.  \nApplicant continued to use his British passport to facilitate his entry into Japan,\nGreat Britain and other European countries between May 2006 and June 2007.  He never\nvoted in a British  election and never served in the British military.  He has never sought\nto hold political office in Great Britain since immigrating to the U.S. or used his British\ncitizenship to protect his financial or business interests.  Although his delays in applying\nfor U.S. citizenship are a little troubling, his demonstrated loyalties and commitments\nhave consistently been directed to the U.S. and its core values.  His property and financial\ninterests are located exclusively in the U.S., and he has voted consistently in U.S.\nelections since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2006.  There is no probative evidence of his\never receiving any educational. Medical or retirement benefits from Great Britain. \nBy relinquishing his British passport, Applicant has complied with the mitigation\nrequirements of MC \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d of AG \u00b6 9. And, while his\nsurrendering his British  passport to his FSO does not automatically mitigate any past use\nof the passport to enter and exit European countries, his recited limited use of the\npassport is insufficient by itself to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s preference for Great Britain\nover the U.S.\nFailure to satisfy a mitigating condition may be taken into account when assessing\nan applicant\u2019s overall claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, but may\nnot be turned into a disqualifying condition.  See ISCR Case No. 01-02270 (Appeal Bd.\nAug. 29, 2003).  That Applicant may wish to keep his British citizenship out of respect for\n\n8\nhis family roots and heritage is not sufficient reason either to preclude him from mitigating\nsecurity concerns over his holding dual British citizenship.  \nWhole person precepts favor Applicant\u2019s preference for the U.S. over Great Britain.\nHe is a longtime resident of the U.S. (since 1976) and a naturalized U.S. citizen who has\nalways demonstrated his loyalty for the U.S.  His principal financial interests are situated\nin the U.S.  And, his wife and two children are all U.S. citizens: his children by birth and W\nby naturalization.\nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the U.S.  He satisfies his\nproof burden in several ways: demonstrated lack of any prior exercise of any privileges\nassociated with his British citizenship, save for his limited use of his British passport.\nApplicant absolves himself of foreign preference concerns and carries his evidentiary\nburden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his native country\n(Great Britain) or the country (U.S.) where he was naturalized.  Favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c of\nGuideline C.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in E 2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c: \nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

The third debt is to creditor #3 in the past due amount of about $4,357 (TR\nat page 33 lines 5~20, and GX 6 at page 2).  This debt is included in Applicant\u2019s\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy, as evidenced by its Schedule F at page 2.\n1.d.  The fourth debt is to creditor #4 in the past due amount of about $200 (TR\nat page 33 line 21 to page 34 line 4, and GX 8 at page 2).  This debt is included in\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, as evidenced by its Schedule F at page 2.\n\n3\n1.e.  The fifth debt is to creditor #5 in the past due amount of about $2,370 (TR at\npage 34 lines 5~14, and GX 8 at page 3).  This debt is included in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7\nBankruptcy, as evidenced by its Schedule F at page 3.\n1.f.  The last debt is to creditor #6 in the past due amount of about $1,037 (TR at\npage 34 lines 15~21, and GX 6 at page 3).  This debt is included in Applicant\u2019s Chapter\n7 Bankruptcy, as evidenced by its Schedule F at page 3.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.a.  The Applicant was less than candid when he answered Section 28 on his\nSeptember 2007 e-QIP (TR at page 38 line 7 to page 40 line 17, and GX 1 at pages\n30~31).  He checked the \u201cNo\u201d boxes, as to having any debts more that 90 or 180 days\npast due, in the last seven years ( GX 1 at pages 30~31).  He answered these\nquestions falsely, as he was in \u201c[f]ear of keeping his job\u201d (TR at page 39 lines 19~22).  I\nfind this to be a wilful falsification.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\n\n4\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  Applicant has at least five past due debts that\nhe has been unable to address in a timely fashion.  The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ The Applicant has included all of his alleged past due debts in\nhis filing for the protection of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  He is awaiting the probate of his\nmother-in-law\u2019s estate before this petition can be finalized.  If he and his spouse receive\n\n5\nmore than $50,000 from her estate, the petition will be dropped and the past due debts\nwill be paid.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nParagraph 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nDisqualifying Condition under Subparagraph 16(a) applies.  It provides that the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire . . . or similar form used to conduct investigations . . . \u201d may be\ndisqualifying.  I can find no countervailing Mitigating Condition here, as Applicant\nfalsified his e-QIP for fear of losing his job.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  His former supervisor speaks most\nhighly of the Applicant (AppX A).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his Personal Conduct. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",
