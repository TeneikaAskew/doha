On May 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as\namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant\nwhich detailed reasons under Guideline J Criminal Conduct and Guideline E Personal\nConduct why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn June 25, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a\nhearing. The matter was assigned to me on August 22, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on August 28, 2007, and amended on August 30, 2007, for a hearing on\nJanuary 16, 2008\n\n2\nSeptember 13, 2007, and held that day. The government offered eight exhibits and\nApplicant offered thirteen at the hearing. All were admitted into evidence. Applicant and\nhis wife testified. The transcript was received on September 21, 2007. On December\n18, 2007, I requested additional material from Applicant to clarify certain issues. Two\ndocuments were submitted on January 9, 2008, and accepted in evidence without\nobjection. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR on August 17, 2007, to add one\nnew allegation of an offense in 1994 under the Guideline J Criminal Conduct allegations\nand new Guideline G Alcohol Consumption allegations which corresponded to the\ncriminal allegations in the original SOR and the new amended allegation. Applicant was\ngiven one week in which to object to the SOR amendment. No objection was made and\nthe answers to the amended allegations were presented at the hearing. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted four of the original allegations under Guideline J relating to\ncriminal conduct between 1995 and 1998. He denied the fifth allegation (SOR \u00b6 1 c) and\nsupplied explanatory information for all. One allegation (SOR \u00b6 1 d) was amended at the\nhearing to show that all charges were dismissed. He admitted, with explanatory\ninformation, one allegation regarding erroneous information on his SF 86 under\nGuideline E relating to personal conduct. He admitted all of the new allegations under\nGuideline G relating to drinking alcohol at the time of the incidents which gave rise to\nthe criminal allegations under Guideline J. After a complete review of the record, I make\nthe following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee for the past 21 years of a major defense\ncontractor as a metrology technician. He has held a security clearance for 18 years (Tr.\n35). He is highly regarded for his work performance in statements and evaluations\nwhich were admitted into evidence (Exhs. B, C, and E-J). He holds an associate\u2019s\ndegree in his field of expertise. He served on active duty in the Marine Corps for four\nyears. \nDuring a period between 1994 and 1999, Applicant was alleged in the SOR to\nhave had four instances of criminal behavior relating to domestic violence one of which\nalso involved property damage. All of them involved his wife whom he married in 1992\n(Exhs. 2-7). The first was an arrest in 1994 (Exh. 3; Amended SOR \u00b6 1 f.) with no\nevidence as to the disposition (Tr. 35). The second arrest in 1995 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) resulted\nin a charge of assault/domestic violence. He was found guilty and sentenced to one\nyear of unsupervised probation and family counseling (Exhibit D). The third arrest in\n1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) was continued until 1998. The fourth allegation in 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1. c.)\nrelates to the same offense as the third arrest and was dismissed in 1998 (Exhibit E and\n\n3\nTr. 46). The last arrest for domestic violence, disorderly conduct, and property damage\nwas in 1999 (SOR \u00b6 l. d.). He was found not guilty and all charges were dismissed\n(Exhibits F, G, and H, and Tr. 47). This allegation was amended during hearing to\naccurately reflect the disposition of the case (Tr. 90). \nThus, there were four arrests for specific incidents and all of them concerned\ndifficulties Applicant and his wife were having. These problems were the result of her\nobsessive compulsive disorder leading to anxiety and depression which in turn led her\nto excessive drinking (Exh. A 2, and Tr. 23-24). He also had been drinking alcohol when\nall the offenses occurred (Tr. 63). When her problems first began in the early 1990's,\ndoctors were unable to adequately treat her and the medicine prescribed was not\nhelpful. She was hospitalized for 28 days in 1999 for alcohol treatment (Tr. 28). \nSince that time, the situation has greatly improved and she now is on an effective\nregimen of prescription medicine which has a remarkable effect in controlling her\nbehavior (Exh. A, and Tr. 49). She has been in psychiatric care at various times since\n1995 and is still under the occasional care of a psychiatrist. \nAs a result of the counseling Applicant and his wife have received, he also has\nlearned to cope with her difficulties and not react inappropriately. They are now very\nhappily married and have had no domestic difficulty since 1999 (Tr. 34). They have both\nreceived marital counseling (Tr. 68).\nThe last instance of criminal behavior was in 2004 in connection with the\noperation of a powerboat (Exh. 8). The circumstances of the arrest were that Applicant\nand his wife were in their boat on a lake near their home over Memorial Day weekend\non May 30, 2004, when he exceeded the speed in a \u201cno wake\u201d area of the lake, while\nreturning to the dock. When the water police stopped him they gave him a breathalyzer\ntest and he tested in excess of allowable limit for alcohol. He was charged with\noperating a boat under the influence of alcohol (OUI-Watercraft) with a BAC of .08, and\nExtreme OUI greater than .15 with two missing life preservers. On September 21, 2004,\nhe plead guilty to Extreme OUI. All other charges were dismissed. He paid a fine of\n$2,000, served ten days in jail with work release during the day, attended alcohol and\ndrug evaluation classes for 32 hours, and was placed on three years of unsupervised\nprobation (Exh. N 1). He also was required to attend a boating education course which\nhe did (Exh. I p. 4). \nThe treatment report made as a result of this offense revealed that he had high\nalcohol tolerance but had been legally intoxicated once or twice during the past month.\nThe substance abuse counselor found that he did not have a condition that could impair\njudgment or reliability, particularly in the context of safeguarding classified material\n(Exh. I p. 3). Applicant describes himself as a casual drinker and drinks only beer (Tr.\n66). \nOn December 28, 2004, Applicant advised the court that he had fulfilled all of the\nrequirements of the probation (Exh. N 2). He was still required to report any change of\n\n4\naddress or legal difficulties to the court, to refrain from drinking intoxicating liquor to\nexcess, and to refrain from drink while operating a boat. The probation ended on\nSeptember 21, 2007, and no such incidents had occurred.\nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 86 on November 5, 2005, he failed to list the\n1999 arrest for domestic violence (SOR \u00b6 1.d) at Question 23 (f): Your Police Record\nrelating to other charges, arrests, or convictions in the past seven years not listed in\nQuestion 23 (a.-d). The other domestic violence arrests were before the seven year\nperiod and not required to be listed (Tr. 72). Applicant mistakenly believed that since the\ncase was dismissed that it was not required to be listed. The 2004 felony for the boating\nincident was reported on his SF 86 at Question 23 as relating to being charged or\nconvicted of a felony.\nApplicant has two step-children of his wife\u2019s and two biological children from his\nformer marriage. All are of mature age. He has a stable family life. He is well regarded\nin his company for work performance and ethics (Exhs. K, L. and M), and has received\nnumerous awards for his effective services (Exh. B 1-6). His supervisors are aware of\nhis problems both domestically and his most recent arrest in 2004 (Tr. 58).\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to\ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access\nto such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). The\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, they recognize the\ncomplexities of human behavior, and are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2 c, the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2 b\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.).\nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\n\n5\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided\ndrawing inferences based on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15., the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nSecurity concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) relating to the four\narrests between 1994 and 1999 for Assault/domestic violence/ property damage and his\n2004 arrest for OUI raises security concerns since criminal activity creates doubt about\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, these arrests and the\nactions taken by the court calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying include a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses (AG \u00b6 31 a).\nMitigating conditions (MC) might apply if so much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgement (AG \u00b6 32 a). Another MC provides mitigation if there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, and a good\nemployment record (AG \u00b6 32 d). \nThe specific criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.-d. and f. relating to domestic\nviolence occurred eight to thirteen years ago under circumstances unlikely to recur.\nBecause of the successful treatment of his wife since 1999 and Applicant\u2019s own\n\n6\neducation about her problems and the alcohol treatment for 32 hours he has received, I\nconclude that both mitigating conditions are applicable to the offenses.\nThe final criminal allegation SOR \u00b6 1.e. concerning Operating under Influence\n(OUI) of a powerboat in 2004 is the most recent criminal conduct and resulted in the\nheaviest penalties imposed on Applicant of any of the offenses. However, from his\ntestimony and facts and circumstances of the punishment imposed particularly the\neducation requirements, I am confident that he has learned his lesson from the event\nand that it will not be repeated. I conclude that the mitigating conditions are applicable\nto that allegation as well. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report the 1999 arrest at Question 23 of his SF 86,\nprompted security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Such conduct might\nindicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation (AG \u00b6 15). Specifically, conditions that could raise a security concern and be\ndisqualifying include the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire (AG \u00b6 16 a).\nApplicant fully revealed the 2004 arrest on his SF 86. The 1999 domestic incident\nwas the only one of the domestic dispute issues that should have been reported, and he\nbelieved that since it had been dismissed which had in fact happened. I conclude that\nthe omission was not deliberate as the guideline requires, and Applicant credibly denied\nthat the omission was deliberate or made with intent to deceive. I conclude in favor of\nApplicant since the allegation was not proven. \nGuideline J, Alcohol Consumption\nThe government cited a disqualifying condition (DC) under the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol consumption\nunder Guideline G. The security concern is that excessive alcohol consumption leads to\nexercise of questionable judgment and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness (AG \u00b6 21). The specific concern is alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving or operating a boat while under the influence\n(AG \u00b6 22 a).\nPossible mitigating conditions (MC) might include the fact that so much time has\npassed, or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement (AG \u00b6 23\na), or the individual acknowledges issues of alcohol abuse provides evidence of actions\ntaken to overcome this problem and has established a pattern of responsible use (AG \u00b6\n23 b). The mitigating factors cited are applicable in view of the counseling and\neducation that occurred after the 2004 arrest as well as the testimony at the hearing.  \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an evaluation of whether the applicant meets\nthe security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct;\n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence (AG \u00b6.2.9). Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances of this case. In all adjudications the protection of our\nnational security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified\ninformation have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified\ninformation. The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the\ntotality of his acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis. \nApplicant has an excellent work record with the same employer and has held a\nsecurity clearance during most of the time of his employment. He has remained married\nthroughout the difficult period of his wife\u2019s medical problems and her treatment. He has\nlearned from his mistakes and learned to respond appropriately to his wife\u2019s medical\nproblems. He lives and works in a stable environment and is highly valued by his\nemployer. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of\nApplicant, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his\ncriminal and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR as\nrequired by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.f.:  For Applicant\nParagraph 2.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has had a history of financial difficulties. He has paid off or is paying the majority\nof his debts, and he has a plan to resolve any remaining overdue debt, that is not in dispute. His\nfinancial situation is stable and current. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated May 15, 2007, Applicant responded in writing to the\nSOR allegations (RSOR), and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.\nThe case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 29, 2007. A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued to the parties on August 20, 2007, and the hearing was held in Fairbanks, Alaska, on\nSeptember 25, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-7) and\nno witnesses were called. Applicant submitted five documentary exhibits (Exhibits A through E) and\noffered his own testimony. All documentary evidence was entered into evidence without objection.\nThe record was left open until October 5, 2007, to allow Applicant to introduce additional evidence\nof proof of payment of past overdue debts. Applicant timely offered into evidence a cover letter and\nadditional documents. Department Counsel indicated that he had no objection to these additional\nproffered documents; these documents are entered into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F. The\ntranscript (Tr) was received on October 10, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains 21 allegations, 1.a.\nthrough 1.u., under Guideline F. In his Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted SOR\nallegations 1.d., 1.e., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.n.,1.o., 1.p., 1.t., and 1.u., and he denied the other\nallegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\n \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is currently unmarried, and he has one 16 year old son.\nApplicant is employed as an Operations Manager by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. \nThe SOR lists 20 debts that Applicant allegedly owed as of either February 26, 2007, or April\n18, 2007, 1.a. through 1.t., under Adjudicative Guideline F.  The debts will be discussed in the order\nthat they were listed in the SOR: \n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $84. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit 7, a credit report from Equifax, dated September 20,\n2007, shows that this debt has been paid. \n\n3\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $4,321. This\nmedical debt arose because Applicant had wrist surgery, and he had difficulty having the insurance\ncompany pay the 80% that he believes it was required to pay. Applicant testified that this debt has\nnow been reduced to $866, because the insurance company has now paid its share. He has now\nformulated a payment plan with the collection agency, and is scheduled to pay $555.26 a month for\nthis debt and several others. Exhibit C shows that he has made two payments thus far. The other\ndebts that this payment covers will be discussed as the additional debts are reviewed. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $4,409. Applicant\nbelieves that this is the same debt as that listed in 1.b., above. Exhibit 7, the most current credit\nreport, does not list two separate debts in the amounts of 1.b. and 1.c. I cannot find that1.b. and 1.c.\nare two different debts. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $342. Applicant\ntestified that at this time he still owes this debt, but he is planning to resolve this debt by the end of\nthe year. \n1.e.

Applicant plans to\ntake the proceeds from this lawsuit if it is resolved favorably to pay this debt and some additional\ndebts. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $1,468. Applicant\ntestified that this medical bill was also never paid by his insurance company. It has been resubmitted\nto the insurance company, and he anticipates that 80% of the debt will be paid by the insurance\ncompany. After the hearing Applicant submitted Exhibit F and offered that the insurance company\nhas now paid $1,174.54, reducing the debt still owed to $293.64.This debt is also one that is being\nreduced by his monthly payment of $555.26, as discussed in 1.b., above. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $1,112. This bill\nfor an apartment lease has now been resolved. Exhibit B includes a letter from the attorneys who\nrepresented the creditor on this claim, which shows that this debt has been paid in full. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $325. This is an\nadditional debt that is being reduced by Applicant\u2019s  monthly payment of $555.26, as discussed in\n1.b., above. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $731. This hospital\nbill is also part of Applicant\u2019s slip and fall case, as is 1.g., above. \n1.j.

This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $159. Applicant\ntestified that at this time he still owes this debt, but he is planning to resolve this debt by the end of\nthe year. \n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $11. Applicant\nbelievers that he paid this bill in 1999 to a hospital, and it is not on his most current credit report.\n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $365. Applicant\ntestified that he has no information to dispute that he owes this bill to a cable company, and he plans\nto pay the debt after he confirms that the bill is correct. \n1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 15 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $46. Applicant\ncontacted the credit reporting agencies, but he has been unable to ascertain the origin of this bill.\nDepartment Counsel confirmed that this debt which arose in 2004 is no longer listed on the latest\ncredit report so it must be resolved since the debt is too recent to have been dropped off the credit\nreport after seven years. \n1.p. This overdue debt to Creditor 16 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $891. Applicant\ntestified that he paid $930 to resolve this debt, by fax on July 18, 2007. \n1.q.

This overdue debt to Creditor 19 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $615. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is for a university course that he took. He stated that he attempted to have the\ncollege reduce the debt, since he only attended three class sessions before he was forced to go in the\nhospital and drop the class, but they refused. He testified that he would pay off this debt, but it would\nbe the last one he resolved.  \n1.t. This overdue debt to Creditor 20 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $35. Applicant\ntestified that when he requested from the credit reporting agency background as to the origin of this\ndebt, it was dropped from his credit report. The latest credit report does not list this debt. \n1.u. Applicant prepared a Personal Financial Statement on March 13, 2007, (Exhibit 5) which\nindicates he has a monthly net remainder of $2,257, after expenses. The Government alleges that he\nshould have been able to resolve more of his debts.  Applicant testified that this Personal Financial\nStatement does not reflect the money that he has been paying for back taxes and $12,500 advance\nthat he received from his current employer to pay off additional debts. Applicant estimated that 90%\n\n5\nof his income, that does not go to supporting his son or him, goes to paying off his debts. He testified\nthat he has had additional debts that have not been listed on the SOR, including a debt of $1,800 that\nhe borrowed from a friend, and he has been paying these off as well. \nApplicant testified that as a resident of Alaska he will be receiving a dividend of $1,654 at\nthe end of 2007, and he is planning to use that to resolve as many additional debts as he can. \nApplicant  remains current on all his recent debts, including his two credit cards, and he has\ndemonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances.\nApplicant submitted a character letter from his current supervisor (Exhibit A). He spoke\nextremely highly of Applicant, talking about him being as an excellent worker and more significantly\nabout him working diligently to resolve his overdue debts, which occurred because of medical bills\nand because of the move of Applicant and his son from Wisconsin to Fairbanks, Alaska to obtain\nhis current employment.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n            Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish\nhis security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\ndemonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent\n\n6\nwith the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's\nfitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration\nof such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of\nrecurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has\na heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted\nby the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),\n\"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. This the\nApplicant has done.\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F: \nThe Government has established its initial case under Guideline F. The record evidence\nproves Applicant's history of indebtedness. However, there is evidence that Applicant is attempting\nto resolve these overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F in the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I conclude DC 19 (a) applies because of Appellant\u2019s \u201chistory of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nIn considering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) I find that MC 20. (b) applies because the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem of Applicant  were largely beyond his control, (in\nthis case medical emergencies, loss of employment, and the cost of moving to obtain new\nemployment), and Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. MC 20. (e) also applies,\nas Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the creditors.   I, therefore, hold Guideline F\nfor Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the  Directive are hereby\n\n7\nrendered as follows:\nFinancial Considerations,  Guideline F: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

Overall, he has reformed and demonstrated positive\nchanges in behavior to mitigate financial concerns.  He also established he had no intent to falsify\nhis security submission by his failure to detail all of his debts as he did not know about the judgment\nand did not understand the questions on late payments.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on May 2, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make\nthe preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial\n1\nConsiderations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 and over Personal Conduct (Guideline E) in paragraph\n2 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\n2\nthe Department of Defense to be effective September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer dated June 6, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing.  On June 25, 2007,  Department Counsel indicated the case was ready to\nproceed, and the matter was assigned to me on June 27, 2007. After a mutually convenient date for\nhearing was agreed to, a Notice of Hearing, issued on July 12, 2007, set the matter for August 1,\n2007, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.\n \nAt the hearing the Government offered seven exhibits  (Exhibit 1-7), which were admitted\ninto evidence. The Government noted that the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i. used the wrong figure; his\nmonthly net remainder was not $2,403 but $1,586; a technical amendment was made to amend and\ncorrect this error.  (TR 10; 132-133)\n Applicant was represented by a personal representative, a certified financial planner.\nApplicant testified, called one witness and offered five exhibits into evidence which were admitted\nas Exhibits A - E. I granted Applicant one week until August 8, 2007, to submit additional\nevidence; and the government one day to review it.  (TR 56-57, 104-105,126, 134)  Applicant\u2019s\nrepresentative submitted the additional evidence on August 8, 2007. (Exhibit F)  After Department\nCounsel responded on August 9, 2007, that he had no objection, the exhibit was admitted into\nevidence.  The record closed on August 9, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received on August 15,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 26 years old, began working for a defense contractor (Company #1) in State #1\nin July 2007.  While now operating under a new name, it is the same company where he worked\nwhen he provided his initial Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF\n86) to obtain a security clearance in October 2005.  Company #1 is again sponsoring him for a\nsecurity clearance.  He worked for another company (Company #2) for eighteen months from 2005\nto 2007. He had an interim clearance from 2005 to April 2007 when it was terminated for\njurisdictional reasons.  Before that he worked from October 2002 to 2005 as a senior network\nengineer for Company #1, which then operated under a different name. He previously worked as\na sales representative in 2002 for a few months; earlier in 2002 he had a temporary position.  He\nworked as an assistant manager in a store from 1999 to 2002.  He grew up on a farm and still helps\nhis parents with the farm work.  A high school graduate, he attended a trade school for one month\nin 2002.  (Exhibits 1; TR 19-24; 37-38, 73-74)  Applicant married in September 2006. (TR 29; 44;\n46-47)\nFinances and Personal Conduct\nIn response to questions on his financial record in Section 27 of the e-QIP, he failed to\ndisclose an unpaid judgment entered against him in 2002.  (SOR \u00b6 2.a.)  He denied any intent to\nfalsify as he stated he did not know of this judgment as he was not given notice and had not\nreviewed a credit report before completing this form. (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 87-91)  He first\nlearned of the judgment when his mortgage broker showed him the credit report in November\n2005.  (TR 91)\n In response to questions on his financial delinquencies in Section 27 of the e-QIP, he did\ndisclose one delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.f.), but he failed to disclose delinquencies to other creditors\nwho were over 180 days delinquent.  (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) or over 90 days delinquent.  (SOR \u00b6 2.c.)   He\ndenied any intent to falsify as he stated he did not fully understand the question. He did the\napplication on line and did not know anyone who could answer any of his questions and clarify the\nquestion.  (Answer, Exhibit 1; TR 87-88, 91-94) \nApplicant maintained that he answered the questions to the best of his ability as he did not\nknow about the judgment and did not understand what 90 and 180 days late meant and had no one\nto ask for a clarification.  (TR 35-36) He certified that his answers were true, complete and correct\nto the best of his knowledge and belief.  (Exhibit 1)\nInvestigation revealed a substantial number of debts.  (Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7) In response to\nan Interrogatory that questioned him about his debts and other matters, Applicant replied in March\n2007 that he had paid or was making payment arrangements for a majority of these overdue debts.\n(See chart below.)  He indicated he and his wife had net monthly income of approximately $5,000,\nexpenses of approximately $2,400 with  a net remainder of approximately$1,500 each month (SOR\n\u00b6 1.i.).  (Exhibit 3; TR 85-87)\n\n       The government conceded that SOR \u00b6 1.b and \u00b6 1.c. were the same debt.  (TR 116)\n3\n4\nThe SOR alleged seven  debts which totaled approximately $22,000.  (Two were duplicate\n3\nlistings.) He admitted in the past he lived beyond his means and was \u201cliving paycheck to paycheck\nwithout much thought of the future.\u201d  (Answer)  Applicant denied he remains indebted to any of\nthe creditors except for \u00b6 1.b., which is the same debt alleged in \u00b6 1.c., where he has made\narrangements to make monthly payments.

He\nbelieved she considered this\npayment a gift to him that he\nrepays by working at the\nfarm. (Answer; Exhibits 3,\n4, 5, 6; Exhibit A; TR 30;\n64-66)\n\n5\n1.g.\nConsumer debt for a\nphone when he was 18\nyears old, placed for\ncollection in 1999.\n$ 553.\nApplicant satisfied this debt\nin January  2007.

After examining his credit report for the first time, he\nrealized he could not get a mortgage in his name.  \nApplicant then consulted a certified financial planner for advice and assistance in\nDecember 2005 and had several counseling sessions with him; he still consults with him.\nUltimately, he and his wife were able to buy a home worth $231,000, but the mortgage is in her\nname; they settled on this property in January 2006.  (TR 26-28; 34; 43, 76, 81-82)  This home-\nbuying experience in 2006 was a catalyst for him to begin to change his financial practices. (TR\n76-81) \nHowever, he could not get a debt consolidation loan in his own name because of his bad\ncredit rating.  (TR 102-103)  Finally, in March 2007 his mother was able to get a home equity loan\nand agreed to make a personal loan to him of $12,000 to try to help him consolidate his debts.  He\nis making monthly payments of $400 to pay back the principle with no interest; his mother\ndocumented that he has consistently made these payments in May, June, and July 2007.   (TR 29,\n69-70, 73, 102-103; Exhibit F)  \nApplicant\u2019s wife manages the family finances as she is \u201ctons better\u201d with money. (TR 30)\nHe now invests more money in his 401k where he has $4,000 invested.  (TR 31) He has a passion\nfor cars and spent $9,000 on a car in 2006, which he paid off in 2007; he also just purchased a\n2000 truck in November 2006 and is making payments on that vehicle of $273 per month. (TR 34,\n82-83)  He has changed his ways and has learned better how to manage his money and to budget;\nhe has made timely payments on his truck and on his student loan.  (TR 75-76)  In August 2007\nthe budget reflected monthly income of approximately $5,300, monthly expenses of approximately\n$3,600, and a net remainder of approximately$1,500.  The expenses include a $400 monthly\npayment to Applicant\u2019s mother to repay the debt consolidation loan she gave him.  (Exhibit F)\nReferences\nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor, friend, and his roommate in 2002 and from 2003 to\nDecember 2005 testified on his behalf.  He supervised Applicant from March 2003 to March 2005\n\n6\nas they worked at the same organization.  As a roommate, Applicant paid all of his bills on time.\nThe supervisor assessed Applicant as one of the top five employees out of 55 he supervised.  (TR\n107-111, 112)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding\nwhether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the administrative\njudge considers the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case and weighs relevant revised\nAdjudication Guidelines: the mere presence or absence of any adjudication condition is not\ndecisive. \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate\npersuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.\nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended and revised, and the Directive, as\namended and revised, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made\nonly after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In\nreaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may\ndraw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence\nof record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to\nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is\nnot necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant. It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n \u00b6 18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it\nmay lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n       Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e) potentially apply: \n4\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\n      The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue\n5\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some\n7\nThe government established Applicant\u2019s financial problems, which were reflected  by his\naccumulating over $20,000 in debts, including a car repossession.  His financial problems began\nin 1999 and continued to 2007. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n(DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation  to overcome the case against him.  In large part,\n4\nApplicant\u2019s debts grew out of his immaturity, overspending on expensive vehicles and other items,\nand lack of understanding of finances, and his delay in finding a path to resolve his debts.  He\nlearned the significance of his bad credit when he was looking for a house to purchase and learned\nthat he could not get a mortgage in his name. At that point he started looking for a certified\nfinancial planner and found one to help him understand how to get control of his finances.\nApplicant and his wife were able to buy a home worth $231,000, with the mortgage in her name,\nin January 2006. \nTo his credit, after he received the Interrogatories in March 2007 and understood the\nsecurity significance of the delinquent debts, but before receiving the SOR in May 2007, Applicant\ntook positive and effective action. Unable to get a commercial loan with his bad credit, he\nconcluded that he needed to get a personal loan from his mother in order to begin to  resolve the\ndebts which she was willing to do in March 2007.  While his actions in then resolving a majority\nof his debts are recent, he was made consistent payments of $200 per month to his mother to repay\nthe interest-free $12,000 loan.\nWhile he initially showed unsound judgment in his delay in addressing these issues, he now\nhas initiated a conscientious plan.  He has already demonstrated an effective and consistent\napproach to resolving these debts.  He also has a plan to make  monthly payments for his\nrepossessed vehicle which shows his good faith  efforts to resolve this debt and set aside his claims\n5\n\nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not\ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence,\nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than\nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order\nto claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n8\nagainst the dealer.  Thus, he merits consideration under AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) because he took these steps\nto use legally available means to resolve his delinquent debt.  \nFurther, Applicant provided evidence under AG  \u00b6 20 (c), the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.  Even before he received the SOR, he initiated efforts to obtain\ncounseling for these financial problems with a certified financial planner who represented him at\nthe hearing.  Applicant has  made substantial steps to turn around his financial issues with the\nassistance of this financial planner, his mother\u2019s loan, and his wife financial management skills.\nThus, he has shown there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol.  He has only one debt he did not resolve: that was a small debt where he investigated and\nfound the company had no record; this debt (SOR 1.h.) he disputes as it no longer appears on his\ncredit report.  Also, AG \u00b6 20(a) also applies as the circumstances seem unlikely to recur given his\nmarriage and increased maternity.  He also has established a responsible work record per his\nformer supervisor. \nWhole Person Analysis\nEvaluating Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I conclude he is an earnest\nperson who demonstrated his initiative in developing a solution to his delinquent debt once he\nunderstood the security significance of his debts. He has been consistent in making three payments\nto his mother for the debt consolidation loan and has another monthly payment plan to resolve\nanother large debt for a repossessed vehicle.  Significantly, with his wife\u2019s help, he has changed\nhis financial practices and developed a budget.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress is slight as he has a stable and impressive employment history with the confidence of the\npast supervisor who testified for him.  Based on all of these positive steps, I conclude favorably\nfor him based on a whole person assessment.  He is earnestly working to resolve his financial\nproblems, so the likelihood of new debts and related problems is low. \nOverall, Applicant has established a substantial case in mitigation under AG  \u00b6 20 , but\nsince his reform and repayment efforts are so recent, I also assess him as a whole person and\nconclude that the security concerns are mitigated under that analysis. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has  mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial\nconsiderations.  I rule for  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i. under SOR Paragraph 1.\n\n      See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n6\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\nGuideline E:  Personal Conduct\n\u00b6 15. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and a\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  \nApplicant denies he had any intent to falsify by not including all of his debts on the security\nform.  He did not review a credit report that would have listed all his debts and was not given\nnotice of his adverse judgment.  I found his explanation that he did not understand 90 to 180 days\nlate in making payments was credible as he did list one overdue $2,200 debt from 2001 (SOR 1.f.).\nWhile he admits he was rushed in completing the form, he did reveal one debt; thus he did not try\nto hide his financial problems.  Also, he had no easy resource to ask for clarification as he\ncompleted the form on line.  Given his candor and willingness to supply adverse information to\nother questions, I conclude that it was not his intent to falsify by omitting his other debts.  An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred.   Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of him as a whole\n6\nperson, I conclude  Guideline E  in favor of Applicant. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person as discussed above, I conclude he has refuted\nthe security concerns pertaining to personal conduct.  I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a.\nthrough 2.c. under SOR Paragraph 2.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nin Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.c.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n10\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 6, \n2006. On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 11, 2007. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October \n15, 2007. The case was transferred to me on November 1, 2007. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on November 13, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nDecember 11, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on January 4, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until January 2, 2008, to submit additional matters. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for an extension until January 7, 2008. Applicant timely submitted AE D which \nwas admitted. The record closed on January 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, the Government motioned to amend the SOR by \nwithdrawing SOR \u00b6 1.b.  There being no objection SOR \u00b6 1.b was withdrawn. (Tr at 9.) \nAll remaining SOR allegations were not renumbered.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 5, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c and denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.b,1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g.   \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old systems engineer employed by a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking to maintain his security clearance.  He has held a security \nclearance for approximately 30 years.  He served on active duty in the Air Force for 20 \nyears, retiring at the grade of E-5.  He has worked for the same defense contractor for \nten years after retiring from the Air Force. He is a high school graduate but is taking \ncourses in information technology with an online university. (Tr at 4-6; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant is married. He supports his wife, a 27-year-old daughter and her seven- \nyear-old daughter, and a 13-year-old son. (Tr at 15, 32-33.) He also has a 29-year-old \nson who is on active duty in the Air Force.(Tr at 49.) Applicant has always lived from \npay check to pay check. (Tr at 55.)  His financial problems started in 2000 when his wife \nwas no longer able to work due to health problems.  Applicant also has health problems. \nThe medical costs made it difficult to pay their debts. His wife was denied social security \nbenefits. (Tr at 15-16; Answer to SOR; see also AE C.) Applicant provided a list of his \nand his wife\u2019s prescription medications. (AE B.) A current budget submitted during the \nhearing, indicates that Applicant pays approximately $450 monthly in medical/dental \nexpenses. (AE A.) \n \nOn July 18, 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. He listed total \nassets of $7,580 and total liabilities of $76,305.76. (Gov 5; Gov 6.) He made payments \non the Chapter 13 plan for at least six months.  Applicant found it difficult paying \nexpenses after making Chapter 13 payments. (Tr at 40-41.)  As a result, he converted \nhis bankruptcy from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 on February 21, 2007.  At the time of the \nfiling for Chapter 7, he listed assets of $4,163 and liabilities of $96,042. (Gov 7.)  His \ndischargeable debts were discharged on June 11, 2007. (Answer to SOR.)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant listed three unsecured priority claims with the Internal Revenue Service \n(I.R.S.) in schedule E of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He owed a total of $6,835 in income \ntaxes for tax years, 2002, 2003, and 2004. In schedule F of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, \nhe listed five claims for federal income taxes owed for tax years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 \nand 2001.  The total amount of the taxes owed for these years was $8,850. (Gov 7.) \nThe total amount of the tax debt included in the bankruptcy is $15,685.  The total \namount of consumer debt listed in the bankruptcy is approximately $62,608.  Of that \namount, $14,125 is a student loan account. The total amount of medical debt included \nin the bankruptcy is $19,200.03. (Id.)  Federal income tax debts and student loan debts \nare not usually discharged in bankruptcy. (See 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(1) and 11 U.S.C. \n523(a)(8).)       \n \nApplicant owed income taxes for taxes 1997 \u2013 2004 because he did not elect to \ntake the deduction upfront out of his military retirement check.  When he filed his tax \nreturns, he did not have the money to pay the amount of taxes owed. He made some \npayments and claims that some of the tax debts were discharged in bankruptcy. (Tr at \n30-31, 51; see also 11 U.S.C. 507(a)(8)(A).)  \n \nAt hearing, when asked whether he owed any money to the federal or state \ngovernment for unpaid taxes, he replied that he will not owe any taxes until the end of \nthe year. (Tr at 31.)  He anticipates that he will owe between $2,400 to $2,500.  He \nowed $2,500 for tax year 2005 and makes monthly payments but has not totally paid off \nthe balance. He is not sure what the balance is. He claims that it is being automatically \ndeducted from his paycheck.  He intends to enter into a payment arrangement with the \nI.R.S. for the taxes that will be due this year. He is not willing to have the taxes \nautomatically deducted from his military retirement check because that is what he uses \nto pay rent. (Tr at 46.) He claims all taxes owed were discharged in the bankruptcy \nexcept for tax years 2004 and 2005.  He currently has a payment agreement with the \nIRS and was advised to submit a copy of the payment agreement after the hearing. (Tr \nat 51.)     \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a copy of a paycheck dated December 24, \n2007.  The paycheck listed two garnishments.  Neither garnishment currently has \nmoney deducted from his paycheck. The first garnishment deducted a total of $675 for \nthe year. Applicant indicated that this is the I.R.S garnishment. He claims the second \ngarnishment with total of $550 deducted for the year is related to his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy.  In his explanation letter, dated January 7, 2008, Applicant claims that both \nof these payments were stopped when he converted to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (AE \nD at 1-2.) He recently took out a 401K loan in order to pay his tax debt. (Id.) However, \nhe did not provide a copy of a formal payment agreement with the I.R.S. or anything \nwhich indicates the status of his tax debts.     \n \nOn February 6, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to update his security clearance. (Gov 1.)  A \nMarch 7, 2006, credit report listed numerous delinquent debts, many of which were later \ndischarged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Gov 4.)  On July 6, 2007, another \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncredit report was obtained.  It listed the following delinquent accounts: a $65 delinquent \nphone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $486 medical collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $414 medical \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $440 medical collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and a \n$546 collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.g). (Gov 3.) \n \nApplicant provided proof that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, the $65 phone bill, \nwas resolved. (Tr at 19-20; AE D at 4.) He claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.g \nare medical bills that were turned over for collection.  Applicant claims that either he or \nhis wife contacted each collection agency and they have no records indicating that they \nowe anything.  He has taken no action to dispute these accounts on his credit report. (Tr \nat 25-27; Answer to SOR.)  All of these account became delinquent prior to Applicant\u2019s \nChapter 13 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Gov 3 and Gov 4.) Applicant thinks these \naccounts might have been included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy because none of the \ncompany\u2019s have information indicating they owe them money. (Tr at 50.)  \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and 1.e have the same account number. They \nappear to be duplicate entries of the same account. (Gov 2 at 1-18 and 1-19; Gov 3 at \n2.)  I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b61.e for this reason.  I also find for Applicant \nwith respect to SOR \u00b61.f which is a $440 medical account because it is listed in \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Gov 7 at 9; AE A at 1-19; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 5.) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.g is an account related to an automobile loan rather than a \nmedical account. (Gov 2 at 1-19; Gov 4 at 4.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual income is $52,000. In addition, he receives a monthly \nmilitary retirement check of $1,030, and works a part-time job on the weekends that \nbrings in about $500 a month. (Tr at 34-35, 47, 53.) Applicant\u2019s current budget lists that \nhe has approximately $4,530 in total monthly income.  His total monthly expenses are \napproximately $4,200, leaving him approximately $330 in discretionary income. (AE A.) \nHe has one open credit card account that has a balance of $250.  The maximum on the \naccount is $250.  He makes the minimal payments of $20 a month. (Tr at 27-29; AE D \nat 1.) Applicant\u2019s health insurance policy is with a private insurance company.  When \nasked whether he uses any medical benefits he is eligible for as a military retiree, he \nclaimed he had very limited benefits. He is not sure which insurance company is taking \ncare of the medical bills because he never sees any of them. (Tr at 49-50.)  \n \nHis most recent performance appraisal which closed out on June 30, 2007, \nindicates that he meets or exceeds standards. (AE D at 5-12.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC & 19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. He has a history of not meeting financial \nobligations which ultimately resulted in his filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February \n2007.  He listed approximately $96,000 in liabilities in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He \nadmits that he was unable to pay much of the debt. \n \nFC DC \u00b619(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis) applies.  Although Applicant and his wife \nincurred medical expenses related to their health condition, the majority of the debt \nlisted on his Chapter 7 bankruptcy was consumer debt, totaling $62,608.  The medical \nbills included in the bankruptcy totaled, approximately $19,200.  Applicant continued to \naccumulate debt after he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. When he filed the Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, he had a negative monthly balance of $488.50 which indicates living \nbeyond one\u2019s means. (AE 7 at 19.)     \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged in bankruptcy just six months prior to the hearing. \nNot enough time has passed to conclude Applicant is on the path of financial stability. \nUnder bankruptcy law, tax debts and student loans are usually not considered \ndischargeable.  Although the Government did not allege Applicant\u2019s tax debts and \nstudent loan in the SOR, they are listed in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy and raise a concern \nwhen considering the mitigation of Applicant\u2019s case. He has failed to provide sufficient \ninformation to support that these debts were discharged in bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s \nbudget indicates that after monthly expenses, he has $330 remaining in discretionary \nincome. An unexpected expense could result in continuing financial problems. In \naddition, Applicant has been unable to pay the amount of federal income taxes owed \nsince 1997. This problem could be prevented if Applicant were to change his deduction \non his military retirement check to have the taxes deducted. Instead, every year, it is \nlikely that he will have a tax debt that he owes the IRS. Questions remain about \nApplicant\u2019s financial judgment.  \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to the medical \nexpenses incurred as a result of Applicant and his wife\u2019s health problems. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation became more troublesome in 2000, after his wife was no longer able \nto work due to her health condition.  However, I give less weight to this mitigating \ncondition because I cannot conclude that Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Aside from the medical bills, Applicant and his wife had a substantial \namount of consumer debt which indicates a lack of fiscal restraint. An additional issue \nare the federal tax debts incurred by Applicant from 1997 to present. These debts could \nhave been prevented by changing the deduction pertaining to his military retirement \ncheck.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  Applicant attended one financial counseling session one month \nprior to his hearing. Given his history of financial irresponsibility additional counseling \nwould be helpful to assist him with a plan to avoid financial problems in the future. \nAlthough the majority of his debts were discharged in his bankruptcy, a question \nremains about the federal tax debt.  At the close of the record, the amount of taxes \nactually owed to the IRS is uncertain. I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are under control due to the recency of the bankruptcy discharge and the fact \nthat Applicant\u2019s budget indicates that he still lives paycheck to paycheck. \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, in part. Bankruptcy is a legitimate way to \nresolve one\u2019s debts. However, the burden was on Applicant to demonstrate that he has \na plan in place to establish a track record of financial stability. It is too soon to conclude \nsuch, based on the fact that his expenses remain almost equal to his income. Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the issue pertaining to his delinquent tax \ndebts.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held a security \nclearance for the past 30 years without incident.  I have considered his military service \nand his favorable performance report.  While some of the debt was incurred due to \ncircumstances beyond his control, the record does not establish that Applicant took \npreventive action to control his expenses. It is also unclear what steps he intends to \ntake in the future.  Most problematic, is the ongoing issue with his federal income taxes. \nAside from his own assertions, Applicant has provided no corroboration regarding the \nstatus of his past tax debts.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 47 years old and married. He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Professional Aeronautics and Business Management. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Safety Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant joined the Navy on January 16, 1978, at the young age of seventeen. He had a stellar military career as an enlisted man and retired as a Senior Chief E-8. He married his wife in 1996. Following his military retirement, he began working for a defense contractor. In 2004, while employed with the defense contractor, the Applicant was offered a promotion that required that he move from Washington state to New York. The Applicant decided to accept the opportunity and moved his family to New York. He put his house in Washington up for sale and purchased a house in New York. He took a loan out on his house in Washington to use as a down payment for the new house in New York. By the time he moved his family to New York he was already $30,00",

On August 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance \nshould be denied or revoked. \n \n \n1\n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 5, 2007, and \nrequested a hearing before DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the \nundersigned on November 1, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 29, \n2007, scheduling the hearing for December 14, 2007.  At the hearings the Government \npresented eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8.  The Applicant \n\n \n2\npresented eight exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H.  The Applicant \ncalled three witnesses to testify.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official \ntranscripts (Tr.) were received on January 2, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nThe Applicant is 47 years old and married.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in \nProfessional Aeronautics and Business Management.  He is employed by a defense \ncontractor as a Systems Safety Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance \nin connection with his employment. \n \n \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the \nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings \nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)   \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he \nis financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nThe Applicant joined the Navy on January 16, 1978, at the young age of \nseventeen.   He had a stellar military career as an enlisted man and retired as a Senior \nChief E-8.  He married his wife in 1996.  Following his military retirement, he began \nworking for a defense contractor.  \n \n \nIn 2004, while employed with the defense contractor, the Applicant was offered a \npromotion that required that he move from Washington state to New York.  The \nApplicant decided to accept the opportunity and moved his family to New York.  He put \nhis house in Washington up for sale and purchased a house in New York.  He took a \nloan out on his house in Washington to use as a down payment for the new house in \nNew York.  By the time he moved his family to New York he was already $30,000 in \ndebt.  Although he was offered some moving expenses from his employer, the entire \nmove cost him $55,000 out of pocket that was not reimbursed.  The Applicant soon \nlearned that the housing market in New York was almost three times more expensive \nthan the housing market in Washington state. After purchasing his house in New York, \nhe took out loans to get the house in order.  He determined that the house was not large \nenough and so he put it up for sale and moved into a larger house in New York.  He \nwas unable to sell the first house as the housing market in New York had taken a nose \ndive since he purchased it, and so he owed more on it than what he could sell it for.  \nThis house is now in foreclosure.  Frustrated by the situation and unsure of what else to \ndo, the Applicant left his family and his second house in New York and moved to \nCalifornia where he believed the cost of living would be better.  Upon returning to \nCalifornia, he lived in a rented trailer in an RV park.  His wife and children remained in \nNew York with the hopes of selling their second house.  The Applicant finally moved his \nfamily to California to join him even though their second house in New York did not sell.  \nThis house is also currently in foreclosure. \n\n \n3\n \n \nThis entire fiasco caused the Applicant to become seriously and delinquently \nindebted.  So deeply indebted that he could no longer afford to pay his bills and recently \nincurred debts on a regular monthly basis.  The Applicant\u2019s income and expenses were \nunstable due largely to this move.  In an effort to resolve his indebtedness, he decided \nthat his only reasonable choice was to file Bankruptcy.  Understanding that he had a \nmoral obligation to pay his bills, on December 5, 2006, the Applicant filed for bankruptcy \nunder Chapter 13.  On May 8, 2007, the petition was confirmed by the court.  Under the \ninitial terms of the Bankruptcy, the Applicant is required to pay $1,361.00 per month for \na period of five years.  The Applicant testified that the court order was recently modified \nwhich suspended three months of the payment and changed the monthly payments to \n$1,200.00 per month which will increase incrementally over time.  (Tr. p. 64 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  Since January 2007, the Applicant has been making payments \nunder this Bankruptcy plan.  (Tr. p. 116 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).    \n \n \nThe Applicant admitted and the documentary evidence supports the fact that the \nApplicant is indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR.  (See Government \nExhibits 5,6, 7 and 8).  The Applicant further stated and the documentation supports the \nfact that each of the debts listed in the SOR have been included in the Applicant\u2019s \nChapter 13 Bankruptcy petition and are scheduled to be paid within the next five years \nunder the plan confirmed by the court.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 4 and Government \nExhibit 1).  The following debts, mainly credit card debt, are included in the Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy petition:  A debt owed to Chase in the amount of $28,000.00, a debt owed \nto Bank of America in the amount of $42,449.00, a debt owed to Bethpage Federal \nCredit Union in the amount of $8,356.00,a debt owed to Capitol One in the amount of \n$12,736.00, a debt owed to American Express in the amount of $5,057.00, a debt owed \nto Bank of America in the amount of $3,612.00, a debt owed to Capitol One Bank in the \namount of $809.0, a debt owed to GEMB.Old Navy in the amount of $1,237.00, a debt \nowed to GEMB/PC $62.00, and a debt owed to AT&T Universal/Citibank in the amount \nof $2,115.00.   \n \n \nThe debts owed to Indymac Bank in the amount of $566,000.00, and a debt \nowed to Special Loan Services in the amount of $116,000.00, are for home loans that \nare presently in foreclosure or subject to short sale. \n \n \nDuring his military career the Applicant received five good conduct medals.  \nApproximately sixteen of the twenty years spent in the Navy, the Applicant held a Top \nSecret security clearance and never had a security violation. \n \n \nThe Applicant was asked if he was given a million dollars to pay off all of his \ndebts and his family could live in a nice house again, in exchange for divulging \nclassified information, would he agree to it.  The Applicant stated, \u201cEven if \u2013 you said \nforeign spy \u2013 you didn\u2019t even have to say that.  There is - - I learned from my parents \nthere is no easy answer to anything.  You know, even if I won the lotto tomorrow and \nthere wasn\u2019t you or anybody else, there is no easy answer.  You have to pay the piper.  \nThere has to be something that comes out.  A foreign spy - - answering that - - being \n\n \n4\nwhoever it is, even if unbeknownst to me, it is a foreign spy, there is no easy answer \nand to betray my country, to betray my friends, it will never happen.\u201d  (Tr. pp. 128-129).  \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife, father and step daughter testified on his behalf.  They have \nstrong feelings of affection and respect for the Applicant.  They consider the Applicant to \nbe a good American, who is responsible, polite, reliable, respectful and trustworthy.  \nThey highly recommend him for a position of trust.         \n \n \nLetters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from his \nmanager, professional colleagues, coworkers and friends attest to his ethical, \nconscientious, honest, dependable, reliable, hard working nature.  The Applicant is \nknown for his outstanding attitude, patriotic nature, integrity and loyalty.  He is highly \ntrusted and respected by all.  He is considered a dedicated professional in every sense \nof the word and highly recommended for a position of trust.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, \nB and C). \n \n \nThe Applicant has received numerous awards, commendations and letters of \nappreciation for his invaluable technical support in the defense industry.  (See \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors \nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case: \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds.  \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern: \n \n \n19.  (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n19.  (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \n19. (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to - income ratio, and \nother financial analysis. \n \n \n\n \n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n \n \n20.  (b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n20.  (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n \n \n20.  (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in \nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should \nconsider the following general factors: \n \n \na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances \n \n \nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation \n \n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct \n \n \nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct \n \n \ne. The voluntariness of participation \n \n \nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior \nchanges \n \n \ng. The motivation for the conduct  \n \n \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress \n \n  \ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal \ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, \nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. \n \n \nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted \nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person \nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative \nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical \nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions \nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized \nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to \ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information \ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore \nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for \nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates \npoor judgment or unreliability. \n \n \nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support \nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the \nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then \nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation \nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant \nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his a security clearance. \n \n \nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the \nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of \nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or \nconnection with his security clearance eligibility. \n \n \nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive \nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the \nGovernment's case.  With respect to his poor financial situation, the Applicant became \nseriously indebted as a result of a series of poor decisions that snowballed and \nnegatively impacted his finances.  In an effort to improve his financial situation, by \ntaking a job promotion, he fell deeper and deeper into debt.  He obviously failed to \nconsider the vast difference in the cost of living in New York and the other expenses \nand unfortunate things that could come along with such a move.  In addition several \nunfortunate circumstances beyond his control caused more financial difficulties, namely \nhis inability to sell his house in Washington state.  Despite this, in an effort to resolve his \nfinancial indebtedness he has filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and has been paying the \ntrustee under the plan since January 2007.  Under the circumstances, he has made a \ngood faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nrehabilitation.  He is paying his delinquent debts and plans to continue to pay them on a \nmonthly basis until they are paid off.  He is also current with his regular monthly \nexpenses.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial \naffairs.   \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligation;\u201d and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ration, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for \nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control and 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).   \n \n \nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case, I have also \nconsidered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The Applicant is 47 years of age and has no \nsecurity violations what so ever.  He has an impressive military record and extensive \nexperience and education in the field of engineering.  Over the past several years, he \nhas unfortunately encountered bad luck along with making bad decisions that have \nnegatively impacted his finances.  This past year, he has worked hard to resolve his \ndelinquent indebtedness, by filing Chapter 13 and following the trustee\u2019s payment plan.  \nHe plans to continue this until all of his delinquent debts are satisfied.  Considering all of \nthe facts and circumstances, I find that he has mitigated the concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \nI have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the appropriate \nfactors and guidelines in the Directive.  I have carefully considered the Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and his documentary evidence.  On balance, I conclude that his mitigating \nevidence is sufficient to overcome the evidence of unreliability and unsuitability for a \nsecurity clearance.  Therefore, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant him a security clearance.   \n \n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's \ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports \na finding for the Applicant as to the factual allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 for the \nGovernment's Statement of Reasons. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as \nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1: For the Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.a: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.b: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.c: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.d: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.e: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n                          Subpara.  1.f: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.g: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.h: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.i: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.j: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.k: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.l: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.m: \nFor the Applicant. \n   \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nDarlene Lokey-Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 26 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of illegal\ndrug use.  He answered the SOR 16 May 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case\n1\nto me 22 June 2007, and I convened a hearing 2 August 2007. DOHA received the transcript 15\nAugust 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 23-year-old civil engineer employed by a defense contractor since August\n2006\u2014seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.\nApplicant has a history of marijuana use between September 1999 and July 2006. He first\nstarted using marijuana in September 1999, during his sophomore year in high school. Between\nSeptember 1999 and November 2000, he estimates he used marijuana about 25 times in social\nsettings with his friends. Marijuana was always offered to him. He never purchased or sold it. After\nNovember 2000, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use dropped off sharply, if not ceasing altogether, during the\ntime he was participating in varsity sports in a school district that randomly tested its athletes for\nillegal drug use. He tested negative on two or three random urinalyses (Tr. 37).\nBetween 2001 and July 2006, Applicant estimates he used marijuana about once per year in\nsocial settings, usually with members of his fraternity. There were also occasions where he was\noffered marijuana in social settings, but declined. The last time he used marijuana was July 2006,\nwhile on what fairly is described as the grand tour of Europe after graduating from college. Between\nJune and August 2006, Applicant visited 14 European countries. While in Holland\u2014a country which\nhas decriminalized if not legalized marijuana use\u2014Applicant used marijuana in a youth hostel where\nhe was staying. His next most recent marijuana use was September 2005, the fall of his senior year\nin college. In high school and college, he never used marijuana alone, only in groups.\nApplicant interviewed with his current employer in fall 2005, and later that fall was offered\na position to begin in August 2006, in a state different both from where he attended college and from\nwhere he grew up.  He assumed the company would have a drug policy prohibiting  illegal drug use\n(Tr. 34). When he applied for his clearance in March 2007, he truthfully disclosed the full extent of\nhis drug use between September 1999 and July 2006 (G.E. 1). He also disclosed potentially adverse\ninformation about receiving mental health treatment while in college, even though that treatment\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nconsisted of three visits to the mental health clinic undertaken largely out of curiosity about what\nservices were available\u2014and because the services were free. In his March 2007 answer to DOHA\ninterrogatories (G.E. 2), he provided certification from the chief of that mental health clinic that he\ndid not suffer from any condition raising security concerns. He also stated that he had ceased using\nmarijuana because it was unhealthy, illegal, and detrimental to work productivity.\nApplicant testified credibly at hearing, and consistently with both his clearance application\nand his answer to interrogatories, that he has very little contact with his high school and college\nfriends with whom he used marijuana. He is more settled and focused on his career. He has been\npromoted at work. His social time is spent with young professionals who share similar career goals.\nMarijuana use is not part of that culture, and is viewed as immature.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline H (Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAny drug abuse [\u00a7 25.(a)];\n3\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\n4\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment [\u00b6\n26.(a)][Emphasis supplied];\nA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: . . . (2) changing or avoiding the\n5\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; . . . [\u00b6  26.(b)].\n4\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by demonstrating\nthat Applicant used marijuana in varying frequency between September 1999 and July 2006.3\nNevertheless, the arc of that drug use was heavier between his sophomore and junior years in high\nschool, with a sharp decline in frequency from 2001 until July 2006. His use over his last five years\nof use is fairly described as casual and infrequent, limited to his college environment or his grand\ntour of Europe, which I consider part and parcel of that college experience. Applicant thus mitigates\nthe security concerns, by demonstrating that the use was infrequent and under circumstances unlikely\nto recur,  and further demonstrating intent to not abuse drugs in the future.  His high school use was\n4\n5\nwith the friends he grew up with. His college use was with the friends he went to college with. But\nwhen he moved to a new state to begin his professional career, he realized it was time to put away\nchildish things. While Applicant\u2019s use is fairly characterized as \u201crecent,\u201d this term has less meaning\nunder the new adjudicative criteria, where the corresponding language \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago. . .\u201d [\u00b6 26.(a)], is used in the disjunctive with language that clearly applies to Applicant.\nFurther, while his abstention from marijuana use for only a year might not necessarily constitute an\nappropriate period of abstinence, given the minimal marijuana use by Applicant and his change in\nenvironment\u2014both physical (new state) and psychological (career versus school)\u2014I conclude that\na year\u2019s abstinence is appropriate [\u00b6 26.(b)]. On this record, it is extremely unlikely that Applicant\nwould return to illegal drug use. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 30 years old and employed by a federal contractor. He accumulated a number\nof debts over the past eight or nine years that he has not resolved or paid. Some of the debts are owed\nto the court for numerous traffic citations and a minor criminal offense. He failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by financial considerations and criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nThe individual Items are marked as Government Exhits (GX).\n1\n2\nOn July 20, 2006, Applicant electronically submitted a security clearance application (SCA).\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 25, 2007, detailing the basis for its\ndecision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (Guidelines) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 25, 2007, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the written record. On July 17, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM), containing seven Items, and mailed it to Applicant.  He received it on July 30,\n1\n2007, and had 30 days to file additional materials, which he declined to do. On September 14, 2007,\nthe case was assigned to me.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to all of the\nallegations in the SOR, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 30 years old. He is single and has three children whom he supports along with\nhis fianc\u00e9. In April 2006, he began his current position as an alarm monitor/drafter for a federal\ncontractor. He applied for a SCA in July 2006. (GX 4).\nApplicant admitted that he filed for bankruptcy twice. In April 2000, he filed a Chapter 7\nBankruptcy in which he listed assets of $1,215 and liabilities of $6,192. The following August, the\ncourt discharged his liabilities. In January 2001, he filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, listing assets of\n$1,215 and liabilities of $2,847. In July 2002, the court dismissed the bankruptcy. \nIn May 2000, the police arrested Applicant and charged him with Theft, 3  degree, for\nrd\nleaving a restaurant without paying the bill. He pled guilty and the court fined him $250, which\nremains unpaid. From 1998 through December 2003, he accumulated approximately $6,000 in fines\nfor traffic violations that remain unpaid. He has been unable to pay those fines due to his previous\nlimited income. He hopes to pay them as soon as his fianc\u00e9 obtains a job. (GX 5 at 3).\nBased on his SCA, responses to Interrogatories (GX 5), February and April 2007 credit\nreports (GX 7 and 8), and his answers to the SOR, Applicant owes about $7,116 to various creditors\nand $6,250 to the court. In his SCA, he indicated that he intended to dispute the debts listed in \u00b6 1.f\nand \u00b6 1.g. (GX 4 at 42 and 44). He stated he \u201cwas in the process of paying off everything\u201d he owed\nand intended to use a settlement from an accident to help pay the debts. (Id. at 49). He did not\nprovide any documentation to prove that he disputed or paid any debts, including the fines. To-date,\nall of the debts listed in the SOR are unresolved.\nIn May 2007, Applicant submitted a budget with his response to the Interrogatories. His net\nmonthly income is about $3,200 and expenses are $2,900, leaving him approximately $300 that\n\n3\ncould be used to reduce his delinquent obligations. (AX 5 at 7). Although he listed his outstanding\nstudent loan on the budget, he did not list any of the debts noted in the SOR.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . .  that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at\n527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an administrative judge\nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation.\u201d The revised Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nIn addition to evaluating those disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires a thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is known as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. Guideline \u00b6 2(c). Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\n\n4\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports, the Government raised potential\ndisqualifications under Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (\u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d), and FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d). Applicant admitted responsibility for the delinquent debts listed in the SOR and\nacknowledged he has not had the resources to manage his debts from approximately 1998 to the\npresent. After the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying conditions,\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate or rebut the allegations. \nFive Financial Considerations\u2019 Mitigating Condition (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved\nor is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline \u00b6 20(a) does\nnot apply. Applicant\u2019s problems date back to 1998, include the filing of two bankruptcies and the\ndischarge of $6,000 of debt, and continue into the present. The financial problems span an eight or\nnine year period and there is no evidence that they are being resolved. All of these facts cast doubt\non Applicant\u2019s reliability and good judgment. Applicant did not submit any information to support\nthe application of Guideline \u00b6 20(b). Nor did he produce documentation indicating that he received\nfinancial counseling, such that the problems are being resolved or under control, as required by\nGuideline \u00b6 20(c). He did not provide any evidence to establish that he made a good-faith effor to\n\n5\nresolve any debt under Guideline \u00b6 20(d). Although he stated he intended to dispute two debts, he\nfailed to produce evidence that he filed a dispute, hence, Guideline \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 30, \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nOne Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) could raise a security concern and\nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 31(a).\nApplicant admitted that from May 1998 through December 2003, he accumulated a number of fines\nrelated to traffic violations and that in May 2000, he was arrested for Theft, 3  Degree, to which he\nrd\nlater plead guilty. The Government produced substantial evidence of that CC DC, and the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence of a mitigating condition.\nTwo Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) under Guideline \u00b6 30 are potentially\napplicable:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nAlthough Applicant was arrested and convicted in May 2000, seven years ago, he has\nreceived traffic citations that span May 1998 through December 2003. Based on the ongoing nature\nof those traffic offenses for more than five years, sufficient time has not elapsed under Guideline \u00b6\n30(a), and his good judgment remains in question. Guideline \u00b6 30(d) does not apply because he has\nnot paid the $6,000 in fines, which would demonstrate some rehabilitation, nor submitted any\nevidence of a good employment record, completion of his education, constructive community\ninvolvement, or even remorse for his multiple criminal infractions, regardless of their nature.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I considered the\ntotality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including Applicant\u2019s age and his\ncandid disclosure of his numerous debts, and unpaid fines. I also took into account the fact that the\ndebts and traffic violations were the result of voluntary behaviors. I reviewed his current budget and\nnoted the lack of provisions for repayment of his delinquent debts, despite being aware of the\nproblem since the time he completed a SCA in July 2006 or responded to the Interrogatories in May\n2007. Without an established budget and a track record of consistent financial management\n\n6\ndemonstrating reliability and maturity, I am concerned that his financial problems will recur. Until\nhe pays his traffic fines, I cannot find that he has sufficiently rehabilitated himself or shown a\ncommitment to exercising trustworthiness, reliability or good judgment. Accordingly, Guidelines\nF and J are found are found against him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.j: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Per Se\n______________\nAmended Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 30, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on January 29, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 29, 2008, for the purpose\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 11 exhibits.\nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n2\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on February 6, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file,. pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her payments of several of her medical and consumer\ncreditors and efforts to contact listed creditors she cannot identify as her own.  For good\ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  Within the\ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documented payments and\ncontacts with a number of her listed creditors.  Her post-hearing exhibits were admitted\nand considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant accumulated 28 debts exceeding $31,000.00.\nApplicant admitted most of the listed debts but denied the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.d and 1.I on the grounds she does not recognize the debts as her\ndebts.  She denied subparagraph 1.q on the grounds the debt was paid when she sold\nher house.   And she denied subparagraphs 1.s and 1.bb on the stated grounds they\nwere duplicates of debts covered by subparagraphs 1.k and 1.n. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old senior engineering associate for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant accumulated 28 debts over a five-year period that exceed $31,000.00.\nMany of her debts are medically related.  Some are linked to the period in 2004 when\nher husband lost his job.\nApplicant married H in 1990.  She has two sons from that marriage (ex. 1; R.T.,\nat 74-75).  For the first three years of their marriage Applicant and her husband\nmaintained good control of their finances, despite living a little  beyond their means\n(R.T., at 71).  When H lost his job in 2004, they began experiencing considerable\nfinancial difficulties.  During this period, Appellant accrued considerable consumer debts\nand medical debts associated with H\u2019s hospitalization (R.T., at 62-63). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems compounded after her separation from H and his\nrelocating elsewhere.  She described her marriage to H as a violent one: H had an\nalcohol problem, and had difficulty holding a job (R.T., at 71-72).   After H lost his job in\n2004, they were forced to sell their home on a short sale basis, and move into a trailer\n(R.T., at 38).  With their marriage severely strained, H moved out of their trailer in July\n\n3\n2005, and moved to another state (R.T., at 38).   Applicant subsequently filed for\ndivorce, which was finalized in May 2006 (see ex. 1).  As a part of their divorce decree,\nH was required to provide monthly child support of $300.00 a month. H makes only\nsporadic child support payments, and has avoided scheduled child support hearings\n(R.T., at 35, 72-73).  \nApplicant\u2019s three largest debts comprise deficiencies on two cars she obligated\nherself on with her ex-spouse, and the cost of windows installed in her house that was\nsubsequently sold.  In 2000, she purchased an Altima for about $10,000.00.  When she\nand H began having financial problems in 2004, the car was repossessed by creditor\n1.r.  Applicant assures she never received notice of the public sale of the vehicle (R.T.,\nat 40-43).  Because the listed deficiency so closely reflects the purchase price of the\ncar, Applicant does not believe the listed debts reflect any credited proceeds from the\nsale of the car (see ex. 5; R.T., at 40-43).   As a result, she contests the validity of the\ndeficiency debt associated with creditor 1.\nThe second of Applicant\u2019s major debts reflects a reported deficiency on another\nvehicle purchased by Applicant.  In 2004, she and her husband purchased a Buick for\nabout $13,000.00.  She assures she made payments on the vehicle for about six to\neight months before her husband moved to another state and took the car with him\n(R.T., at 41-42).  H defaulted on his payments for the car, and the creditor (creditor 1.p)\ncame to Applicant\u2019s house looking for the vehicle (R.T., at 43).  Applicant informed\ncreditor 1.p of H\u2019s whereabouts (R.T., at 43), and subsequently learned that the creditor\nrepossessed the vehicle.  After the sale, a deficiency was assessed in the amount of\n$8,651.00 (see ex. 5; R.T., at 66-67).  This amount is apparently still owed on the\nvehicle to creditor 1.p, which Applicant does not dispute  (R.T., at 68-70).  \nApplicant\u2019s third major debt (creditor 1.q) for some windows that were installed in\nher home in 2002 (see exs. 5 and K).  After H lost his job in 2004, they were forced to\nsell the home by means of a \u201cshort sale\u201d to avert foreclosure (R.T., at 45-46).  Applicant\ndisputes this creditor 1.q debt based on her expressed belief that the obligation was\nabsorbed by the loan assumed by the buyer of the house.   Her efforts to verify\nsatisfaction of this debt have not been fruitful (see ex. L; R.T., at 45-46).\nIn the past, Applicant disputed a number of the debts listed in the SOR.  In her\npost-hearing submissions, she documented her disputed debts with creditor 1.m (ex. N),\ncreditors 1.b and creditors 1.f through 1.h (see exs. 5, K and L through T), creditor 1.l\n(ex. K), creditor 1.o (ex. L), and creditor 1.q  (R.T., at 54-61, 64-65).  Most of these\ndebts have since been removed from her most recent credit report (see ex. K).\nApplicant is also able to document her payments to several of her listed creditors:\ncreditor 1.a (ex. O), creditor 1.k (see exs. 2 and M), creditor 1.m (see ex. N),  and\ncreditors 1.w through 1.aa (see exs. A through G, P, Q, R, S and T; R.T., at 47-56,62-\n70).  She assures, too, that she has paid creditors 1.c, 1.l and 1.t, which are no longer\nreflected in her credit report (see ex. K; R.T., at 52-62).  Albeit, she has not been able to\nprovide any additional payment documentation.\n\n4\nApplicant also disputes two of the listed debts (creditors 1.s and 1.bb) on the\ngrounds that they are duplicates of the listed debts covered by subparagraphs 1.k and\n1.s, respectively.  The respective debts cover roughly the same amounts and identify\neither the same creditor (in the case of creditors 1.s and 1.k) or the same type of\ncollection account (creditors 1.n and 1.bb).  Applicant\u2019s claims are corroborated by her\ncredit reports (see exs. 4 and 5), reflect plausible and credible explanations, and are\naccepted.   \nWhile she has sought formal counseling regarding her finances, Applicant has\nrelied on the advice of a well known radio commentator in her community who\nrecommends to listeners with debt problems to pay their smaller debts first, before\naddressing their larger debts (R.T., at 76-77).  Appellant has been following this advice\nto the best of her ability.  She estimates to have a minus $73.00 remainder each month\nin her most recent financial statement (see ex. 2; R.T., at 81).  She lives in her father\u2019s\nhouse with her two sons and has had to expend considerable money on utilities and\nrepairs in this very old house (R.T., at 78-79).  She pays her sister over $300.00 a\nmonth on the car she is purchasing from her (R.T., at 73-74, 80-81).  To pay some of\nher listed old debts with the limited income she has, she has had to borrow from her\nsister and work odd jobs at her church for extra money (R.T., at 81-82).\nApplicant is highly regarded by her supervisors, co-workers and friends.  The\ndirector of her office for the past 18 months of her employment describes her as a very\ntrustworthy, dependable, and responsible administrative assistant who performs her\nassigned duties flawlessly (see ex. J).  Management personnel in her department who\nwork with her on a daily basis characterize her as highly ethical, dependable, and\ntrustworthy (ex. J).  Her pastor describes her as a \u201cmodel of sincere and true faith\u201d with\nunquestionable integrity and trustworthiness (ex. J).  And her good friend and junior\nhigh math teacher in her community credits her with extraordinary help with her\nstudents as a full-time teacher\u2019s aide (ex. J).  She is known to have impressed other\nteachers and staff with the responsible way she accepted and handled her various tasks\nand responsibilities (see ex. J).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n5\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a senior engineering associate for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts over a five-year period spanning 2004: and\n\n6\n2007, some disputed and some acknowledged..  Considered together, and without\nresolution, they raise  security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and her past inability to address most of these debts\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC\n19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to income shortages following her\ndivorce. With little child support from her former husband, and no health insurance for a\nconsiderable time before she obtained her current position, she has had to struggle\nfinancially as a single parent with little income to cover her medical needs and family\nnecessities.  Several of her debts (including her three largest debts) were jointly\ncreated with her ex-husband who departed without bearing any responsibility for the\nremaining marital obligations. These debts include the deficiency balances on two\nvehicle repossessions, as well as the debt associated with window installations on the\nhouse she and her former husband jointly sold before their divorce.   Applicant believes\nthis latter debt was incorporated in the mortgage loan assumed by the buyers of the of\nthe house.  Although, she has not been able to provide any documentation of any\nbuyer\u2019s assumption of this debt.  Applicant continues to dispute a number of the other\nlisted debts, some or all of which may belong to her ex-husband.  \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has initiated considerable efforts to resolve\nthe debts she acknowledges as her own, and dispute those she insists are not.\nSpecifically, she is able to document payments to some of her listed creditors (creditors\n1.a, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.w through 1.aa and provide corroborated explanations of several\nduplicated debts (i.e., creditors 1.n and 1.bb and creditors 1.k and 1.s).\nTo be sure, Applicant has not been able to document payment or dispute of all\nof the listed debts.  Just the same, she assures she has paid several of the creditors\nthat she is not able to document (i.e., creditors 1.c, 1.l, and 1.t), which are no longer\nreflected on her most recent credit report.  She has not been able to document any\nresolution of her three largest debts (creditors p, q and r); they remain outstanding.\nWith the help of her sister, her work income, and the small amounts of money she\nreceives from doing odd jobs at her church, she hopes to address her remaining debts.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with her\nsudden loss of marital income in 2004, her ensuing divorce with little child support from\nher former husband, the limited resources that have been available to her to address\nher old debts, and her documented  responsible efforts to resolve her acknowledged\n\n7\ndebts, Applicant may rely on MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation,\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations.  Extenuating circumstances continue to impact Applicant in\nher current efforts to resolve her accumulated debts.  \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her credible proofs of\npayment, age of the debts, and good-faith disputes.  Applicant is able to demonstrate\ncredible disputes with a number of her creditors and initiated repayment efforts with\nmost of her smaller creditors.  Age of the debts at issue is covered by two of the\nmitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d has applicability, while not dispositive.  MC (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some\napplicability.  MC 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d has applicability as well relative to the listed creditors she disputes. \nApplicant seriously disputes her three major debts with creditors 1.p, 1.q, and\n1.r.  Whether any of these debts are valid any more is not clear.  Two of the debts\n(creditors 1.q and 1.r) originated in 2002 (creditor 1.q) and 2000 (creditor 1.r),\nrespectively, and show no activity in the accounts since 2003.  For these accounts,\nregardless of whether they reflect otherwise valid debts owing, they may no longer be\nenforceable under the State\u2019s applicable statute of limitations for written contracts.  \nThe state statute of limitations in Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written\ncontract is four years (see 16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code) and\nclaims not otherwise provided for (see 16.051 of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code). \nOnly Applicant\u2019s Buick purchase in November 2004 does not appear to be barred by\nthe State\u2019s four-year statute of limitation.  This is the vehicle H took with him when he\nseparated from Applicant and  assumed implicit responsibility for making the required\npayments.  While Applicant may have continuing joint and several liability for this debt,\nthere would appear to be little risk of collection on the debt or justification for attributing\njudgment lapses to Applicant under all the circumstances considered.     \nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by\nour Appeal Board to absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.\nStatutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.  They have never\nbeen equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020,\nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  Weight, if any, to be assigned to potentially statutes of\nlimitations under the new Guidelines should be considered in light of all the\n\n8\ncircumstances surrounding the existing debts, and must take account of the Applicant\u2019s\nentire history of demonstrated trust and responsibility.  Viewed in this whole person\nlight, the controlling state statute of limitation for written contracts is  entitled to be\naccorded significant mitigation weight in evaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk. \n                                                        \nWhile the counseling advice Applicant relied on does not technically fit the\ndefinition of counseling services under the Guidelines, she is to be credited with\nearnestly looking for sources of financial advice with the resources available to her and\ntaking productive advantage of the public advice she received in addressing her debts. \nShe may take limited advantage MC 20\u00a9), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Based on her initiated efforts to date, prospects for her\ngaining important insights in handling her finances in the future appear to be promising.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, her documented steps taken to resolve them, and the\nresponsibility and trustworthiness she is credited with in her work, church, and personal\nlife as a struggling single parent, Applicant mitigates security concerns related to both\nher disputed debts and her proven debt delinquencies.

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O'Connell, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant had two debts, one she has paid and the other covered by insurance. The record\nevidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from a\ndebt of such magnitude. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\n1\n\n2\nApplicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued\ndue to financial considerations security concerns.\nOn August 17, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter decided\nwithout a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM), dated September 26, 2007.  Applicant was sent a copy of the FORM, along with\nnotice of her opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\npotentially disqualifying conditions. \nOn October 19, 2007, Applicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel did not object\nto the material. Applicant\u2019s response was admitted into the record. On November 2, 2007, I was\nassigned the case. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns based on financial considerations. After a thorough\nreview of the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old aircraft mechanic who has worked for a defense contractor since\nJanuary 2004, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. \nDuring the past eight years, Applicant\u2019s husband had health issues. In 1998, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband was unable to work for several months due to his illness. During his illness, Applicant\nworked two or three jobs attempting to make ends meet. (Item 4) The SOR lists two charged off\naccounts. The first debt is a $11,832 credit card obligation (SOR 1.a). Applicant contacted the\ncreditor and settled this debt, paying $1,200 as evidenced by an August 2007 letter. (Item 4) The\nbalance was interest and finance charges incurred during the last eight to ten years on the original\ndebt. Applicant had been unsuccessful in her previously attempting to work with the collection\nagencies to pay this debt. The debt is paid and has a zero balance. (Item 4)\nApplicant\u2019s February 2006 credit bureau report (CBR)(Item 9) lists two accounts with this\ncreditor with different account numbers. However, the creditor does not appear on Applicant\u2019s more\nrecent CBRs of June 25, 2007 (Item 4), the June 28, 2007 (Item 7), or the March 2007 (Item 8). \nIn March 2001, Applicant purchased a car for $13,717. In August 2003, Applicant was\ninvolved in an accident in which the vehicle was totally destroyed. At the time of the accident,\n$7,000 was owed on the vehicle. Although Applicant had full insurance on the vehicle, the insurance\ncompany offered payment of only $3,000, which reflected the salvage value of the car. A week prior\nthe accident, in anticipation of trading the vehicle, Applicant had it appraised and it was valued at\n$8,200. The book value on the car was $7,000. (Item 4) The SOR alleges $4,000 is owed.\nThe insurance company appraiser told Applicant she did not have to accept the $3,000 offer,\nso she did not accept it.  Time passed and she assumed the insurance company had paid the creditor\nthe full value due and owing on the vehicle.  However, the unpaid balance was reported as a loss by\nthe credit grantor. (Item 9) Years later, Applicant discovered, from a credit report, the creditor\ncharged off $4,306. The SOR alleges the debt was charged off in July 2003. \n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n3\nFederal law mandates an original creditor must charge-off an account when no payments\nhave been received for a certain period of time. The state statute of limitation for debt collection in\nApplicant\u2019s state is four years. The statute of limitation applies only to litigation action and does not\nmean the debt is no longer owed or has been erased. The passage of the Statute of Limitation bars\na creditor from using litigation to collect a debt. The debt remains on the credit report for up to\nseven years and in some case the public record can remain for 10 years. \nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof. All that is required is proof of facts and\ncircumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that\nan applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\nrequired of persons handling classified information. Additionally, the government must prove\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts\nto an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\n\n4\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her\nfinances so as to meet her financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owes approximately $16,000 on two debts.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d apply. \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated she had paid the debt listed in SOR 1.a.  Having\nstated a debt has been paid is equivalent to denying an allegation. The burden is then on the\nGovernment prove the allegation. Government indicates there are two accounts with this creditor\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s February 2006 CBR that lists the two accounts. However, the record\ncontains three more recent CBRs, none of which shows a debt due the creditor. The debt does not\nappear on her March 2007 CBR nor on either of her two June 2007 CBRs. Providing a single, older\nCBR does not prove the debt is yet owed. \nMitigating Condition MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies.  Applicant submitted an August 2007 letter indicating\nthe debt owed the creditor in SOR 1.a. had been paid. It is my experience that credit collection\nagencies are reluctant to provide any favorable written information about payment of a debt. In this\ncase, the collection provided a letter indicated Applicant paid her account.  It would be unusual for\na collection agency to provide such a letter if Applicant owed additional monies to the same creditor.\nA collection agency withholds all favorable information until the entire debt with a given creditor\nhas been paid or settled.  Based on the more recent CBRs and the practice of collection agencies,\nI find Applicant has paid the creditor listed in SOR 1.a.\nI find MC 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\napplies to the car debt. Approximately $4,000, the unpaid balance on a car loan, was reported as a\nloss by the credit grantor. She had insurance on her car. A week before the accident the car was\n\n\u201cThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\n3\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue.\u201d\n5\nappraised at $8,000. After the accident, the insurance company told her it is only worth $3,000.  She\ndisputes owing anything.  She learned her insurance company failed to pay off the car years after\nthe event. \nApplicant\u2019s husband suffered from illness and Applicant worked two or three jobs to make\nends meet.  This was a condition beyond her control.  Taking extra jobs shows she acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance. \nA person buys insurance to protect themselves and others from economic loss and medical\ncosts should an accident occur.  Following an accident, some insurance companies will offer less\nthan the true fair market value of an insured vehicle. Applicant maintained insurance to pay for the\nvehicle if it was in an accident.  She has a legitimate dispute about this debt. The Government argues\nMitigating Condition (MC) 20 (e)  does not apply because Applicant failed to document the basis\n3\nof the dispute. I find her explanation to be a reasonable and plausible explanation even without\nwritten documents. \nAdditionally, the debt exceeds the state statute of limitations.  This does not mean Applicant\nno longer owes the debt, only that the creditor can no longer bring litigation to enforce the debt.\nFailing to pay this debt does not show an inability by Applicant to live within her means.  It may\nshow an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations in that people should pay their just debts.\nHowever, when one has insurance to pay the obligation in the event of an accident and the insurance\ncompany refuses to make full pay, this does not show an unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations. The amount of the debt coupled with the passage of the statute of limitation indicates\nApplicant is not financially overextended or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  It would be unusual for someone to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to\npay a debt that is no longer enforceable. Additionally, Applicant is not financially over extended by\na $4,000 debt.\nWhile the record contains information addressed in one adjudicative guideline, consideration\nsuch also be given to information bearing on the whole person.  The adjudicative process must\ninclude examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination\nthat the person is an acceptable security risk.  Therefore, I have also considered: the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the\ncircumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \nOn balance, the record before me support a conclusion Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n               \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations) that Applicant owes delinquent debt of about $12,145 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i), and that he was not paying on his debts as of a December 7, 2006, interview (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and financial interrogatories (SOR \u00b6 1.l). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2006 e-QIP by denying he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years, and that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant denied he owed an alleged civil judgment of $950 to a former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.a) but admitted the remaining allegations. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old painter who has been employed by a defense contractor since September 2005 (Tr. 33-34). He seeks a security clearance for his duties (Ex. 1), never having held a clearance (Tr. 40). After graduating from high school, Applicant went to work as a painter (Ex. 1). He and his brother rented a house from June 1998 to July 2000. When the property was sold, Applicant and his brother were given 30 days to vacate the premises. They moved out two weeks before the deadline and did not pay the rent for their last month. They also did not inform the landlord (a realty company) that they had vacated the premises (Tr. 41-45).

On September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn October 19, 2007, Applicant filed his initial response to the SOR, but it was\nincomplete. Applicant submitted an answer dated November 15, 2007, in which he\nresponded to all the SOR allegations, and he requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on December 27, 2007. On February 21, 2008, I scheduled a hearing\nfor March 25, 2008.\nApril 25, 2008\n\nApplicant indicated no gap in his painting jobs in 2000 when he completed his e-QIP (Ex. 1). W hen asked\n1\nwhy he did not report his unemployment in 2000, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, just so there wasn\u2019t any\ngaps, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d  (Tr. 48).\n2\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) were\nadmitted without any objections, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on April 4, 2008. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations) that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt of about $12,145 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i), and that he was not paying on his\ndebts as of a December 7, 2006, interview (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and financial interrogatories\n(SOR \u00b6 1.l). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have\ndeliberately falsified his October 2006 e-QIP by denying he had been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts in the last seven years, and that he was currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant denied he owed an alleged civil judgment of $950 to a former landlord\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) but admitted the remaining allegations. After consideration of the evidence\nof record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old painter who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since September 2005 (Tr. 33-34). He seeks a security clearance for his\nduties (Ex. 1), never having held a clearance (Tr. 40).\nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant went to work as a painter (Ex. 1). He\nand his brother rented a house from June 1998 to July 2000.  When the property was\nsold, Applicant and his brother were given 30 days to vacate the premises. They moved\nout two weeks before the deadline and did not pay the rent for their last month. They\nalso did not inform the landlord (a realty company) that they had vacated the premises\n(Tr. 41-45). In August 2000, the realty company obtained a judgment against Applicant\nand his brother in the amount of $950 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Ex. 5). Applicant was unaware of\nthe judgment until he went to buy a home. He claims he and his brother settled with the\nlandlord by each paying $450, although he no longer has the check to prove it (Ex. 3,\nTr. 42, 46).\nIn 2000, Applicant and his brother bought a home together for $58,000. They put\ndown $13,000 with a mortgage for the rest. Applicant contributed $3,500 toward the\ndownpayment, $2,500 of it inherited from his grandmother and $1,000 borrowed from\nhis girlfriend\u2019s father. Applicant was included on the deed and he split the $500 plus\nmonthly mortgage payments with his brother (Tr. 66-67).\nApplicant was unemployed for three or four months in 2000 (Tr. 30-31, 47).  He\n1\ncollected about $144 per week before taxes in unemployment compensation (Tr. 30-\n\nApplicant testified he made four payments before they closed his account, \u201cnot because of nonpayment but\n2\nsomething about just reserving the right to close any and all accounts.\u201d (Tr. 54). He acknowledged he still\nowed the debt (Tr. 55).\n3\n31). He then went to work as a painter in the auto body industry under his brother\u2019s\nsupervision (Ex. 1). Due to poor financial management skills (\u201cMy finances, I\u2019m pretty, I\nwouldn\u2019t say irresponsible with but I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not that good at taking care of them.\u201d Tr.\n28), Applicant fell behind on several consumer credit accounts while he was gainfully\nemployed. Following another period of unemployment from September 2003 to January\n2004, Applicant worked for a year as a painter for an auto collision company. He was\nthereafter unemployed for nine months (Ex. 1), and his unemployment compensation\nwas not sufficient to cover his monthly expenses and his consumer credit obligations\n(Tr. 27).\nIn March 2000, Applicant bought a television (Tr. 49). An unpaid credit balance of\n$1,328 was charged off in August 2002 and placed for collection the following month\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) (Ex. 5). In about January 2001, Applicant cancelled his cellular phone\ncontract early because he could no longer afford the cost (Tr. 49). He was assessed an\nearly termination fee that he did not pay (Tr. 48). In February 2003, the creditor placed a\n$234 delinquent balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Ex. 5). A satellite television debt of\n$188 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), owed since January 2001, was eventually placed for collection in\nJune 2005 (Ex. 5. Tr. 53). In August 2001, Applicant purchased a computer on credit\n(Tr. 46). In September 2002, a $3,048 debt was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Ex.\n5). A credit account opened in or before January 2002 was placed for collection in April\n2003 with $3,127 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.e) (Ex. 5). In November 2002, a catalog\nmerchandiser placed a $185 past due balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h) (Ex. 5, Tr. 52,\n54).\nMedical debts of $165 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) incurred in November 2004 and $620 (not\n2\nalleged) in February 2005 were referred for collection and his old debts went unpaid\n(Ex. 5).\nIn September 2005, Applicant began working as a painter for his current\nemployer. Since he had to get caught up on accounts that had fallen behind when he\nwas unemployed, he did not pay on his old debts, including a VISA card account that\nhad been delinquent since February 2002. In May 2006, the creditor referred a $1,744\nbalance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.i) (Ex. 5). After his wireless telephone service contract\nended in about December 2004, Applicant did not pay the remaining balance of $155\nand the creditor placed his account for collection in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Ex. 4, Tr. 57).\nIn July 2006, Applicant took in his mother to live with him after she injured herself\nand was out of work on disability. She stayed with Applicant until late September 2007\n(Tr. 68). She did not contribute financially to the household with the exception of buying\nher own food once in awhile (Tr. 69).\n\n4\nDuring the summer of 2006, Applicant was given an e-QIP by his employer and\ntold to fill it out (Tr. 27). Aware he had delinquent debt but not sure to what extent,\nApplicant left the financial delinquency section blank. When he provided the form to his\nsecurity office for electronic processing, he indicated verbally that he had debt but was\nhoping to pay it off through a refinancing of his mortgage (Tr. 26-27). He was told by a\nsecurity office employee to answer \u201cno\u201d to the financial inquiries (Tr. 30). Knowing that\nhe probably should have answered in the affirmative but sure that the government\nwould obtain his credit information, he responded \u201cNo\u201d to 28a (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have\nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d) and 28b (\u201cAre you currently over\n90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d) (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 26-27, 30). After they refinanced,\nApplicant spent about $10,000 installing new windows, heating system, cabinets, and\nappliances (\u201cMy theory on that was if I made myself a very comfortable place to live, I\nwouldn\u2019t have to spend any more money on anything else and I could pay my bills. . . .\u201d\nTr. 83). He now realizes that he should have paid off his debt instead (Tr. 71-72, 83).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit in October 2006 revealed the judgment debt of $950\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and nine debts in collection totaling $11,815 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j plus $620 for\na medical debt not alleged) (Ex. 5). In December 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator about his financial indebtedness and his failure to list any\ndelinquencies on his e-QIP. Concerning his income and expenses, Applicant estimated\nhe had $434 per month in discretionary funds after paying his mortgage and other\nrecurring monthly expenses. He acknowledged he was not currently making payments\non his delinquent debt, and was surprised to learn that it had accumulated to almost\n$12,000. He attributed his financial problems to unemployment and surmised that some\nof the debt was incurred by a former girlfriend with whom he had lived for about six\nyears. Applicant recalled that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for a computer, and that he\nhad recently paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant also maintained he had settled the\ncourt judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He indicated he would either contact his other creditors\nhimself or seek assistance from a credit counseling service. Applicant admitted that he\nshould have disclosed his indebtedness on his e-QIP, but explained that he did not\nhave a good feel for his overall financial posture. He denied any intent to conceal in that\nhe knew he would eventually be called to explain (Ex. 3).\nIn February 2007, Applicant agreed to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,944.85\nbalance as reported by a new collection agency) at $277.83 per month (Ex. 2, Tr. 50).\nApplicant made two payments totaling about $300 on the debt by December 2007 (Tr.\n50-51). In response to DOHA interrogatories requesting a financial update, Applicant\nestimated he had a monthly net remainder of $313.69 after expenses and the television\ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He indicated that after the television debt, he would pay off the small\ndebts and then take out a personal loan to pay off the rest. He explained that it was the\nbest he could do for now as he was just getting back on his feet (Ex. 2).\nIn September 2007, Applicant told DOHA that he was planning on giving up his\nshare of the house and moving into his father\u2019s home so that he can pay his debt (Ex.\n3). About a month later, he found his mother an apartment, removed himself from the\n\n5\ndeed to the home, and moved into his father\u2019s basement. He has since been paying\nrent at $100 per week (Tr. 69-70).\nApplicant was out of work on temporary disability for about six weeks in\nSeptember/October 2007. In December 2007, Applicant was again placed on temporary\ndisability due to illness (Tr. 33). As of his hearing, he was still out of work and scheduled\nto undergo surgery within the next month (Tr. 89-90). His temporary disability pay is\n$432 per week, which is about $200 less than had he been able to work (Tr. 36-37).\n \nDuring the first quarter of 2008, two of Applicant\u2019s creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.i)\nobtained judgments against him (Tr. 27, 57-59). Applicant contacted the assignee owed\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b because the creditor had been awarded a judgment of about\n$8,000 when the original debt was about $3,000.  Applicant has not yet arranged to\nsettle the debt (\u201cI haven\u2019t sent the letter yet though because I really don\u2019t know where I\nstand financially, at the moment.\u201d Tr.58). The other judgment is for about $3,000 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.i) (Tr. 59).\nIn December 2007 or January 2008, Applicant contacted a couple of lawyers\nabout filing for bankruptcy, which he considers to be his only option (\u201cthe Chapter 13, to\nme, feels like it would be a reasonable thing for me to do, seeing as though I personally\ncan\u2019t handle it.\u201d). (Tr. 28, 33, 85, 90). He has saved about $800, which is enough to\ncover the filing based on a quote he received from one lawyer (Tr. 89), but he also\nincurred veterinary bills and car repair costs (70, 82) that delayed filing. He wants to get\nhis medical situation resolved before he files for bankruptcy (Tr. 89).\nApplicant\u2019s current hourly wage is $16.73 plus $1.40 shift differential following a\nraise in March 2008. Raises are automatic every six months until he reaches an hourly\nrate of $21 (Tr. 31). Based on his income and estimated expenses, he had about $800\nin disposable income per month as of March 2008.\nApplicant drives a 1992 model year vehicle he bought from his father for $500.\nHe put $2,000 into the car (Tr. 70, 82). He owes $236 for cable television and $1,800 for\nelectric service at his previous residence (Tr. 76-77). He has not made any payments\non those debts, although he recently arranged to make $100 monthly payments on the\nelectric bill (Tr. 80-81). He is saving his money to cover costs associated with his\nupcoming surgery (Tr. 81). He is now trying to live frugally, aware that his spending on\ndiscretionary items such as electronic and kitchen gadgets had gotten \u201cout of control\u201d\n(Tr. 84-85). Applicant does not intend to purchase items in the future unless he can pay\ncash for them. He enjoys his job and does not want to jeopardize it by getting further\ninto debt (Tr. 84-87). Applicant considers himself \u201cterrible at the finances\u201d and in need of\nfurther education concerning handling his money (Tr. 87).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n6\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\n\n7\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems since about 2000, when he and his\nbrother moved out of a house without paying the last month\u2019s rent. The landlord\nobtained a financial judgment against him. While the judgment remains on his credit\nreport, Applicant\u2019s claim of settlement is credible. His credit report corroborates his\nclaim of satisfaction with respect to another debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). However, two creditors\nobtained judgments against him in 2008 in amounts significantly higher than their\noriginal balances, so Applicant now owes almost $20,000 in delinquent debt. Significant\nsecurity concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a))\nand by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nThe government argues for consideration also of AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of\nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt\u201d). There\nis evidence of irresponsible spending, apparently for electronic and kitchen gadgets.\nAround 2001/02, Applicant ran up consumer credit balances (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b for the\ncomputer, 1.d for the television, 1.e and 1.i on credit card accounts) without regard to\nhis ability to repay them. AG \u00b6 19(b) does not apply given his plan to resolve his debts\nthrough a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Applicant contacted a couple of lawyers and saved\nthe money to file. His failure to follow through to date must be considered in evaluating\nwhether he presents an unacceptable risk because of his handling of his finances,\nhowever.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay on his debts from January 2005 to September 2005 is\nexcused due to his unemployment. He collected $144 weekly, which was not enough to\ncover his living expenses as well as the debts. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d)\napplies only in part. Affording him some time to get caught up after going to work for the\ndefense contractor, he reported discretionary income of $434 as of December 2006,\nand was doing little to address his old delinquencies. Apart from food costs, it is not\nclear that caring for his mother increased his financial burden, as he had to pay his\nshare of the mortgage and utility costs regardless. Since his interview in December\n2006, Applicant has known that the government is concerned about his finances. He\nhas satisfied only the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h and paid only about $300 total on the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d when he was supposed to pay $277.83 per month starting in February 2007.\nHe has not done enough to qualify for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).\n\n8\nA Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing would go a long way toward mitigating the\nconcerns raised by his significant debt burden but it would be premature to conclude\nthat his financial problems are likely to be resolved in the near future. He has not yet\nformally retained legal counsel to file under Chapter 13. Nor has he obtained the\nfinancial counseling or education that would address the root cause of his financial\ndifficulties. He lacks sufficient knowledge of his financial situation to deal with his debts\non his own (\u201cI really don\u2019t know where I stand financially at the moment.\u201d Tr. 58).\nReducing his living expenses by renting a basement room from his father is a good first\nstart, but Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. When he moved out of his\nprevious residence in late September 2007, he owed $236 for cable television and\n$1,800 for electric services. His failure to make any payments on his utility and cable\ntelevision debts reflects current financial irresponsibility.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his October 2006 e-QIP\nby failing to disclose thereon any delinquent debts. Knowing he had bad debts but\nlacking a good handle on their extent (I just didn\u2019t know what was owed, how many days\nit was late. . . . Tr. 26), Applicant initially did not respond to question 28a (any debts\nover 180 days delinquent in the last 7 years) or question 28b (currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debts). He testified further, with no rebuttal by the government and\nlittle inquiry on the issue, that he informed the security office employee to whom he\nhanded the form for electronic processing, that he had debts but planned to pay them\npossibly by refinancing his mortgage. He was told by the security officer to answer \u201cno\u201d\nto the questions (Tr. 30). Despite his recognition that he should have answered the\nquestions affirmatively (\u201cAnd if I did answer them yes, which I probably knew I should\nhave. . . .\u201d Tr. 26), Applicant responded negatively to both questions. Under AG \u00b6 16(a)\npersonal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant knew he had delinquent\ndebts, and ignorance of the specific information does not make his negative responses\nany less false.\nApplicant has consistently denied any intent to conceal his financial problems,\nand submits that he knew the government would find out about them. He has an\n\n9\nobligation of candor that is not alleviated by a government inquiry. However, as\nconceded by the government (Tr. 98), the evidence supports application of AG \u00b6 17(b)\n(\u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or\nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or\nlegal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security\nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide\nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully\u201d). When questioned by a\ngovernment investigator in December 2006, Applicant apparently expressed surprise at\nthe extent of his debt, which is telling of his poor understanding of his personal financial\nsituation. The impact of the advice of the security office employee cannot be discounted\nunder the circumstances.\nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of\nthe \u201cwhole person concept\u201d required under \u00b6 2(a) of the Directive. Given the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debt and his track record of questionable financial decisions, I\nam unable to conclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant him access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant has paid all her\ndelinquent debts but one which she is currently paying. She is now financially stable. Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns based on her financial issues. Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 20-21; GE 1.\n2\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On May 29, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on June 27, 2007, and elected to have her case decided on the written record. On July 12,\n2007, Applicant changed her request to a hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 3, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August\n14, 2007, scheduling the hearing for September 6, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. The Government offered four exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, and admitted without objections. Applicant testified and offered 11\nexhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K, and admitted without objections.\nThe record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material. She did\nso in a timely manner. The documents consisting of a fax cover sheet dated September 7, 2007 (AE\nL), three pages of checks (AE M), a fax cover sheet dated September 13, 2007 (AE N), letter from\nMerchants\u2019 Credit Guide Co. (AE O), check to Merchants\u2019 Credit Guide Co. (AE P), letter from\nEquifax (AE Q), and letter from Applicant (AE R), were admitted without objections. Department\nCounsel\u2019s memo forwarding the exhibits is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 17, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is a college graduate.\nApplicant is single, with no children. She has worked for her current employer for five years.2\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in the 1990s from a combination of insufficient\nincome and reliance on credit cards. She also assisted her mother financially when she was\nhospitalized with meningitis. The SOR lists four delinquent debts, three debts totaling $1,317, and\n\nTr. at 40-44, GE 2-4; AE C, H, R.\n3\nTr. at 22-23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D, E, H at 6.\n4\nTr. at 23-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3 at 2; AE A, H at 6.\n5\nTr. at 25-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, H.\n6\nTr. at 28-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F-I, N-R.\n7\nTr. at 44-53.\n8\n3\na large debt for $16,104. Applicant had other delinquent debts, but she paid or settled those debts\nprior to the issuance of the SOR.3\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in the amount of $298 is to a retail store. Applicant paid this debt on\nMarch 28, 2007.4\nSOR \u00b6 1.b lists a debt in the amount of $347 for a gasoline company credit card issued by\na bank. Applicant submitted proof that the balance on an account she had with a credit card from\nanother gasoline company issued by the same bank was zero. Applicant testified this referred to the\nsame account as listed in the SOR. The government\u2019s evidence is based upon credit reports which\nare sometimes inaccurate.  I found Applicant to be a credible witness. I find that this debt either has\n5\nbeen paid, or Applicant honestly believes it has been paid.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in the amount of $672 is to a department store. Applicant submitted\ndocumentation that this debt was paid in September 2003. A credit report of August 19, 2007 does\nnot list this debt.  \n6\nSOR \u00b6 1.d lists a debt of $16,104 for a credit card. Applicant testified this debt was sold to\na collection agency. Applicant submitted documentation of a debt to a collection agency, with a\nbalance of $8,318 as of June 29, 2007. She stated the $16,104 figure reflects the original debt and\naccrued interest, but that the collection agency only received the original debt without the accrued\ninterest. Applicant has a payment plan with the collection agency to pay $250 per month. She\nprovided proof of $250 payments in June, July, August, and September 2007. The balance before\nher September 2007 payment was $7,818. I note that a debt to this collection agency is not listed on\nany of the credit reports in evidence. Additionally, the balances on the various statements from the\ncollection agency go down by exactly $250 per month, which is consistent with Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony that the agency is not charging her interest.  I accept Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that\n7\nher payments to this collection agency represent the same debt as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d.\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling, but it appears she now has a firm grasp\nof her finances. She has a secure job, paying a good salary. Applicant had a clear understanding of\nhow her money was being spent and where it was going. She displayed resolve to continue on track\nand pay her last delinquent debt, even if she was denied a security clearance and lost her job.8\n\nAE J, K.\n9\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n10\nId. at 527.\n11\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n12\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n13\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n14\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n4\nApplicant submitted a positive performance appraisal and several letters attesting to her\nintelligence, dependability, responsibility, trustworthiness, honesty, commitment, loyalty,\ncompetence, and professionalism.9\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n10\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n11\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n12\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n13\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n14\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n15\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts establish Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC\nDC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations).\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant still owes more than $7,500 to a creditor, so I am unable to apply FC MC 20(a).\nApplicant stated that she helped her mother financially when she was ill. She did not provide\nsufficient details for a finding that this was a major factor in her financial problems, or that she acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. FC MC 20(b) does not apply.\nApplicant has not received counseling for her financial problems. However she has been\nworking on paying her debts for some time. She paid the three small debts in the SOR, and is making\npayments on the large debt. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c was paid in September 2003. She also paid or\nsettled other debts prior to the issuance of the SOR. Applicant credibly testified that she would\ncontinue to pay her last delinquent debt, no matter the outcome of her hearing. With diligence, the\npayment of her last delinquent debt is attainable. I find Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved and is under control. FC MC 20(c) and FC MC 20(d) apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\n\n6\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant developed financial problems when she was younger. She has worked at the same\ncompany since 2002, and is well regarded there. She has been addressing her financial problems for\nseveral years. Applicant now has her financial house in order, with a clear and realistic plan to\naddress her remaining delinquent debt.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn Bayard Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. It is too soon to tell if she will\nresolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance is denied. \n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May\n2, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for\nthe action and alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations based on\ndelinquent debts. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn May 30, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR. She indicated she did not wish to have a\nhearing because she could not afford the trip. Thereafter, department counsel requested a hearing and\nnotified Applicant by letter. This matter was addressed at the start of the hearing (R. 15\u201318).\nApplicant  did not understand that the hearing would be conducted at a location near her as opposed\nto Washington, D.C., and she had no objections to a hearing. The hearing took place as scheduled\non August 9, 2007, and the transcript was received on August 23, 2007.\nThe record was kept open until August 23, 2007, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit\nadditional documentary information about her financial situation. To date, she has not submitted\npost-hearing documentation.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts for about $19,711 in total. Applicant\ndenied all the allegations except for SOR subparagraph 1.h. Notwithstanding her denials, she also\nprovided a short explanation for each debt. In addition, the following facts are established. \n\n3\nApplicant is a 52-year-old planning analyst. She has worked for her current employer since\n1986. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. A 2006 performance and\ndevelopment summary rated her overall performance as about average (Exhibit E).\nApplicant married in 1983. She and her husband lived separately during 2002\u20132003. They\nhave two children, now ages 18 and 21. Both live with Applicant and neither child makes a financial\ncontribution to the household. The daughter has a child and is currently pregnant. \nShe and her husband earned a gross income in 2006 of about $75,000 (R. 38\u201339). They have\none car and her husband is responsible for paying the loan. She does not have money in a savings\naccount. They have about $100 in a joint checking account. She has about $178 in an individual\nchecking account. She has a 401(k) retirement account with her employer, but she has taken loans\nagainst it in the past. She estimated a balance of less than $100 in the 401(k) account. Applicant has\ntaken on a second job to earn more money. She has worked the second job for about one year. \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. It is established by two credit\nreports (Exhibits 2 and 3). For example, a December 2005 credit report shows a judgment, 8 of the\n11 trade accounts contain derogatory information, and there are 4 collection accounts (Exhibit 3).\nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged that all the debts in the SOR were valid debts for which\nshe was responsible to pay. Some were incurred by her children, but she was responsible for the\naccount.  She has made some efforts to resolve the debts in the SOR. The status of indebtedness is\nsummarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013judgment entered in September\n2002 for $3,109.\nSatisfied or paid (Exhibits 5, B, and C).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f\u2013medical accounts\nin collection for $100, $23, $75, and $760.\nClaims she paid the $75 account and the\nothers are unpaid.

No\ndocumentation.\nTo sum up, Applicant presented documentary proof-of-payment for 2 debts, and the other 12 are\nunresolved or unpaid. \nIn addition, Applicant presented documentary proof that she satisfied a judgment in April\n2003 (Exhibit A). The judgment was taken in May 2000 for the total sum of $3,732. It was taken by\nthe same creditor (a nationally-known department store) as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and\n1.k. At hearing, Exhibit A was mistakenly identified as proof-of-payment for the judgment in\nsubparagraph 1.a. Closer review establishes that Exhibit A does not concern the debt in\nsubparagraphs 1.a or 1.k. And the judgment in Exhibit A does not appear in either credit report\n(Exhibits 2 and 3), and it is not alleged in the SOR. \nHer security-clearance application reflects a period of unemployment from her current\nemployer (Exhibit 1). She was laid off in April 1998 and called back to work five months later. Her\nhusband works for the same company and he was laid off during 2002\u20132003. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n5\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n15\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\n18\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \n Examples of other large bureaucratic institutions that rely heavily on documentation include banks, insurance\n19\ncompanies, hospitals, universities, and the Armed Forces. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n20\n6\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHer history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n16\n17\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nThe most pertinent mitigating condition is the second MC  of Guideline F. It receives\n18\nconsideration because of Applicant\u2019s five-month layoff in 1998, her husband\u2019s unemployment during\n2002\u20132003, and their separation. Taken together, these circumstances no doubt limited her ability\nto meet her financial obligations. But Applicant receives limited credit in mitigation because her\nlayoff was relatively short and took place several years ago, as did her husband\u2019s unemployment.\nThe same can be said for the separation. By now, sufficient time has passed to allow Applicant and\nher husband to overcome these circumstances. \nThe other MCs under the guideline have been considered and none apply. In particular, the\nrecord evidence is insufficient to establish that she has made a good-faith effort to resolve her\nindebtedness. She presented documentary proof that she paid or resolved 2 of the 14 debts. And she\npresented documentary proof that she satisfied a judgment (not alleged in the SOR) in 2003.\nAlthough she has made some efforts to address her indebtedness, her efforts have been uneven (see\ntable). What is missing here is a realistic, comprehensive plan that addresses Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness as a whole. \n  \nIn addition, given the lack of documentation, her various claims and representations about\npaying or settling the debts in the SOR cannot be accepted. Large bureaucratic institutions\u2014like the\nDefense Department and the security-clearance programs it administers\u2014do not run on word-of-\nmouth.  They run on documentation. The documentation can be stored electronically or on paper,\n19\nbut it is up to Applicant to produce reliable evidence, to include documentary evidence, to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by her and proven by the credit reports.  Although\n20\nApplicant is not legally required to produce documentary evidence to prevail, the lack of\ndocumentation in a financial case makes it difficult to reach a favorable decision under the clearly-\nconsistent standard. \n  \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. She has a history of unresolved financial\nproblems and it is too soon to tell if she will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner.\nApplicant did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\n\n7\nIn reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

However, the record did not establish that she falsified her clearance application.\nClearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 9 August 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended and\n1\nmodified\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\n2\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 6 September 2007 (and\n1\ndates following), and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 25 October 2007, and I\nconvened a hearing 29 November 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 7 December 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAt hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s previously submitted motion to amend the SOR\nby adding subparagraph 2.c. (Tr. 13). I also left the record open until the close of business 7\nDecember 2007 to submit documentation of any claimed payments to her creditors or evidence that\nthey were discharged in her bankruptcy (Tr. 125-126). On 6 December 2007, Applicant submitted\nresponsive documents, to which Department Counsel raised no objection. Accordingly, I admitted\nApplicant\u2019s submission as A.E. C.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the financial allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.e. Accordingly,\nI incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She denied falsifying her clearance application. She\nis a 36-year-old systems management technologist for a defense contractor since April 2005. She\npreviously held a clearance with two different employers in the 1990s. Her background was also\nbeing investigated for a clearance in 2004, however, the processing stopped when the company she\nwas employed by lost the contract.\nWhen Applicant submitted her clearance application in July 2006 (G.E. 1), she answered\n\u201cyes\u201d to a question (question 27 b.) asking if she had had any repossessions in the last seven years.\nShe disclosed a June 2005 automobile repossession with an $18,725 deficiency balance. She also\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to two questions (questions 28 a. and b.) asking if she had been 180 days delinquent\non any accounts  within the last seven years, or was currently 90 days delinquent on any account. In\nthe two spaces allotted on the form, she disclosed the debts at SOR 1.h. and 1.j. with the kind of\ndetail (account numbers and business entities) that could only have come from a credit report.\nApplicant testified credibly that she attached a copy of her credit report to her application, because\nshe knew from past experience the importance of providing complete answers on clearance\napplications.\nDespite the information in the credit report she provided, Applicant is alleged to have\nfalsified her clearance application by failing to disclose the other past due debts alleged in the SOR,\nas well as a paid judgment at SOR 1.b.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to 2000, the point at which she\nbegan to lose control of her finances. She cites no precipitating event for her financial difficulties,\nexcept for being a single mother of two, and living beyond her means. \n\n3\nApplicant acknowledges that she incurred each of the debts alleged in the SOR, and at some\npoint stopped payment on each account (Tr. 38-40). It appears that most, if not all, the debts alleged\nin the SOR\u2014and specifically the automobile repossession deficiency (SOR 1.d.)\u2014were discharged\nin bankruptcy in June 2007 (G.E. 4, A.E. C). However, Applicant produced no evidence of financial\ncounseling, or a personal budget to demonstrate that it was unlikely that she would continue to have\nfinancial difficulties. Between September 2001 and June 2004, Applicant was consistently late with\nher rent, and her landlord just as consistently reduced the past-due rent to judgment (G.E. 5, 6, 7),\nwhich she eventually paid. The credit reports contradict her claim that she always did so within a\nmatter of days or weeks (Tr. 37-41). Around July 2001, Applicant bought a $22,000 new car at over\n21% interest, on a six-year note. Almost immediately, she began to miss payments or make late\npayments, incurring late fees and additional interest. After three years of payments, she discovered\nthat she had only reduced the principal balance to $18,725. The car was voluntarily repossessed in\nSeptember 2004 and sold, resulting in a deficiency balance of $11,300 that she was unable to pay\n(A.E. C). Although an earlier background investigation was terminated in 2004 before her clearance\nwas adjudicated, Applicant knew that she had financial problems and that those problems were of\nsecurity concern to the government (G.E. 8). She is currently on a repayment plan for back taxes,\nstate and federal, that she incurred when she would stop having taxes withheld from her paychecks\nanytime she need extra cash flow to keep up with day-to-day expenses (Tr. 103-105).\nHer character references (A.E. C) consider her honest and trustworthy.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v.

[or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n4\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. The government alleged nearly $25,000 of delinquent debt, as\nwell as $6,000 in paid judgments. Her June 2007 bankruptcy discharge was for over $43,000 in\nunsecured claims. Applicant acquired those debts since 2000, because she could not or would not\nlive within her means.  She also owed over $6,000 in past due state and federal taxes that could not\n3\nbe discharged.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed there is no clear evidence that they have ended.\n4\nApplicant has not established that her debts were due to circumstances beyond her control, or that\nshe has acted responsibly in addressing her debts.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit\n5\ncounseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge gives\n6\nher a clean financial slate as of June 2007, but she produced no evidence to demonstrate that she was\ncapable of handling her finances, and it is too early to tell whether the fresh start afforded her by her\nbankruptcy discharge will be successful.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will\n7\nbe able to remain financially stable in the future. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E. The\njudgment at SOR 1.b. was paid at the time Applicant completed her clearance application, and I\naccept her testimony that she attached a copy of her credit report to her application, as permitted by\nthe application. That report would have disclosed essentially the same debts as appear on the August\n2006 credit report used by the government (G.E. 7).  Further consideration of the Guideline E\n8\nmitigating conditions is unnecessary. I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.\n\n5\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

He is married and has\ntwo children born in the U.S. He returned to Iran on two occasions to visit his incapacitated mother.\nHe has destroyed his Iranian passport, renounced all ties to Iran and intends to never return.\nApplicant has successfully mitigated all security concerns raised under Guideline C, foreign\npreference and Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant is not a security risk. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nTr. 28.\n1\nTr. 23, 28, 36.\n2\nTr. 27.\n3\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 28, 2007\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (foreign preference)\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered\nthe SOR in writing on September 12, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was assigned to me on November 16, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I\nconvened a hearing on December 11, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered two\nexhibits that were marked as GE 1-2 and admitted without objection. The Government also\nrequested I take Administrative Notice of official U.S. State Department documents that were\nmarked as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant did not object and I took administrative notice of the\ndocuments. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered two exhibits that were marked as AE\nA-B and were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December\n17, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior scientist who has worked for a defense contractor since\n2003. He is married and has two children. Applicant was born in Iran and moved to the U.S. in 1977\nto study and obtain an advanced degree. He holds a doctorate in physics and prior to his federal\nemployment he taught physics at several universities.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1989.\n1\nHis wife was born in Iran and is also a naturalized citizen of the U.S. Both of his children, 11 and\n7 years old, were born in the U.S. and are citizens. \nApplicant vehemently denies he is a dual citizen of Iran and the U.S.  He does not consider\n2\nhimself a dual citizen and specifically stated that when he became a U.S. citizen he pledged his\nallegiance only to the U.S. He has lived in the U.S. for 31 years and considers all of his emotional\nties to be to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are deceased and her only sibling, a sister, lives in\nCalifornia. She has no contact with anyone from Iran.\nApplicant\u2019s mother was a permanent resident of the U.S.  She  split her time living with both\n3\nApplicant and his brother, who lived in New Jersey, for periods of six to nine months and then about\nevery 18 months she would return to Iran for a couple of months. On her last trip to Iran in 1991, she\nbecame ill and was unable to travel back to the U.S. She developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease about five\n\nTr. 39-40.\n4\nTr. 37-38.\n5\nTr. 25.\n6\nTr. 32, 42.\n7\nAE A.\n8\nTr. 40-41, 50.\n9\nTr. 42-44, 47.\n10\nTr. 26.\n11\nId. and 31, 40.\n12\nTr. 34-35.\n13\n3\nyears ago and remained in Iran until her death two months ago. During the past several years her\ndisease progressed and she was unable to recognize any of her children.  \n4\nApplicant felt a duty and obligation of a loving son to visit his mother in Iran. He had not\nreturned to Iran for 18 years. Iran would not issue him a visa because he was born in Iran and was\nnow an American citizen.  He was frightened they would harass him because he had changed his\n5\nname from a traditional Muslim name to a traditional American name.  Applicant was required to\n6\nobtain an Iranian passport if he wanted to visit his sick mother in Iran. Applicant obtained an Iranian\npassport and visited his mother twice before her death. His stays lasted approximately 12-14 days.\nHe did not return for her funeral.  With his mother\u2019s passing, Applicant has no desire or sense of\n7\nduty to return to Iran and has destroyed his expired Iranian passport by shredding it on December 6,\n2007, in the presence of his security manager.  He intends to never return to Iran. He was unaware\n8\nof a formal procedure to renounce any ties to Iran due to his birth there, but he is willing to comply\nwith such, if they exist.  \n9\nWhen his mother was living, Applicant offered to his siblings living in Iran, money to assist\nin the care of his mother. They told him they did not need the money and that she was being cared\nfor. However, as a gesture of affection and concern for his mother he sent them approximately\n$1,000 a year.  \n10\nApplicant has two brothers and a sister who are citizens and permanently live in Iran. None\nof them worked for the government of Iran. They are all retired and do not receive government\npensions. They are 71, 65 and 63 years old respectively. Applicant has offered to sponsor them to\nimmigrate to the U.S., but none is interested in moving at their age.  Applicant does not feel\n11\nobligated to them in anyway because he has made the offer. He contacts them approximately twice\na year, once on the Persian New Year and again on their birthday.  He also has a sister who is a\n12\nCanadian citizen who lives in Canada, but visits Iran about once a year, because she has property that\nshe checks on. Her husband is deceased.  Applicant has two other brothers, one is a U.S. citizen\n13\n\nTr. 48-49.\n14\nAE B.\n15\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006; Iran, U.S. Department of State Bureau of Democracy,\n16\nHuman Rights, and Labor, dated March 6, 2007 (Country Reports on Human Rights) at 1, 7.\nBackground Note: Iran, U.S. Department of State Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, dated June 2007\n17\n(Background Note) at 7.\nCountry Report on Human Rights at 20.\n18\nBackground Note; Country Reports on Terrorism 2006, U.S. Department of State Office of the Coordinator\n19\nfor Counter-Terrorism, dated April 30, 2007 (country Report on Terrorism). .\nCountry Report on Terrorism, at 2.\n20\n4\nliving in New Jersey, and the other is a Canadian citizen living in Toronto.

He has demonstrated enthusiasm,\ninsight and a keen sense of dedication in advancing the programs in support of national security. He\nis seen as a person with integrity and coupled with his talented, inventive and unique skills he is\nconsidered a valued employee.15\nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in which\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is vested in\na learned religious scholar.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.  The\n16\n17\nPresident\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated that the United States \u201cmay face no greater\nchallenge from a single country than from Iran.\u201d18\nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as:\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction;\n\u2022\nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism;\n\u2022\nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; \n\u2022\nIts dismal human rights record; and\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.19\nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\nIran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups.  \n20\nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the\nIranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, including\nof minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention, including\nprolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe restrictions on civil liberties-speech,\npress, assembly, association, movement and privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion;\n\nId.\n21\nTravel Warning: Iran, U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, dated May 31, 2007.\n22\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The children of Iranian citizens are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since\nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. As a result, U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained\nand harassed by the Iranian government.  \n22\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n23\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n24\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201c only upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n25\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n26\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n27\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n28\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n29\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.30\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\n\n6\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nForeign Preference\nForeign Preference is a security concern when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate\na preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nBased on all of the evidence I have considered Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition\n(FP DC) 10(a) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation, of foreign citizenship after becoming\na U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member; This includes but is not limited\nto (1) possession of a foreign passport\u2026). Applicant is recognized as a citizen of Iran because he was\nborn there. After becoming a U.S. citizen he obtained an Iranian passport and traveled to Iran on two\noccasions to visit his ailing mother. I find the above disqualifying condition applies.\nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC). I especially\nconsidered FP MC 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry), FP MC 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship),\nand FP MC 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority,\nor otherwise invalidated). Applicant is considered a citizen by Iran because he was born there.\nHowever, he also acknowledged his citizenship by obtaining and validating his Iranian passport after\nhe became a U.S. citizen. So his citizenship is not based solely on his birth, but also by his later\nactions of using his Iranian birth to obtain an Iranian passport. I find FP MC 11(a) does not apply.\nIt is important to note that Applicant obtained an Iranian passport for the sole purpose of visiting his\nsick mother and not for any political or other reason. He felt a duty and obligation as a loving son\nto visit his mother. He did so on two occasions. Applicant credibly testified that he does not consider\nhimself a dual citizen and when he became a U.S. citizen he renounced his Iranian citizenship. Iran\u2019s\n\n7\nregulations required him to obtain a passport if he wanted to see his mother before she died. He does\nnot intend on ever returning to Iran. He has destroyed his Iranian passport in the presence of his\nsecurity officer. He is willing to follow any requirements Iran may impose on him to formally\nrenounce any perceived ties he may have with that country. I find FP MC 11(b) and (c) apply. \nForeign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) and\nespecially FI DC 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and FI DC\n7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict\nof interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information).\nApplicant has two brothers and a sister living in Iran with whom he speaks twice a year. He has a\nsister who is a Canadian citizen, who travels to Iran annually. Applicant traveled to Iran in 1999 and\n2002. Iran is a country that has a poor human rights record and terrorist components creating a\nheightened risk of foreign influence. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) especially (FI\nMC 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with the foreign person, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), FI MC (b) (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest), and FI MC 8(c) (contact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk\nfor foreign influence or exploitation). Applicant visited Iran twice to see his mother since becoming\na U.S. citizen. His mother has died and he credibly testified that he will never return to Iran. He had\nprovided his siblings with money for his mother in the past, but with her passing this is no longer\nan issue. He has brothers and a sister who are citizens and residents of Iran. At one time, Applicant\noffered to sponsor them to immigrate to the U.S. They did not want to and Applicant does not feel\nany moral obligation to them. He has minimal contact with them twice a year to wish them greetings\non the new year and for their birthday. He has contact with his sister in Canada who travels to Iran.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s total and unconditional obligation and commitment is towards his wife and\nchildren in the U.S. His contact with family members who have ties with Iran is casual and\ninfrequent. He never intends to return to Iran and believes he has fulfilled his moral obligation by\n\n8\nhis offer to sponsor his siblings. Applicant has no interest in Iran and has infrequent contact with his\nrelatives there. His sense of loyalty is exclusively to the U.S. His wife and children are U.S. citizens\nand he sees no reason why he would return or feel compelled to take action to aid Iran. He has no\nfinancial or business interests in Iran. He has been a U.S. citizen for 18 years and but for his mother\nbecoming ill he would likely have never returned. All of Applicant\u2019s trips to Iran were prior to him\napplying for a security clearance. There is little likelihood that Applicant has any conflict of interest,\nbut if he did it is clear, due to his longstanding loyalty to the U.S. and the likely minimal nature of\nthe conflict, he would resolve it in favor of the U.S. I find all the above mentioned mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant is a loyal American who returned to his\nbirth country because his mother was ill. His mother is deceased and although he has some family\nremaining in Iran his contacts are infrequent. Applicant\u2019s life is now and has been since 1977\nconnected to the U.S. Iran required he obtain a passport for entry to visit his mother. He visited her\nin Iran twice before she died. He has since destroyed his passport and is willing to renounce his\ncitizenship and any ties with Iran. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines C and B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence. I\nfind Applicant is not a security risk. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Bednar, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s positive test for cocaine metabolite in October 2005 was mitigated by the\ncircumstances and results of the test, and his demonstrated intent not to use any drugs in the future.\nThe record did not establish that Applicant falsified his clearance application.

He answered the SOR 3 August 2007, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 6 September 2007, and I convened a hearing 1 November 2007.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 13 November 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nApplicant requested, and was granted for good cause, a continuance from the originally\nscheduled hearing date to 1 November 2007, to permit him time to obtain the laboratory litigation\nreport supporting the positive test for cocaine metabolite (A.E. B), and obtain expert analysis of that\nsupporting documentation (A.E. C). At hearing, I denied Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to Amend\nthe SOR because the proposed amendment was unnecessary (Tr. 88).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted testing positive for cocaine use in October 2005 (SOR 1.b), being fined\nfor minor consuming alcohol in 1993 (SOR 3.a.), and being given a suspended jail sentence, fined,\nand ordered to community service for a misdemeanor charge in 1996 (SOR 3.c.). He denied the\nremaining allegations of the SOR, specifically that he had ever used cocaine (SOR 1.a.), or falsified\nhis clearance application (SOR 2). Accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 34-year-old systems analyst employed by a defense contractor since May\n2006\u2014seeks access to classified information. He appears to have held a clearance since 1997.\nIn October 2005, Applicant reportedly tested positive for cocaine metabolite on a pre-\nemployment drug screen for a previous employer (A.E. A). The company had inadvertently started\nhis employment before receiving the results of the drug screen (G.E. 9), and he was suspended from\nwork while the sample was retested and the company decided what to do with Applicant if the retest\nconfirmed the positive result. While the results of the retest were pending, the company discussed\nwith Applicant re-assigning him to a sister company, where he would work on the same programs\nwith the same supervisory personnel. He would not require a clearance, but would be required to\npass a drug screen. When the sample retested positive for cocaine, Applicant resigned from that\ncompany (A.E. G), and was immediately hired by the sister company. He passed the entry drug\nscreen. He worked for this company from October 2005 to February 2006 as a systems analyst.\nIn May 2006, Applicant went to work for his current employer, and he completed and\nexecuted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (E-QIP)(A.E. F) to begin his\nbackground investigation. He reported his current employment, a period of unemployment from\nFebruary 2006 to May 2006, and his employment with the sister company from October 2005 to\nFebruary 2006. He did not report the 22-day employment with the first company, nor did he report\nany illegal drug use. In his October 1997 clearance application (G.E. 1), he disclosed\u2014and had a\nfavorable adjudication of\u2014a 1993 charge of minor consumption of alcohol, for which he was fined\nand given a military non-punitive letter of reprimand, and a 1996 misdemeanor conviction for\n\n3\ninterfering with rights of others. This latter charge was resulted from a bar fight at a private home.\nApplicant was identified as part of the group that started the fight, although he himself did not\nparticipate. Applicant received a suspended jail sentence, a fine, and was ordered to perform\ncommunity service\u2014which he completed.\nIn July 2006, Applicant was requested to execute a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (QNSP)(SF 86)(G.E. 2), and he did so. However, he credibly stated that while he had\nlooked over the document before signing it, he had not generated the entries therein as he had when\nhe completed the E-QIP. Cursory comparison of the May 2006 E-QIP and the July 2006 QNSP\nreveal the QNSP to be both incomplete and incorrect. Although I accept Department Counsel\u2019s\nproffer that DOHA received only the QNSP and not the E-QIP (Tr. 22), Department Counsel neither\nproffered nor produced an explanation why this was so.\nApplicant is alleged to have falsified the July 2006 QNSP by failing to disclose his\ninadvertent 22-day employment (SOR 2.a.), failing to disclose his termination from this employment\nbecause of his positive drug test (SOR 2.b.), and failing to report his illegal drug use (SOR 1.c.). The\ngovernment also alleges that these falsifications violate federal law (SOR 3.d).\nApplicant and his wife testified at hearing, and I found their testimony credible and I believe\nit. They have known each other for 18 years, have been together for 10 years after Applicant got out\nof the Army, have been married for five years, and have two children, ages one and two. Applicant\nis actively involved as a parent, attends church, and participates in sporting activity. His wife has\nnever known him to use illegal drugs. He received the report of the positive drug screen at home, and\nimmediately informed his wife and his employer. The employer\u2019s focus turned almost immediately\nto having Applicant re-assigned to the sister company, so Applicant never had any real thought that\nhe was being terminated from the first company. He resigned from the first company to facilitate his\nre-assignment to the sister company.\nApplicant\u2019s character references (A.E. E) consider him honest and trustworthy. However,\nnone of them are aware of the issues raised in the SOR. The nanogram level of Applicant\u2019s positive\ntest for cocaine metabolite (A.E. A, B) was 170, on a confirmatory test (radio immunoassay) accurate\nto 150. This level of metabolite, depending on circumstances, is consistent with innocent or\nunintentional ingestion of cocaine (A.E. C).\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe revised adjudicative guidelines specify factors to be considered when evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nAny drug abuse [\u00a7 25.(a)]; Testing positive for illegal drug use [\u00a7 25.(b)];\n3\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\n4\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment [\u00a7\n26.(a)][Emphasis supplied];\nA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: . . . (2) changing or avoiding the\n5\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; . . . [\u00a7 26.(b)].\n4\nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a potential case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating that Applicant tested positive for cocaine use in October 2005.  The positive drug test\n3\npermits me, but does not require me, to conclude that Applicant knowingly used cocaine. Under the\ncircumstances of this case, I conclude that Applicant did not knowingly use cocaine. However,\nexamining the evidence most favorably to the government, Applicant mitigated the security\nconcerns, by demonstrating that the use was infrequent, under circumstances unlikely to recur, and\n(as a single incident) does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.  He further demonstrated intent to not abuse drugs in the future.  At best, Applicant\n4\n5\nused cocaine on a single occasion in October 2005, with no illegal drug use before or after. In the\ncontext of his drug abuse, that use is not recent, and his nearly two years of abstinence from cocaine\nuse from December 2005 to November 2007\u2014is an appropriate period of abstinence [\u00a7 26.(b)].\nOrdinarily, Applicant\u2019s failure to admit his cocaine use in the face of his positive drug test might\nsuggest that he has not demonstrated rehabilitation. However, in this case Applicant has reasonable\ncause to not admit what he vehemently disputes. In any event, on this record, even if I believed\nApplicant use cocaine knowingly, it is extremely unlikely that he would return to illegal drug use.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline H. for Applicant.\n\nApplicant\u2019s conduct did not involve deliberate omission. . . [\u00a7 16.(a)], deliberately providing false or\n6\nmisleading information . . . [\u00a7 16.(b)], personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability . . . [\u00a7 16.(e)], violation of a\nwritten or recorded commitment . . . [\u00a7 16.(f)], or association with persons involved in criminal activity [\u00a7 16.(g)].\n5\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E. Applicant\u2019s\nMay 2006 E-QIP disclosed his employment with the sister company, using employment dates that\ncover the entire 22-day inadvertent employment by the first company. The record evidence shows\nthat the sister company utilized the same supervisory chain and worked on the same projects and\ncontracts. On the facts of this case, I doubt Applicant even thought of this period of time as\nconstituting two different employers. Similarly, I would not expect Applicant to think of the\ncircumstances of his resignation from the first company as leaving under unfavorable circumstances.\nNor would I expect him to admit to cocaine use based on the results of a drug test that he vehemently\ndisputes (and that his employer apparently considered sufficiently unreliable that it sought alternate\nmeans to keep him as an employee). Thus I conclude that Applicant completed the May 2006 E-QIP\n(and I note that the E-QIP is the most current clearance application in use) completely and truthfully,\nand did not intend to mislead the government in any way. Having completed this application\ntruthfully, I conclude Applicant could not have intended to mislead the government when he\ncompleted the July 2006 QNSP\u2014a clearance application format last revised in September\n1995\u2014even though he signed it without noting the significant errors and omissions between it and\nthe May 2006 E-QIP. Even accepting that DOHA did not have the E-QIP, and that Applicant\u2019s\nbackground investigation was conducted based on the QNSP, the government has produced no\nexplanation how or why Applicant was given an outdated, incomplete form to sign two months after\nthe more complete, more current application. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.6\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline J. The\ngovernment failed to produce any evidence to support the charge of minor consumption of alcohol\nin 1994 (SOR 1.b.), and the 1993 charge of minor consumption of alcohol and the 1996\nmisdemeanor interference charge have even less security clearance significance now than they did\nin 1997, when they were first favorably adjudicated for Applicant. These two charges add nothing\nto this case standing together, or in conjunction with the felony allegation of SOR 1.d. SOR 1.d. is\nbased on the three falsification allegations of paragraph 2 which I found for Applicant. Accordingly,\nI find Guideline J for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

RIVERA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in the United States. His father was a U.S. Army soldier assigned to\nGermany who retired in Germany after 24 years of service. His mother is a German citizen.\nApplicant grew up and was educated as a German citizen. He is 30 years old and has lived the last\n24 years of his life exercising the rights, privileges, and obligations of a German citizen. Applicant\u2019s\nties and connections to Germany are stronger than his ties and connections to the United States. His\nfavorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the foreign influence and foreign preference\nsecurity concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n1\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n  Applicant had sufficient time to prepare for his hearing and was ready to proceed. I find he had more than\n2\n15 days notice of his hearing. Furthermore, he affirmatively waived his right under the Directive to have 15 days hearing\nnotice. \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The SOR informed Applicant that based on\navailable information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and\nsubmitted the case to an administrative judge for a security determination.  On June 27, 2007,\n1\nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nApplicant is a resident of Germany. During the week of August 20, 2007, Applicant and\ndepartment counsel attempted to schedule Applicant\u2019s hearing in the United States to correspond\nwith Applicant\u2019s scheduled training trip to the United States. However, the training was cancelled.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 29, 2007. On or about September 4, 2007, Applicant elected\nto have his hearing conducted via video tele-conference (VTC). On September 19, 2007, a Notice\nof Hearing was issued convening a VTC hearing on September 26, 2007.  The hearing was convened\n2\nas scheduled. The government presented one exhibit, marked GE 1, to support the SOR. At his\nhearing, Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of one witness (no\nexhibits). DOHA received the transcript on October 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the allegations under Guidelines B and C, except for \u00b6 1.c, which he\ndenied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of\nApplicant\u2019s testimony and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of facts.\nApplicant\u2019s father was born in the United States. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in February\n1973, and sometime thereafter, was assigned to Germany. While in Germany, he met and married\nApplicant\u2019s mother, a German citizen. Later, his father was reassigned to a base in the United States,\nwhere Applicant was born in June 1977. His sister was also born in the United States in 1982 (Tr.\n27, 29). \nIn 1983, when Applicant was approximately six years old, the Army reassigned his father\nback to Germany. Applicant\u2019s father served in the U.S. Army in Germany until he retired in March\n1997. After his retirement, he was hired by an American company providing support to the Army\nin Germany. \n\n3\nApplicant considers himself a citizen of Germany and the United States (Tr. 28, 69). He was\nraised and educated within the German culture. As a German citizen, he attended German schools\nfree of charge (Tr. 35). In 1997, he completed the equivalent of a junior college education. In\nSeptember 1997, he was conscripted into the German Army where he served until June 1998. After\nhis discharge from the German Army, Applicant underwent three and one-half year of apprenticeship\nas an industrial electronics technician (Tr. 38-41). From September 1998 to February 2004,\nApplicant worked for at least four different German companies and had several periods of\nunemployment. He received unemployment benefits from the German government during his periods\nof unemployment. In February 2004, Applicant was hired as a training technician by his current\nemployer, the same U.S. defense contractor that employs his father and provides support for U.S.\ntroops in Germany (Tr. 49). \nAs a German citizen, Applicant contributes to the German health care and insurance system,\nto his retirement plan, unemployment benefits, and church tax. He is allowed to vote in German\nelections, however, he has never done so (Tr. 55-57). Applicant is single and has no children. He\nlives in the German economy with his German girlfriend, whom he would like to marry in the near\nfuture. He has a German bank account and a $2,000 car note. Applicant does not have a German\npassport. He does have, however, a German citizen identification card that allows him to travel\nthroughout the countries within the European Union (EU). In 2005-2006, he traveled to Tunisia\nusing his German citizen identification card. He also has a U.S. passport which he has used to travel\nto countries outside of the EU (Tr. 50-51).\nApplicant believes there is no practical reason for him to renounce his German citizenship\n(Tr. 28). After leaving the United States at age six, he visited the United States one time for his\ngrandfather\u2019s funeral. He never registered with the U.S. Selective Service System. He has no\nproperty, business, or financial interests in the United States. Applicant\u2019s sister is married to a U.S.\nsoldier. She was living in the United States with her husband until he was deployed to Iraq. She is\ncurrently living with her parents in Germany waiting for her husband\u2019s return.\nApplicant testified that although his mother is German, he has stronger ties to the United\nStates than to Germany because he was born in the United States, his father was an American\nsoldier, and his sister is married to a U.S. soldier. He explained he has remained in Germany because\nhe does not have the resources to travel and begin a new life in the United States (Tr. 37). He has\nonly one friend in the United States, a dual citizen who recently returned to the United States. Except\nfor this friend, all of Applicant\u2019s friends are citizens and residents of Germany. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take\ninto account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\n\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\n3\nperson concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of \u201cthe nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d\n  See Department of the Navy v.

A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n4\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it is\n5\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution\n6\nof any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor\nof protecting national security.7\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that foreign contacts and\ninterests may be a security concern. If the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6.\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. In\nthis case, the most pertinent is:\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\nApplicant\u2019s ties and connections to Germany are stronger than his ties and connections to the\nUnited States. His connections to the United States are summarized as follow: his father is an\nAmerican, Applicant was born in the United States, he has a U.S. passport, his sister is married to\na U.S. soldier, and he works for an American company. Applicant has no other connections to the\nUnited States. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s connections to Germany are substantial. He has lived\nin Germany since age six, and was raised and educated as a German citizen. He served in the\nGerman Army (albeit as a conscript and for 10 months), and all of his financial/economic interests\nare in Germany. Applicant\u2019 s girlfriend and almost all his friends are Germans. Additionally,\nApplicant has received benefits reserved for German citizen such as a German identification card,\nand educational and unemployment benefits. He also contributes financially and is entitled to\nbenefits from the German welfare, medical, and retirement systems. \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising the potentially disqualifying\ncondition, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nTwo foreign influence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the\ndisqualifying condition:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and\n\n6\nI note that Germany is an open society, governed as a freely-elected democratic republic, with\na representative legislature, a periodically-elected chancellor as the executive leader, and an\nindependent judiciary. Germany is not known to engage in human rights abuses or other oppressive\nconduct towards its citizenry. While it differs, as allies sometimes do, with the United States on a\nnumber of issues, Germany has, since 1945, generally aligned itself with U.S. foreign policy,\nmilitary, and commercial interests. As such, I believe it would be unlikely that Applicant will be\nplaced in a position (by force or pressure) of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or the German government and the interests of the U.S., and AG \u00b6\n8(a) applies.\nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s favorable information is not sufficient to warrant the\napplicability of AG \u00b6 8(b). Applicant has not established a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the\nUnited States, to show that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nUnited States\u2019 interest. As mentioned above, his connections to Germany are stronger than his\nconnections to the United States. Applicant has lived most of his life as a German citizen. All of his\nfinancial and business interests are in Germany, and he has embraced the German way of life. \nUnder Guideline C (Foreign Preference), the government\u2019s concern is that when an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.\nApplicant considers himself a dual citizen of the United States and Germany. His home is\nin Germany where he has lived since age six, and where he was raised and educated as a citizen. He\nserved in the German Army, and all of his financial/economic interests are in Germany. Applicant\u2019s\ngirlfriend and almost all his friends are Germans. Applicant has received benefits reserved for\nGerman citizens such as a German identification card, a free education, and unemployment benefits.\nHe also contributes to the German welfare, medical, and retirement systems, and is entitled to those\nbenefits. His actions constitute an exercise of dual citizenship and raises security concerns under\nGuideline C. Foreign preference disqualifying condition AG 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege\nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship\nof a family member. This includes . . . (2): military service . . . for a foreign government; and (3):\naccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign\ngovernment, apply.\nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I conclude\nthat none of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 apply. Applicant\u2019s security concerns arose out\nof his exercise of the rights, privileges, and obligations of a German citizen. His German citizenship\nis not based solely on his mother\u2019s citizenship. He has not offered to renounce his German\ncitizenship. He has willingly and knowingly exercised his rights as a German citizen since age 18.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s and his father\u2019s\ntestimony. I considered his father\u2019s 24 years of honorable, military service to the United States, that\nas a child, Applicant had no choice but to be with his parents, and that he has remained in Germany\nbecause his father\u2019s military service and retirement in Germany. Considering all available\n\n7\ninformation, and the whole person concept, I find Applicant\u2019s available information is not sufficient\nto mitigate the foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive\nSection E3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b, & 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on March 26, 2008. On April 30, 2008, he was interviewed by an \nauthorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and provided \ninformation, under oath, about his financial obligations. On December 31, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 21, 2009. He answered the SOR \nallegations but did not indicate whether he wished to have a hearing or a decision on \nthe record. When this omission was brought to his attention, Applicant indicated on \nFebruary 19, 2009 that he wanted a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The \nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 16, 2009. The \nFORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated March 17, \n2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit \nany additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant \nreceived the file on March 23, 2009.  His response was due on April 22, 2009. He did \nnot file additional information within the required time period. On May 15, 2009, the case \nwas assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains nine allegations of financial delinquency under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all nine of the Guideline F allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nentered herein as findings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and employed as a network administrator by a \ngovernment contractor. He is a high school graduate and studied at the college level for \napproximately one semester. From 1996 to 2000, he served in a U.S. military National \nGuard unit. After he was honorably discharged in 2000, he served for an additional two \nyears in an inactive status, but was not called to duty. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1996. (Item 3; Item 6; Item 8.)  \n \n \nApplicant married in 2006, and he and his wife are the parents of two young \nchildren.  Applicant\u2019s wife is employed outside the home. Applicant has been steadily \nemployed since 2001. (Item 3; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother and mother became ill sometime in 2004 or 2005.  \nApplicant took an unspecified amount of unpaid leave to care for his mother and \ngrandmother. Both family members died in 2006. Applicant\u2019s older child received a \n$100,000 insurance payout when his mother died. His daughter can access this money \nwhen she reaches her 18th birthday.  (Item 8, 16-18.)   \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator in April 2008, he stated \nthat he anticipated receiving a tax refund of approximately $1,800, which he intended to \nuse to pay off some of his creditors. He also reported he would use approximately \n$5,000 from his 401K plan to satisfy his debts. Applicant reported a monthly net \nreminder of $400. However, an unspecified amount of the monthly net remainder was \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nnot used to satisfy debts but to help family members who have financial needs. (Item 8 \nat 16.) \n \n \nThe nine delinquent accounts alleged on the SOR and admitted by Applicant \ntotal approximately $22,793. Applicant\u2019s credit report reflects that these accounts \nbecame delinquent between 2003 and 2008. His largest debt is a credit card \ndelinquency of $15,113, which was placed for collection in July 2006. Applicant is \nresponsible for a student loan account of $4,554 that was 120 days delinquent as of \nApril 2008 and remained unsatisfied as of October 2008. Two of his delinquencies \nrepresent amounts of less than $1,000 each, and five of the debts are for amounts of \nless than $500 each.1  (Item 1; Item 3; Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation to show that he had made payments on the \ndebts alleged in the SOR, although in his September 2008 response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, he stated he would pay some of them in the future. He also provided \ndocumentation corroborating his statement that he had settled and paid in full a debt of \n$8,057 resulting from the repossession of an automobile and the threat of court action \nagainst him. This debt was not alleged in the SOR. Nothing in the record establishes \nthat Applicant has sought and received consumer credit counseling.  (Item 8, 3-9.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n1 The debt alleged at SOR \u00b61.a. was for approximately $158. The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. was for \napproximately $291, and the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. was for $160. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Between 2003 and 2008, Applicant accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20(d)).  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least the period \nof 2003 to 2008. Moreover, the delinquencies remain unpaid and have occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur. He has not sought consumer credit counseling \nthat could provide him with strategies for resolving his delinquent debts. While he \nsettled a delinquency that was not alleged in the SOR, he did so only in response to \nthreatened court action. \n \nApplicant appears to have resources sufficient to pay or settle his delinquent \ndebts, and he has failed to do so. While he stated that he took unpaid leave to attend to \nhis mother and grandmother when they were seriously ill, he did not specify how much \nleave he took, when he took it, or how it specifically impacted his financial situation. The \nrecord does not reflect that the circumstances that gave rise to his delinquencies were \nbeyond his control. Applicant expressed his intent to pay some of his debts in the future. \nHowever, in determining an individual's security worthiness, the Government cannot rely \non the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her outstanding debts at some \nfuture date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I conclude that AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not mitigate the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  I also \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable.2 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n \n2 AG \u00b6 20(e) reads: \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute \nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(f) reads: \u201cthe [unexplained] affluence \nresulted from a legal source of income.\u201d \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult.  He has \nbeen steadily employed since 2001 and reports a net remainder each month of \napproximately $400. While he took an unspecified amount of unpaid compassionate \nleave to care for his family members, this occurred at least three years ago. In his April \n2008 interview with an authorized investigator, he stated he would use his 2007 income \ntax refund to pay or settle some of his debts. Despite some financial strength, Applicant \nhas failed to satisfy over $22,000 in delinquent debts, several of which are for relatively \nsmall amounts of money. His failure to satisfy his creditors raises security concerns \nabout his judgment and reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after \nthe date that this decision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence \nthat addresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n__________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old and was employed by a defense contractor for over four years as a service desk technician serving in a war zone with the US Armed Forces. She left that position in June 2010 when she returned to the United States. She has served three tours in a war zone for defense contractors. She married in August 1976 and divorced in May 1995. She remarried in May 2000 and divorced in February 2006. She married again in October 2010. She has two grown children. She is not presently employed, but her former employer is holding a position for her pending a decision on her eligibility for access to classified information. Since she is not employed, there is no information on her present salary. Since she recently married, she is supported by her husband and does not work outside the home. Prior to her termination pending the resolution of her eligibility for access to classified information, Applicant received a good salary and had significant discretionary funds each month since she was working overseas in a war zone and had little if any expenses.

Applicant did not present sufficient information to \nmitigate security concerns for financial considerations and personal conduct.   \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) to obtain a security clearance for employment with a defense contractor on \nNovember 1, 2005. She was granted access to classified information. On January 28, \n2010, Applicant submitted a new e-QIP to update her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. After an investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued interrogatories to \nApplicant to clarify or augment potentially disqualifying information in her background. \nAfter reviewing the results of the background investigation and Applicant's responses to \nthe interrogatories, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative findings required \nto issue a security clearance. DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nSeptember 10, 2010, to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F and personal conduct under Guideline E for \ninformation not provided on both e-QIP. These actions were taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 29, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2010. She admitted two and \ndenied 19 of the allegations under Guideline F. She denied the allegations under \nGuideline E. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 21, 2011, and the \ncase was assigned to me on March 21, 2011. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nMarch 21, 2011, scheduling a hearing for March 23, 2011. I convened the hearing by \nvideo teleconference as scheduled. The Government offered nine exhibits that I marked \nand admitted into the record without objection as Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 \nthrough 9. Applicant testified on her behalf and offered no exhibits. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 6, 2011. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing until the day of the hearing. She \ndiscussed the hearing date with Department Counsel and requested an early hearing \ndate. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advanced notice of a hearing. (Directive E3.1.8.). \nApplicant was ready to proceed at the hearing on March 23, 2011, and she was \nprepared to proceed. She waived the 15 days notice requirement. (Tr. 6-7) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and was employed by a defense contractor for over four \nyears as a service desk technician serving in a war zone with the US Armed Forces. \nShe left that position in June 2010 when she returned to the United States. She has \nserved three tours in a war zone for defense contractors. She married in August 1976 \nand divorced in May 1995. She remarried in May 2000 and divorced in February 2006. \nShe married again in October 2010. She has two grown children. She is not presently \nemployed, but her former employer is holding a position for her pending a decision on \nher eligibility for access to classified information. Since she is not employed, there is no \ninformation on her present salary. Since she recently married, she is supported by her \nhusband and does not work outside the home. Prior to her termination pending the \nresolution of her eligibility for access to classified information, Applicant received a good \nsalary and had significant discretionary funds each month since she was working \noverseas in a war zone and had little if any expenses. (Tr. 59-63; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, \ndated January 27, 2010: Gov. Ex. 4, Response to Interrogatories, dated March 27, \n2007) \n \nCredit reports of August 3, 2010 (Gov. Ex 5), May 12, 2009 (Gov Ex 6), August 2, \n2007 (Gov. Ex. 7), and March 2, 2007 show the following delinquent debts for Applicant: \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmedical debts of $7,796 (SOR 1.a), $1,275 (SOR 1.b), $542 (SOR 1.c), $252 (SOR \n1.d), $542 (SOR 1.p), $537 (SOR 1.q), $32 (SOR 1.s), $30 (SOR 1.t), and $20 (SOR \n1.u); collection accounts for $468 (SOR 1.e), $358 (SOR 1.f), $10,000 (SOR 1.i), $920 \n(SOR 1.l), $1,094 (SOR 1.n), $598 (SOR 1.0), and $148 (SOR 1.r); judgments for \n$1,240 (SOR 1.g), and $984 (SOR 1.k); and charged off accounts for $5,645 (SOR 1.h), \n$541 (SOR 1.j), and $7,118 (SOR 1.m). The total amount of the delinquent debt listed is \napproximately $40,000. Applicant admitted the delinquent debts listed at SOR 1.a, and \n1.e. She denied the other debts.   \n \nIn response to interrogatories and questions from security investigators, \nApplicant attributes most of her debts to being laid off in 2002, and a divorce in 2006. \nShe also noted that some of the debts were the debts of a former husband and not her \ndebts. She was not aware of a majority of her debts and does not remember when and \nwhy they were incurred. Applicant denied the debts in the SOR because she could not \nremember or verify them, or believed she was not responsible for them since they were \nattributed to her former husband. She was unemployed from October 2002 until June \n2003, November 2004 until November 2005, and May 2006 until November 2006. She \nwas employed in a war zone overseas for a defense contractor from November 2006 \nuntil July 2010. Her pay was good while she was employed overseas. (Tr. 19-20, 43-49, \n61-67; Gov. Ex. 3, Response to Interrogatories and Transcript of Interview, dated March \n15, 2010)  \n \nApplicant testified the $7,796 medical debt at SOR 1.a was for surgery she \nreceived in 2003 or early 2004. Prior to the surgery, she saw a promissory note from her \ninsurance company to the hospital that the insurance company would be responsible for \npayment of the hospital bill. She did not receive a copy of the note. She has not been in \ncontact with the hospital about the debt because she spent most of the last few years \nworking overseas in war zones. (Tr. 22-24) \n \nApplicant has no knowledge of the $1,275 medical debt at SOR 1.b. It is possible \nthe debt resulted from her surgery. She paid the surgeon for his services directly so it is \nnot a bill from him. She had limited contact with creditors concerning the debt because \nshe was serving overseas. She contacted the hospital in 2006 and was informed that \nthe hospital no longer had the debt since it was in collection. She did not contact a \ncollection agency for the debt. (Tr. 24-26)  \n \nApplicant has no knowledge of the medical debts alleged in SOR 1.c and 1.d. \nShe admits the $468 telephone debt at SOR 1.e and believes the debt belongs to her \nformer husband. The account was in her name but both used the phone. When they \ndivorced, her former husband kept the phone account. She did not receive any bills \nsince she moved. She contacted the company in 2006 and was informed the debt had \nbeen written off and they could not accept any payments. She has not paid the debt. \n(Tr. 26-28) \n \nApplicant believes the $358 cable debt at SOR 1.f was for service she received \nprior to 2006. She believes all bills, including this one, had been paid. She had service \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwith the company after 2006 which she would not have received if she owed a debt to \nthem. She has no receipts for any payments on cable debts. (Tr. 28-29) \n \n \nThe $1,240 judgment at SOR 1.g and the $984 judgment at SOR 1.k are for a \ncar engine repair in 2002. Applicant took her car to a repairman for an engine problem. \nThe day after she got the car back, the engine failed so she stopped payment on the \ncheck used to pay the bill. The repairman filed a claim in small claims court. Applicant \ncountered with a claim of her own. The magistrate directed that both parties absorb their \nown costs. However, both judgments were charged to Applicant. Applicant has no \ndocuments to show the magistrate's ruling. Applicant claims the two judgments were the \nresult of these claims. The judgment at SOR 1.g was filed in August 2002 and lists the \nautomobile repairman as the claimant. The judgment at SOR 1.k was filed in March \n2001 and lists the claimant as a person with Applicant's same last name but a different \nfirst name. Applicant was informed by court personnel that the name on the judgment at \nSOR 1.k was written incorrectly. Neither judgment has been paid. I find that the \njudgments pertain to the automobile repair and are resolved as noted in the small \nclaims court. (Tr. 29-31, 35-36) \n \nThe $5,645 debt at SOR 1.h is for a car voluntarily returned to the dealer for \nrepossession. When Applicant lost employment she was unable to make payments on \nthe car so she returned it to the dealer. She has not paid the debt nor made any \narrangement to pay the debt. (Tr. 31-33) \n \nApplicant does not have any knowledge of the $10,000 debt at SOR 1.i. She \nbecame of aware of the debt in July 2010. She made no inquiry about the debt after \nreceiving the SOR in September 2010. Since it is not now on her credit report, she has \nnot made any further inquiries about the debt. (Tr. 33-34) \n \nApplicant has no knowledge of the $541 credit card debt at SOR 1.j. This debt \nmay be the same debt noted at SOR 1.l since they are credit card debts from the same \nissuing bank. She does not think she or her former husband had a credit card issued by \nthe listed creditor bank. She believes she and her former husband had a credit card \nissued by another bank but the debt was paid. She has not discussed this credit card \ndebt with the issuing bank. I find that debts SOR 1.j and 1.l are the same debt but have \nnot been resolved. (Tr. 34-37) \n \nThe $7,118 debt at SOR 1.m is for a computer purchased by Applicant. When \nApplicant was laid off in about 2002 she was unable to continue to make payments on \nthe debt. She has taken no action to learn about or pay the debt. (TR. 37-38) \n \nApplicant claims she paid the $1,094 debt at SOR 1.n years ago. She has no \ndocumentation to show the payment. She has not inquired about the debt from the \ncreditor. (Tr. 38-39) \n \nApplicant has no knowledge of the $598 medical debt at SOR 1.o, the $542 \nmedical debt at SOR 1p, and the $537 medical debt at SOR 1.q. She called one of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncreditors a few years ago to inquire about the debt. She did not have an invoice \nnumber, so she was unable to identify the debts for the creditor. She has not paid any of \nthese debts. (Tr. 39-41) \n \nThe $148 credit card debt at SOR 1.r was opened in her name by her son. He \nmade the purchase that is the subject of the debt. She has not paid the debt. (Tr. 41-43) \n \nApplicant has no knowledge of the $32 medical debt at SOR 1.s, the $30 medical \ndebt at SOR 1.t, and the $20 medical debt at SOR 1.u. She has not taken any action to \npay the debts. She has paid some recent medical debts. (Tr. 43) \n \nApplicant completed her first e-QIP on November 1, 2005. In response to a \nquestion concerning her police record, she answered \"no\" to all questions at section 23 \nparticularly questions asking if she had ever been convicted of an offense related to \nalcohol or drugs. She failed to list her arrests and charges for driving while intoxicated in \nOctober 1997 and 2001, and a public intoxication arrest in 2002. (Gov. Ex. 9, Criminal \nJustice Report, dated, December 1, 2005) In response to questions concerning her \nfinances, she answered \"no\" to question 27d asking if she had any judgment she had \nnot paid. There are two judgments against her as noted at SOR 1.g and 1.k. She \nanswered \"no\" in response to question 28a asking whether in the last seven years she \nhad any debts more than 180 days delinquent. She answered \"no\" to question 28b \nasking if she presently had any debts more than 90 days past due. As noted in the \ncredit reports and the SOR, at the time she had debts more than 180 days past due. \n(Gov. Ex. 2)  \n \nApplicant denied that she deliberately provided false information. Applicant first \ncompleted a security clearance application on a computer disc while serving overseas \nin approximately 2003. She thought the 2005 e-QIP was merely an update of her \nprevious application. She cannot explain why she did not include her 1997 driving while \nintoxicated offense in response to the relevant question. When she answered the \nfinancial question concerning judgments, she did not know a judgment had been \nentered against her because the magistrate ruled each party was responsible for their \nown expenses. In response to the questions concerning delinquent debts, she did not \nknow at the time she had delinquent debts even though she was just coming off a \nperiod of unemployment. (Tr. 54-59, 70-71) \n \nApplicant completed her second e-QIP on January 28, 2010. In response to \nquestions concerning her police record, she answered \"No\" to question 22e asking if \nshe had ever been charged with any offense related to alcohol or drugs. However, she \nanswered \"Yes\" to question 22b asking if she had ever been arrested by law \nenforcement. She listed a 2002 driving while intoxicated offense. She failed to list a \n2002 public intoxication offense and a 1997 driving while intoxicated offense. In \nresponse to questions concerning her finances, she answered \"No\" to all financial \nquestions under section 26. This section in various questions asks Applicant if she ever \nhad any bills turned over to a collection agency or had any credit cards suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failure to pay as agreed, or had or has delinquent debts. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe credit reports and SOR show collection and charged off credit card accounts. (Gov. \nEx. 1)  \n \nApplicant denied deliberately providing false or incomplete information on her \nJanuary 28, 2010 e-QIP, Applicant listed only a 2002 driving while intoxicated offense \nand not the 1997 driving while intoxicated offense, or the 2002 public intoxicated \noffense. Even though she was initially charged with a felony assault and battery, she \nbelieved she did not have to include the public intoxication offense since the conviction \nwas only a misdemeanor. The felony assault and battery charge was dismissed. She \ndid not list any felony charges in response to any question on the application. She did \nnot remember the felony assault and battery charge since it was dropped. Her only \nexplanation for failing to include the 1997 driving while intoxicated offense was that she \ndid not remember the incident. As to her finances, she did not have the opportunity to \nexamine a credit report before completing the form, and she did not remember what \ndebts were outstanding. She did not think about looking into the state of her finances to \nanswer the questions since she was completing the application while serving overseas \nin a war zone. (Tr. 49-54, 67-70, 72-78) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as that meets her \nfinancial obligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts as established by a credit reports are \na security concern. The evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under Financial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions do not apply. Most of the debts \nlisted in the SOR have not been resolved and are current. The debts were incurred in \nthe late 1990s before her second marriage, during the marriage, and continued after her \nsecond marriage ended in divorce in 2006. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhen she was unemployed for about eight months in 2002/2003, for a year in \n2004/2005, and for six months in 2006. While it is clear that there was a divorce and \nperiods of unemployment, Applicant provided no explanation how the circumstances \nprevented her from continuing to pay her debts and manage her finances. She \npresented no information concerning the steps she took to live within her means while \nunemployed. Even though she had periods of unemployment, the circumstances \nleading to her unemployment were predictable and not unusual. She worked on specific \ntime period contracts overseas that she knew would be completed within a certain time. \nShe presented no information to show how she managed her finances under the \nconditions of this type of employment.  \n \n \nApplicant has not established that she took responsible actions to resolve her \ndebts. She was employed from 2006 until June 2010 with good pay and considerable \ndiscretionary funds to use to pay debts. During this time, she made little if any effort to \ncontact creditors or pay debts. She used the excuse of being overseas and having \ndifficulty contacting creditors. She presented no information to show that she made \nattempts to contact creditors but was not successful because of her location and \nsituation. \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). The mitigating condition does not apply. While Applicant \ncould benefit from financial counseling, she presented no information to establish she \neven considered or attempted financial counseling.  \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. Good-faith means acting in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty and obligation. A \nsystematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant must establish a \"meaningful \ntrack record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment can be \nestablished by evidence of actual reduction of debt through debt payment. An applicant \nis required to demonstrate that she has an established plan to resolve her financial \nproblems and has taken significant action to implement that plan. Applicant presented \nno information to establish her intent or method to resolve her delinquent debts. She \nhad sufficient income to pay debts from November 2006 until July 2010. She made little \nif any effort to resolve the debts when she had the funds. She is married now, but not \nemployed, and seems to have some means of paying some of her debts. Applicant has \nnot shown she acted with reason and prudence towards her debts. She has not \ndemonstrated that she has or will act responsibly towards her debts and they are not \nunder control. Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised for personal conduct based on Applicant's responses \nto financial questions on her security clearance applications. Personal conduct is a \nsecurity concern because conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern because it \nasks whether the person\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted \nto properly safeguard classified information. The security clearance system depends on \nthe individual providing correct and accurate information. If a person conceals or \nprovides false information, the security clearance process cannot function properly to \nensure that granting access to classified information is in the best interest of the United \nStates government.  \n \n \nApplicant completed two security clearance applications, one in 2005, and the \nother in 2010. On both applications, she provided inaccurate and incomplete answers to \nquestions concerning her police record and her finances. Applicant's incorrect answers \nto these questions raises a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying \nCondition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness). Applicant denied an intentional falsification for the incorrect or missing \nmaterial information on both applications. While there is a security concern for an \nomission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral \nstatement to the government when applying for a security clearance, not every \nomission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is a falsification. A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully with intent to \ndeceive. \n \n \nIn response to questions on the 2010 application, Applicant listed only one of \nthree alcohol-related criminal offenses. She did not believe she had to list a felony \narrest for assault and battery involving alcohol since she was only convicted of a \nmisdemeanor for public intoxication. She listed only one of two arrests for driving while \nintoxicated in response to a general question concerning arrests, but not in response to \na specific question concerning alcohol-related arrests. While it is reasonable to believe \nApplicant was confused about the public intoxication offense, this was a conviction for \nan alcohol-related offense, and should have been listed on the application. There was \nno confusion that she had two driving while intoxicated offenses. There was no time \nlimit for listing the offense. In addition, Applicant answered \"no\" to questions concerning \nher finances indicating that she had no financial problems of security concern. \nApplicant's explanation was she did not consult a credit report before answering \nfinancial questions and did not know the details of her financial problems. However, \nApplicant was unemployed a few times before completing the application. She had to \n\n \n10 \n \n \nrealize she accumulated debt during this time and had not made any attempts to pay \nthe debts since becoming fully employed in November 2006. It is reasonable to \nconclude that she should know she had debts that were unpaid old debts. Her failure to \nlist the 1997 driving while intoxicated offense or to note that there were any financial \nissues can only be classified as a knowing and willful failure to provide required \ninformation with intent to deceive. Applicant has not presented sufficient information to \nshow her omissions were not deliberate.  \n \n \nApplicant answered \"no\" in response to all questions concerning her police \nrecord on the 2005 application. These questions have no time limit concerning alcohol-\nrelated arrests. She did not list either driving while intoxicated offense or the public \nintoxication offense. As noted above, she has not provided sufficient information to \nshow why she could not remember her arrests for driving while intoxicated. These types \nof encounters with law enforcement are memorable and one happened only three years \nbefore she completed the application. Her conviction for public intoxication is clearly an \nalcohol-related offense and should have been so noted. Her only confusion would be in \nresponse to question 23a concerning felony arrests since she was only convicted of a \nmisdemeanor. She failed to list any financial problems of security concern. It is \nreasonable to believe she did not know of an unpaid judgment since the magistrate \nruled that both parties were responsible for their own bills. However, it is not reasonable \nto believe she did not know of unpaid delinquent debts. She was unemployed for a time \nand did not or could not pay her debts for a time. She should have reasonably realized \nshe had debts more than 180 days past due. Applicant mitigated security concerns for \npersonal conduct under SOR allegation 2.d concerning judgments. She has not \npresented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for the other personal \nconduct allegations.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n11 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has \nwillingly served as a civilian in war zones in support of United States Armed Forces and \nhas been granted eligibility for access to classified information in the past.  \n \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt that she has not resolved or satisfied. She did \nnot present sufficient information to establish that her financial problems were caused \nby conditions beyond her control. She did not establish that she made good-faith efforts \nto resolve her finances and pay her past due obligations. Applicant has not established \na \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including evidence of actual debt reduction \nthrough payment of debts. Her efforts to resolve her finances have only been minimal at \nbest. She made limited inquiries concerning her finances and presented no evidence of \ndebt payments. She has not presented enough information to show she is taking \nreasonable and responsible action to resolve her financial issues. Her management of \nher finances shows carelessness and unconcern. This indicates she will be \nunconcerned, irresponsible, and careless regarding the safeguarding of classified or \nsensitive information. Applicant's failure to take adequate action to resolve her debts \nestablishes that she is not suitable for a security clearance. Applicant provided \nincomplete or inaccurate financial information and alcohol-related arrest information on \ntwo security clearance applications with intent to deceive. Her deliberate actions in not \nproviding accurate information shows she will not properly safeguard classified \ninformation. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from her personal conduct and her financial situation. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. She should not be granted access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g;  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h - 1.j; \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k;  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.j) \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m- 1.q:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.s - 1u: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a -2.c \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant (a U.S. citizen by birth) has worked on defense projects that required a security clearance for most of the past 20 years he has been employed in the defense industry (R.T., at 70- 71). He is quite familiar with the practices of other countries trying to collect industrial and sensitive information and is regarded as a mentor at his company on foreign economic collection issues (R.T., at 74, 78-79). Applicant met his spouse (W) in early 2001 through a mutual friend who had immigrated to the U.S. about 10 years before (R.T., at 40-42) . He exchanged correspondence with W in 2000 before she met Applicant personally during a family visit to the U.S. in 2001 (R.T., at 42, 81). Applicant reciprocated and traveled to Taiwan in August 2001 to see W. After a brief courtship, Applicant and W were married in Taiwan in April 2002 (R.T., at 43).

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant (a U.S. citizen by birth) has a wife with dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S.\nMembers of her immediate family (i.e., her father and three siblings) are citizens of Taiwan and\nreside there.  His much larger commitments to the U.S. enable him to  mitigate any potential risk to\nundue foreign influence concerns under Guideline B. Taiwan, while a country reported to gather\neconomic and proprietary intelligence against the U.S. and its companies, retains strong mutual\nstrategic interests with the U.S.  Taiwan is a country with a history of democratic traditions and\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law.   Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 5, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on September 20, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on October 30, 2007.  A\nhearing was convened on October 30, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on two\nwitnesses (including himself) and four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on November\n7, 2007.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of nine documents:\nBackground Note: Taiwan, U.S. Department of State (April 2007); Taiwan: recent Developments\nand U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress (October 2006);\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2000,\nNational Counterintelligence Center; Press Release, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (WD\nNY April 2006); Press Release,  U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED VA January 2007);\nStatement of Facts [stipulated], United States v. Keyser, Crim. Case No.1:05CR543, (ED VA\nDecember 2005); Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) (June 2004); Background Note: China, U.S. Department of State\n(January 2007); 2006 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\n(November 2006); Focus on Economic Espionage, FBI, Investigative Programs, Counterintelligence\nDivision.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 (App.\nBd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports\nthat are well known.   See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good\ncause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named  background reports\naddressing the geopolitical situation in Taiwan.  Administrative notice was extended to the\ndocuments themselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed..R. Evi.  This notice did\nnot foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained\nin the reports addressing Taiwan\u2019s current state.  \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAt the outset of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to substitute\nbrother for brother-in-law in sub-paragraph 1.e and delete the allegation of Applicant\u2019s travel to\nTaiwan in February 2007 in sub-paragraph 1.f  of the SOR.  There being no objections, and good\ncause being demonstrated, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was granted.  With the requested\nsubstitutions approved, Applicant admitted allegations 1.e and 1.f in their entirety.\n\n3\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have a wife who is a dual citizen of Taiwan\nand the U.S.; (b) a father-in-law who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan, and who was employed by\na Taipei city government from approximately 1957 to 1986; \u00a9) a brother-in-law who has been\nemployed as an associate professor at a Taiwan medical center), his wife and their two sons who are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan; (d) a sister-in-law (who has been employed by a Taiwan\nenvironmental protection administration since May 1982), her husband and their children who are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan; and (e) a second  brother-in-law who is a citizen and resident of\nTaiwan.  Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have traveled to Taiwan in August 2001, April 2002,\nFebruary 2005, and February 2007.  His wife is alleged to have visited Taiwan in August 2005. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations.  He denied his wife\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan; he claimed\nhe is her brother, not her brother-in-law.  He also denied traveling to Taiwan in August 2005; he\nclaimed his wife (not he) traveled to Taiwan at that time.  He claimed three of his wife\u2019s relatives\n(i.e., his father-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law have applied for immigration to the U.S.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 47-year old systems engineer  for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant (a U.S. citizen by birth) has worked on defense projects that required a security\nclearance for most of the past  20 years he has been employed in the defense industry (R.T., at 70-\n71).  He is quite familiar with the practices of other countries trying to collect industrial and sensitive\ninformation and is regarded as a mentor at his company on foreign economic collection issues (R.T.,\nat 74, 78-79).\nApplicant met his  spouse (W) in early 2001 through a mutual friend who had immigrated\nto the U.S. about 10 years before (R.T., at 40-42) .  He exchanged correspondence with W in 2000\nbefore she met Applicant personally during a family visit to the U.S. in 2001 (R.T., at 42, 81).\nApplicant reciprocated and traveled to Taiwan in August 2001 to see W.  After a brief courtship,\nApplicant and W were married in Taiwan in April  2002 (R.T., at 43). W, in turn, immigrated to the\nU.S. in September 2002 to live with Applicant (R.T., at 43).  Once in the U.S., she applied for U.S.\ncitizenship.  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2006 and obtained a U.S. passport the\nfollowing month (R.T., at 66-67).   Before immigrating to the U.S., W  was a licensed nurse in\nTaiwan.  Once she arrived in the U.S. with Applicant, she applied for and obtained a registered\nnursing license.  She has been unsuccessful, though, in obtaining nursing employment in the U.S.\n(R.T., at 44).  \n\n4\nSince immigrating to the U.S., W has  made several return trips to Taiwan.  She made trips\nto Taiwan in 2002 (accompanied by Applicant) and 2003  to care for her ailing father (R.T., at 44-45,\n81).  Since she did not yet have a U.S. passport, she used her Taiwan passport for both trips.  In\nFebruary 2005, Applicant and W traveled together to Taiwan to see her father and siblings.  She\nreturned to Taiwan six months later (in August 2005) for a surgical procedure and remained in\nTaiwan for a brief period to recuperate under the care of her family (R.T., at 45).  She returned to\nTaiwan one more time in February 2007 to see her family. On this trip, she used her U.S. passport\n(R.T., at 66-67).  While she retains her Taiwan passport, which is not scheduled to expire for another\n10 years (R.T., at 67-68), she has no intention of using it in future travels to Taiwan.\nW\u2019s father survived her mother and  is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.   Her father has lived\nand worked all of his natural life in Taiwan. Before retiring in 1986 (at the age of 76), he was\nemployed as a health inspector for a Taipei city government department of health (R.T., at 46-47).\nHe currently receives monthly retirement benefits from the Taiwan government (R.T., at 47).\nApplicant and W have since returned to Taiwan on several occasions to care for W\u2019s father during\nperiods of illness.  She has regular telephone contact with her father (R.T., at 49), but neither\nApplicant or herself provide any financial support to him (R.T., at 47).  W\u2019s father  has come to visit\nApplicant and W2 on several occasions (i.e.,  in 2002, 2003 and 2004).  \nW\u2019s brothers and sister have spent time in the U.S.   One brother studied at a prestigious\nAmerican university in the 90s and currently is on the medical faculty of the prestigious Taiwan\nNational Defense Medical Center (R.T., at 49-51).  His wife is employed in the economics\ndepartment of the Taiwan government (R.T., at 53-54).  This brother accompanied W's father on his\nlast visit in 2004, and applicant maintains regular telephone contact with him (R.T., at 51-52). \nBesides her aforementioned brother, W has a sister (age 50) who is both a citizen and resident\nof Taiwan.  She is employed as an administrative assistant for a Taiwan environment agency (R.T.,\nat 57-58).  Her husband works for a private Taiwan company.\nW has another brother (older than the first) who is also a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  As\na polio survivor, he requires a wheel chair to ambulate and works only on small tasks.  He  receives\ngovernment disability benefits and will need to remain in Taiwan to retain his benefit eligibility\n(R.T.,at 60-61).  His wife sells chewing gum (R.T., at 60).  Applicant talks regularly (every week or\ntwo) to her sister and first  brother, but has little contact with her oldest brother.  Applicant himself\noccasionally speaks to W\u2019s family members (usually just to exchange greetings), but never about any\nsubstantive topics that involve his work (R.T., at 81-82).  He recalls one instance in which he\nreviewed a draft of his brother-in-law\u2019s academic paper intended for publication in a medical journal\n(R.T., at 82-83).   His face to face interactions with his in-laws have been limited to those few\noccasions he met with them while traveling with W to Taiwan and during the several visits of W\u2019s\nfamily members to the U.S.\nW, with Applicant\u2019s support, has filed immigration applications on behalf of her father,\nsister, and younger brother in March 2007 (see exs. A through C; R.T., at 47-48, 51, and 56).  She\nexpects the immigration process to be completed  in less than a year for her father, but not for a\nnumber of years in the cases of her brother and sister (R.T., at 56-57).  She is considered very\nknowledgeable, patriotic towards the U.S. (her newly adopted home), and a solid contributor to\nAmerican society as a nurse by those with Applicant\u2019s employer who have to come know her (see\n\n5\nex. D).  Neither Applicant nor W know of any reason why W's family members could be at risk of\ncoercion or pressure from any members of the Taiwan intelligence or military organizations (R.T.,\nat 65).\nApplicant is highly regarded by his colleagues at work.  Both his human resources specialist\nand his site manager credits him with outstanding performance, reliability and trustworthiness (ex.\nD).  His strong ethics have made him one of his company\u2019s most trusted and valuable employees.\nHe is considered technically gifted, a dedicated team player, and a solid performer who is always\nconscious of security requirements.  Applicant\u2019s facility clearance officer (FSO) credits him with\ndemonstrating a strong sense of duty and responsibility toward proprietary, sensitive, and classified\ninformation.   His FSO reports that  he has never committed a security violation.  In recognition of\nhis demonstrated loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness, Applicant is scheduled by his company to\nbe deployed to Iraq in early 2007 (see ex. D).\nTaiwan\u2019s country status\nTaiwan has a rich history that dates back 12 to 15 thousand years.  Dutch and Spanish\ncolonists claimed the island in the 16  and 17  centuries (see Background Note: Taiwan, U.S.\nth\nth\nDepartment of State (April 2007)).  Migration from the Chinese mainland over time supplanted the\naborigines peoples of Taiwan.  Japan exerted considerable influence over Taiwan following China\u2019s\nceding of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan reverted to Chinese rule.  Civil war\nerupted soon after the reversion between Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s KMT government and the increasingly\ninfluential Chinese Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong.  When the civil war ended in 1949,\n2 million refugees (predominantly nationalists) fled to Taiwan, where Chiang Kai-Shek established\na separate provisional KMT capital in Taipei (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3). Mao\u2019s\nvictorious Communist party, in turn, established the People\u2019 s Republic of China (PRC).\nFor the past one-half century, Taiwan has demonstrated steady economic development and\ntoday is a major international trading power.  Its accession to the WTO in 2002 represented a\nsignificant achievement and strengthened its standing in the expanding global economy. \nTaiwan has exhibited steady political development as well since its establishment as an island\ngovernment.  Changes reflect a continuing liberalizing process that culminated in the tightly\ncontested election of Chen Shui-bian in 2000 (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3).   Chen\u2019s\nDPP party won major parliamentary victories in 2000 and again in 2004, enabling Chen to become\nthe first opposition party candidate to win the presidency.  Chen was re-elected in 2004 on a platform\nthat included a \u201cdefensive referendum\u201d (Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).   Such referenda\nhave been historically perceived to be closely linked to the question of Taiwan\u2019s independence.\nToday\u2019s Taiwan political system can appropriately be described as a multi-party democracy\nunder a Constitutional umbrella comprising five branches: executive, legislative, judicial, control\nand examination.  By all accounts, Taiwan has a good human rights record and demonstrated respect\nfor the rule of contract in its commercial relations.\nTaiwan\u2019s PRC relations\n\n6\nThe PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is only \u201cone\nChina\u201d (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Despite differences over the PRC\u2019s one China\npolicy, Taiwan and the PRC have enjoyed increased contacts over the past decade.  With Taiwan\u2019s\ncontinued relaxation of its PRC policy regarding unofficial contacts, cross-strait interactions have\ngrown significantly.  Efforts by the PRC, however, to resume cross-strait dialogue without any\npreconditions have been hampered by the PRC\u2019s insistence that the two sides first reach consensus\nthat there is only \u201cone China\u201d before restarting talks (see id.).  Cheng has recognized the PRC\u2019s \u201cone\nChina\u201d insistence but to date has declined to condone the concept.  With both sides unwilling to\ncompromise this obstacle, they have cautiously felt each other out with smaller intermediary steps\nlike cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights, sale of Taiwan agricultural products in the PRC,\nand PRC tourists visiting Taiwan (see id).  \nThe PRC operates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the MSS (see\nIntelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency OPSEC Support\nStaff (IOSS), at 71 (June 2004).  The MSS maintains active intelligence gathering operations in\nTaiwan (see id., at 72).  These operations use clandestine agents to collect intelligence on Western\nconsortia investing in the PRC who are suspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the\nPRC, as well as other pro-democracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities (see\nIntelligence Threat Handbook, supra, at 72)\nU.S.-Taiwan relations\nIn a joint communique with the PRC in January 1979, the U.S. announced its recognition of\nthe government of the PRC as the sole government of China and that there is but one China, of\nwhich Taiwan is a part (see Background Note; China, U.S. Department of State, at 8 (January 2007).\nThe Joint Communique stated that within this context the people of the U.S. will maintain cultural,\ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.\nTo implement the Joint communique, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) in\nApril 1979.  President Carter, in turn, signed the legislation into law on April 10, 1979.  Besides\nproviding the legal basis for maintaining the U.S. unofficial relationship with Taiwan, the TRA\nreinforced the U.S. commitment to providing defense assistance to Taiwan.  The TRA expressly\nprovides for the continued sale of appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan and declares\nthat peace and stability in the area are in U.S. interests (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 9).\nAnd even though the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan following its de-\nrecognition of the latter, it has continued its sale of appropriate defensive military equipment to\nTaiwan (see id.).\nWhile ambiguously written, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan\u2019s security against cross-Strait\naggression by the PRC\u2019s military forces is implicit in the TRA\u2019s coverage of U.S. responsibilities\ntowards Taiwan.  This implicit construction is oft-used to support proponents of a \u201ctwo China\u201d\npolicy.  To be sure, initial actions of the Bush Administration in 2001 provided cause to conclude\nthe new President had abandoned longstanding U.S. policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in favor of a\npolicy that placed a clearer emphasis on Taiwan\u2019s interests at the expense of the PRC (see Taiwan:\nRecent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, CRS Report to Congress, at 13 (October 2006)).\nMore recent developments, though, reflect the smoothing of U.S.-PRC relations as a part of the\nbroader war on terrorism.  \n\n7\nCurrently, the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral steps by\neither side to alter the status quo (see Background Note; China, supra, at 20).  For so long as\nTaiwan\u2019s national security remains under threat (both veiled and unveiled) from the PRC, Taiwan\ncan be expected to pursue the development of its military amidst expectations of  military assistance\nfrom the U.S.  Stressing self-reliance, Taiwan maintains a large military establishment (accounting\nfor 15.3 per cent of its central budget).  Its principal mission is to defend itself against the PRC,\nwhich has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at\n8).   With its unchanged public policy of maintaining  \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in its official relations\nwith Taiwan, the U.S. can be expected to continue its support of Taiwan\u2019s island security with the\nsale of defensive military equipment.\nTaiwan\u2019s economic collection practices\nBased on past reports to Congress, Taiwan is considered one of the most active collectors of\nU.S. economic and proprietary information.  In its 2000 Annual Report to Congress on Foreign\nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage, the preparers  list Taiwan as well as the PRC among\nthe most active collectors (see 2000 Annual Report  to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\nand Industrial Espionage, National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), at 16).   Specific incidents\nare cited  in the NACIC Report that identify offenders of proprietary information thefts and attempts\nto acquire export-restricted products (see id., 7-10). \nRecent espionage convictions document ongoing collection activities covering theft of\nsensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwan companies (see, e.g., 2006 Report to\nCongress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, at 139 (November 2006); Press\nRelease, U.S. Department of justice, U.S. Attorney (WD NY April 2006); Press Release, U.S.\nDepartment of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED VA January 2007), and Statement of Facts (stipulated),\nNo. 1:05CR 543 (December 2005).   Multilateral export control regimes in place are voluntary and\nnot universally adhered to by member nations (see id., at 143).\nStress points between Taiwan, the PRC  and the U.S.\nIn its November 2006 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission describes the\nPRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge developed by multiples of\ncollection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by espionage (see 2006 Report to\nCongress, supra, at 138.  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to acquire sensitive technology poses a\nconsiderable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence measures.  Recent indictments of Chinese citizens\nfor espionage have served to highlight the PRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating  its\nown 2004 U.S.-China agreement, the PRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of\ndual-use items licensed for export to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they are\nmultilateral in scope (see id.).  Multilateral export controls and arms embargoes, however, do  provide\nadditional insurance against altering the cross-strait military balance that has been long maintained\n(see id., at 144).\nWithout effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be expected to acquire dual\nuse technologies with military potential from the U.S. and Taiwan through the U.S. and other source\ncountries.  Reported intelligence, though, is lacking on any Taiwan use of its collection resources in\n\n8\nthe U.S. to supply the PRC with needed military technology (alone or through technology with known\ndual use capabilities).\nOther stress points between the PRC and Taiwan are reflected in periodic PRC military\nexercises in the Taiwan Straits (see Background Note: China, supra, at 19).  More frequent U.S.-PRC\nhigh-level exchanges have the potential to reduce cross-strait military tensions (id., 19).  \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions),\nif any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance\nshould be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\njudges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered\nthe identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so\nis clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges\nto make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\n\n9\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted\nfacts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security\nworthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth who married a woman (W) in 2002, who historically was\na citizen and resident of Taiwan.  She immigrated to the U.S. shortly thereafter to be with Applicant.\nShe became a U.S. citizen in 2006 and has since petitioned for U.S. immigration approvals on behalf\nof her father, brother and sister (all of whom are citizens and residents of Taiwan).   Security issues\nof concern to the Government focus on members of Applicant\u2019s in-laws (i.e., his wife\u2019s father, sister\nand two brothers)  who are citizens and residents of Taiwan,  a country  historically friendly to the\nU.S., albeit, one with a reported history of economic collection activities in the U.S.\nDepartment Counsel  urges security concerns over risks that W's father and siblings (all\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan) might be subject to undue foreign influence by Taiwanese\nauthorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant\u2019s\nin laws  reside in Taiwan, they present potential heightened  security risks covered by disqualifying\ncondition  (DC) 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) of the\nAdjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  The citizenship/residence status of these non-\nimmediate family members in Taiwan pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks\nof undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information under\nApplicant's possession and/or control. \nBecause of W\u2019s living arrangements with Applicant and her dual status as a citizen of Taiwan\nand the U.S, some consideration of DC 7(b) (connection to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information) and DC 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk or foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) are warranted as well.  W\u2019s contacts with her father\nand siblings, most of whom have been associated with Taiwan government service at the local or\nnational level, afford her some potential for accessing Taiwan officials who might be interested in\nproprietary, sensitive, or even classified information that Applicant is privy to.  Still, none of W\u2019s\nfamily members have any identified affiliations or contacts with Taiwan officials known to be\nassociated with intelligence or military organizations interested in collecting proprietary or sensitive\ninformation in the U.S.\n\n10\nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of W's  immediate family\nresiding in Taiwan have any political affiliations with Taiwan\u2019s government, have any history to date\nof being subjected to any coercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  W's father\noccupied a relatively low non-political position with the Taipei city government before his retirement\nin 1986, and does have a government pension.  One of her two brothers has medical training and\nserves on the faculty of Taiwan\u2019s National Defense Medical Center; while her only sister has long\nbeen employed by a Taiwan environmental protection agency.  None of these recited positions,\nhowever,  involve intelligence or military operations and, as such, are not likely to make any of these\nrelatives foreseeable subjects of interest to Taiwan foreign data collection officials.  Moreover, all but\none of Applicant\u2019s identified extended  family members have an application pending for approved\nimmigration to the U.S.  Taking the explanations of W about her immediate family at face value, any\nrisk of undue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his in-laws would appear to be insubstantial and\nclearly not of the magnitude that could make them subject to a heightened security  risk of pressure\nor compromise under Guideline B.\nTaiwan, although a country reported to have targeted U.S. economic and proprietary interests\nin the past, enjoys a special relationship with the U.S. through the TRA, and is a democratic\ngovernment with a history of respect for human rights and the rule of law.  While Taiwan has been\nan active collector of economic intelligence in the U.S., it has not been known to use acquired\ninformation to harm U.S. strategic interests.  Taiwan remains a member in good standing with the\nWTO and a constructive trading partner with the U.S., who at times has itself been targeted by agents\nof the PRC for intelligence collection on Western groups thought to be promoting democracy and\nengaging in anti-communist activities directed at the PRC.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign\ncountries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be\nin another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case\nbasis, guidelines are available for referencing in the supplied materials and country information about\nTaiwan. \nThe special relationship that has existed between the U.S. and Taiwan over the past half-\ncentury has been one marked by mutually reconcilable political and economic interests.   Reports of\nTaiwan intelligence gathering against U.S. companies are counterbalanced by Taiwan\u2019s history of\nfriendship and partnership in a defense pact formalized in 1979.  The mutually supportive bonds that\nhave linked Taiwan\u2019s special relationship with the U.S. have not been weakened by either the TRA,\nor the  geopolitical forces that have shaped the U.S.\u2019s evolving relationship with the PRC.  Whatever\npotential heightened security risks arise as the result of Applicant's having in-laws with citizenship\nand residency in Taiwan are by every reasonable measure mitigated.  \nTaiwan remains a friend of the U.S. and is a country whose democratic institutions are not\nincompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of law.  Unlike the\nold Adjudicative Guidelines the new ones do take account of the covered country\u2019s demonstrated\nrelations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with\ncitizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk.  The geopolitical aims and\npolicies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter.  Taiwan, while reported to target the U.S.\n\n11\nand its companies in the past for economic and proprietary information, is still a country with no\nknown recent history of hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue influence against family\nmembers to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary data. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's extended family members\nin Taiwan  (a country whose interests have recently been and continue to be friendly to those of the\nU.S.), any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the\nhopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant\nthrough his wife\u2019s family members residing in Taiwan is  an acceptable one.  Applicant, accordingly,\nmay take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC 8(a) (the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the persons or activities of\nthese persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.). \n MC(8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) has application, too, to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.  Both at home and through those in senior positions with Applicant\u2019s employer,\nW has demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S. since becoming\nApplicant\u2019s spouse in 2002, and a naturalized citizen in 2006.  Whatever potential conflicts she may\nhave through her dual Taiwan citizenship and contacts with her family members in Taiwan have been\nmore than counterbalanced by her demonstrated U.S. citizenship responsibilities.  \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has consistently demonstrated his steadfast\ncommitment to respecting and protecting proprietary, sensitive, and classified information.  He is a\ncitizen by birth who has held a security clearance for the better part of 20 years without a security\nviolation.  He is considered an exemplary contributor to his employer and can be expected to\nprioritize his loyalties to his country and commitments to protecting proprietary, sensitive and\nclassified information to which he has access over any potential conflicting interests with members\nof his wife\u2019s family members still residing in Taiwan.  \nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize W\u2019s exposure to conflict of interests with\nher Taiwan family members.  Not only does W reside exclusively with him in the U.S., but she and\nApplicant have made concerted efforts to gain immigration approvals for her father and two of her\nsiblings.  Neither Applicant nor W are aware of any risks of coercion or pressure that any of W\u2019s\nfamily members might be exposed to, and the likelihood of any pressure or coercion being brought\nto bear on any of W\u2019s family members would appear to be minimal at this time.   Put another way,\nApplicant has no visible conflicts of interest with Taiwan citizen/residents or property interests in\nTaiwan that could be at risk to exploitation or compromise by Taiwan military or intelligence\nofficials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members in Taiwan\nare sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand\nrisks of undue influence attributable to his familial relationships in Taiwan.  Favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\n\n12\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, conclusions,\nand the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate formal findings with\nrespect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f::\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nRoger C.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRobert A. Skipworth, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 15, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\n2\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 18, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was made without an adequate evidentiary basis and without consideration of\ncontrary record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is sustainable.  Finding no\nharmful error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings of fact: Applicant was arrested in 1976\nfor DUI and for driving too fast for conditions, causing injuries.  He was convicted of both offenses\nand sentenced to one year probation and to a fine of $250.  He was arrested in 1981 and charged with\nassault upon a military policeman, resisting apprehension, and domestic disturbance.  This incident\noccurred on a military base while Applicant was serving in the armed forces.  He was reprimanded\nby his commander.  The Judge concluded that the evidence as a whole did not support a finding that\nthis was an alcohol-related incident, despite references to alcohol in the police report.\nIn February 1989 Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  He was convicted of that\ncharge in absentia, having failed to appear in court.  In May 1993 Applicant was again arrested for\nDUI, as well as for speeding, improper lane usage, and a safety belt violation.  He was convicted of\nreckless driving and sentenced to 12 months probation and a fine of $1,150.  In May 2002 Applicant\nwas stopped by police for erratic driving and charged with DUI.  He was sentenced to 14 months\nprobation and a $500 fine.  Additionally he was instructed by the court to attend counseling.  \nQuestion 23 of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA), completed in February\n2006, asked him to list any alcohol or drug related charges or convictions.  Applicant mentioned the\nMay 2002 incident but did not disclose the charges arising in 1976, 1989, and 1993.  \nIn April 1992 Applicant submitted a SCA during a prior security clearance investigation.\nQuestion 21 asked for the disclosure of all previous arrests, whether alcohol-related or not.\nApplicant listed his 1989 DUI, but he did not mention the arrests in 1976 and 1981.  Although\nApplicant stated that he had misunderstood the scope of the questions, the Judge found that both\nquestions are \u201cstraight forward,\u201d without any time limitations, and could not  plausibly be so misread\non two separate occasions.  In his analysis section of the decision, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s\ndenial of an intent to deceive was not credible.\nThe Board has examined Applicant\u2019s assignments of error in light of the record as a whole.\nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial\nrecord evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as\na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.\u201d)  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings contain errors, the Board concludes\nthat they are harmless in that they would not reasonably have affected the outcome of the case.  See\n\n3\nISCR Case No. 06-07247 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2008).   Furthermore, we conclude that the Judge\nhas drawn a \u201crational connection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse clearance decision, both\nas regards to his application of the relevant mitigating factors as well as to his whole person analysis.\nSee  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The\nBoard has considered the briefs of the parties, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the record as a whole.  The\nrecord supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\u201d  See Department of the Navy v.

This incident occurred on a military base while Applicant was serving in the armed forces. He was reprimanded by his commander. The Judge concluded that the evidence as a whole did not support a finding that this was an alcohol-related incident, despite references to alcohol in the police report. In February 1989 Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was convicted of that charge in absentia, having failed to appear in court. In May 1993 Applicant was again arrested for DUI, as well as for speeding, improper lane usage, and a safety belt violation. He was convicted of reckless driving and sentenced to 12 months probation and a fine of $1,150. In May 2002 Applicant was stopped by police for erratic driving and charged with DUI. He was sentenced to 14 months probation and a $500 fine. Additionally he was instructed by the court to attend counseling. Question 23 of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA), completed in February 2006, asked him to list any alcohol or drug related charges or convictions.

DOHA recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 6, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 18, 2007, and was scheduled for\nhearing on November 28, 2007.  A hearing was held on November 28, 2007, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of eight  exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses\n(including himself) and seven exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December\n7, 2007.\nJanuary 18, 2008\n\n2\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\n          Before the convening of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the\nSOR.  Specifically,  Department Counsel asked to strike the reference in subparagraph\n1.b to the incident involving Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol and marijuana and replace the\nreference with \u201cYou had been drinking alcoholic beverages prior to this incident.\u201d\nAdditionally, Department Counsel requested the substitution of May for February in\nsubparagraphs 1.d and 2.a(3), and approved striking altogether subparagraph 2.c.  For\ngood cause shown, the requested amendments were approved. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have been (a) arrested, charged, or\ncited with five alcohol-related offenses between 1976 and May 2002.  Those five\noffenses are as follows: (1) in October 1976 for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol\n(DuI) and driving too fast for conditions (with injuries), for which he was convicted and\nsentenced to one year probation; (2) in September 1981 for assault upon a military\npoliceman (a violation of Art. 128 of the UCMJ), resisting apprehension (a violation of\nArt. 95 of UCMJ), and domestic disturbance, which involved his use of alcohol and\nmarijuana (since amended), and for which he received a written reprimand; (3) in\nFebruary 1989 for DuI; (4) in February 1993 for DuI, speeding, improper lane usage,\nand safety belt violation, to which he pleaded  nolo contendere, and was sentenced to\n12 months of probation and fined $1,150.00; and (5) in May 2002 for DuI, for which he\nwas convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail and a fine of $500.00.\nAdditionally, under Guideline G, Applicant  is alleged to have  been (a) evaluated\nby a Mr. C (a licensed clinical social worker) in July 2003, who diagnosed him with\nalcohol dependence and saw him regularly for alcohol treatment group sessions\nbetween July 2003 and May 2004, and (b) diagnosed with alcohol dependence  by a Dr.\nR in June 2007, who recommended discontinuance of alcohol, begin VA Healthcare\nSystem Substance Abuse Treatment Program (VASAT) treatment and attend Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) or similar program.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his security clearance\napplication (e-qip) of February 2006 by listing only a May 2001 DuI offense and omitting\nhis other DuI offenses and (b) falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of April\n1992 by listing only his 1989 DuI arrest and failing to disclose two other alcohol-related\narrests covered by the questionnaire.  He is also alleged to have been fired from a prior\njob for unethical conduct.  \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nprovided explanations of the events and circumstances associated with the alleged\nconduct and claimed to be working on his alcohol problem.  \nFindings of Fact\n        Applicant is a 50 year-old  technician for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are\n\n3\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant was introduced to alcohol in high school.  Following his enlistment in\nthe Army in 1974,  he increased his consumption of alcohol (R.T., at 64).  He generally\ndrank two to three times a week, and on the occasions he drank, his consumption\nvaried from a 12-pack or six-pack of beer per sitting (R.T., at 64).  After 23 years of\nmilitary service, he retired with an honorable discharge in 1997.            \n Over a period of 25 plus years Applicant was involved in a number of alcohol-\nrelated incidents.  In October 1976, he was arrested in State one for DuI and driving too\nfast for conditions (with injuries).  He was convicted of both of these offenses and\nsentenced to one year probation and fined $250.00 (see ex. F).  Applicant had\ncompleted football practice and had consumed alcohol after practice (R.T., at 54). \nWhile speeding he was struck by a couple who were hurt in the accident. The MP who\ncame to the scene smelled alcohol on Applicant and arrested him.  Applicant claims he\nhad only one eight ounce beer after the football game and was never administered a\nsobriety or breathalyzer test (R.T., at 54-57).  Collateral estoppel principles preclude\nhim, however, from factually challenging his court conviction for DuI in this security\nclearance proceeding.\nApplicant was arrested in September 1981 in State two and charged with (1)\nassault upon a military policeman (a violation of Art. 128 of the UCMJ), (2) resisting\napprehension (a violation of Art. 95 of the UCMJ), and (3) domestic disturbance.\nAccording to the arrest report, Applicant had been drinking prior to the incident (see ex.\nH).  He received a written reprimand from his command that doesn\u2019t mention any of the\nspecific charges or his use of alcohol as a contributing cause.  Applicant challenges the\narrest report\u2019s statements that he had been drinking, refused entry and resisted\napprehension (R.T., at 58-60).   He insists that he had just come from the gym and had\nnot consumed alcohol.  Without anymore information in the reprimand to corroborate\nApplicant\u2019s drinking prior to the incident, the report standing alone is insufficient to find\nalcohol to be a contributing factor to Applicant\u2019s actions in the incident.  Inferences\nwarrant, accordingly, that the 1981 domestic disturbance incident was not an alcohol-\nrelated one.   \nIn February 1989, Applicant was arrested and charged with DuI while driving in\nState three.  Applicant says he was en route to his training site and picked up a hitch-\nhiker along the way (R.T., at 60-61).  He later became sick (initially stating he may have\nbeen poisoned) and turned the driving duties over to the hitch-hiker.  He claims the\nhitch-hiker (not himself) was driving at the time his vehicle became inoperable (R.T., at\n61, 65).   When he returned to the vehicle following an unsuccessful attempt to secure a\ntow truck, he was transported by police to a local police station where he was charged\nwith DuI and leaving the scene (R.T., at 61-65).  He could not recall being administered\na breathalyzer test and vaguely remembers paying a $300.00 fine at the station for\nleaving the scene of an accident (R.T., at 64, 82). Applicant then was permitted to return\nto his duty station where he was briefly hospitalized.  He did not return to court on the\nappointed day of his trial to contest the charges; however, as a result of his failure to\nappear, he was tried in absentia and convicted of DuI (R.T., at 64-65).  Collateral\nestoppel principles preclude Applicant from challenging the court\u2019s DuI conviction in this\n\n4\nproceeding.  To date, he has not followed his attorney\u2019s advice to seek a reopening of\nthe proceedings to obtain an expungement of the DuI.  Inferences warrant that his\ncharged DuI offense in 1989 is an alcohol-related offense.\nApplicant was involved in another incident in May 1993.  He was arrested in\nState one and charged with DuI, speeding, improper lane usage, and safety belt\nviolation.  At the scene, he was administered a breathalyzer test, and he assures he\npassed the test (R.T., at 67).  But Applicant has been drinking earlier in the day at his\nbrother\u2019s house before returning to his duty station (R.T., at 66-67).   Having no idea\nwhy he was charged with DuI, he pled nolo contendere to the charges and was\nconvicted of the lesser offense of reckless driving.  On this conviction, the court\nsentenced him to 12 months of probation and fined him $1,150.00 (see ex. G).  The\ncommander\u2019s report makes no mention of alcohol and provides no reasons for his\nacceptance of a lesser plea.  Without more evidence of alcohol involvement in this\narrest, it may not be considered an alcohol-related offense.\nApplicant\u2019s last arrest for an alcohol-related offense occurred in May 2002 in\nState four.  Applicant had been drinking off and on during the day (more beer than\nusual) and was stopped by local police, who spotted him weaving in the roadway (R.T.,\nat 68).  Upon administering a breathalyzer and evaluating Applicant at the scene, police\narrested him and charged him with DuI (see ex. E; R.T., at 68).  As a result of his DuI\nconviction, the court sentenced him to 14 months of probation and fined him $500.00\nplus court costs (R.T., at 86).  He was instructed by the court to attend counseling.\nApplicant is credited with attending group counseling between July 2003 and\nMarch 2004 (ex. 5), which was comprised of  group sessions under the direction of a\nlicensed social worker (Mr. C).  During his counseling sessions, Mr. C emphasized the\nimportance of sobriety and encouraged AA participation for all of the group\u2019s members.\nApplicant attended a number of these sessions with Mr. C, who diagnosed him as\nalcohol dependent (see exs. D, 5 and 6).  However, Mr. C never shared his diagnosis\nwith Applicant (R.T., at 88-90).  Unaware that he had a drinking problem, let alone a\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence, Applicant  continued to drink after these sessions with\nMr. C and never attended AA meetings (R.T., at 71, 90).  He currently drinks beer from\ntime to time, but not every day or week (R.T., at 91).\nIn May 2007, Applicant twice consulted with Mr. B (also a licensed social worker).\nMr. B found no indicators of alcohol dependence in Applicant and made no\nrecommendation for alcohol treatment, sustained abstinence, or AA participation (ex. 5).\nWhen Applicant returned to the same clinic the following month on a walk-in basis he\nwas assigned to Dr. R (a licensed clinical psychologist).  While Applicant apparently did\nnot specifically request an evaluation, he referenced his prior sessions with Mr. B and\nhis continued drinking.  Applicant acknowledges Dr. R\u2019s recommending that he not drink\nanymore, but did not accept Dr. R\u2019s recommendation at the time (R.T., at 73-74). \nFollowing his session with Applicant, Dr. R retrieved the notes of Applicant\u2019s prior\nsessions with Mr. C.  Based on his verbal exchange with Applicant and his review of the\nlatter\u2019s case history, Dr. R diagnosed Applicant with an alcohol dependent diagnosis\n(see ex. 6).   In turn, Dr. R recommended Applicant quit drinking altogether and attend\nAA meetings regularly (see  ex. 7). \n\n5\nApplicant has a friend who socializes with him at family-oriented social\nexchanges.  This friend considers Applicant to be a moderate drinker (R.T., at 94-95).\nHe does not think he has an alcohol problem based on his experiences with him.   \nAsked to complete an SF-86 in February 2006, Applicant understated his\nalcohol-related offenses when responding to question 23 (see ex. A).  Question 23\nasked him to report all charges or convictions related to alcohol and drugs, unqualified\nby any time limitations.  He responded in the affirmative to the question, but listed only a\nMay 2001 DuI offense.  This offense corresponds to his admitted May 2002 arrest and\nconviction and for reporting purposes was treated as his 2002 offense.  However, he\nomitted his 1976, 1989 and 1993 DuI arrests.  He attributes his omissions to a mistaken\nunderstanding that the question asked for arrest information only for the previous seven\nyears (see response; R.T., at 76-80).\nIn the SF-86, Applicant completed in April 1992, the form asked for the disclosure\nof information to all of previous arrests (not just his alcohol-related ones).  In answering\nquestion 21 of the form.  When responding to question 21 of the questionnaire, which\nasked him to list all arrests (except for minor traffic violations, without any time\nlimitations, he reported only his 1989 DuI arrest, and omitted his 1976 and 1981 arrests.\nApplicant attributes these omissions, too, to his understanding at the time that the\nquestion only called for arrests within the previous seven years (R.T., at 83-84).\nBoth of the questionnaires at issue involve straight-forward questions about\nApplicant\u2019s arrest history without any time qualifiers.  The 1992 SF-86 is actually much\nbroader in its arrest coverage: It asks for \u201cAll arrest  information . . .\u201d and did not limit the\ninquiry to alcohol and drug-related arrests.  His 2006 application is more case specific: It\nlimits the inquiry to charges or convictions related to alcohol or drugs.  To misread\narrest history questions so completely in two separate applications places too much\nstrain on credibility limits. Acceptance of Applicant\u2019s explanations require more\ncorroborative proof of a good-faith misapprehension of the questions posed in each\nquestionnaire than Applicant was able to provide.  Candor lapses attributable to\nApplicant\u2019s concerns over the affects that derogatory information about his alcohol-\nrelated arrest history might have on his military career and security clearance are better\nexplanations of his omissions in both security clearance applications.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, common sense decision.\n\n6\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nAlcohol Consumption\n      \u201cThe Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, para. 21).\nPersonal Conduct\n    \u201cThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, para. 15).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge\ncannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\n       Applicant is an honorably discharged military veteran with a history of regular\nalcohol consumption over a 30-year period and three established alcohol-related\nincidents between 1976 and 2002.  Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents and\n\n7\ncontinued consumption in the face of diagnoses for alcohol dependence by certified\nclinicians, reflect both a recent pattern of alcohol abuse outside the work place and a\npotential dependency problem that raise security concerns.  Additional security\nconcerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s omissions of many of his alcohol-related and other\narrests in his answers to security clearance application in April 1992, and again in\nFebruary 2006 with respect to his omitted alcohol-related arrests.\nAlcohol issues\nOn the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions (DC)\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: 22(a) (\u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d), 22(c)\n(\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d),\n22(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d); and (e)\n(\u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker\nwho is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d).\nApplicant\u2019s diagnosed alcohol dependence reflects habitual drinking at various\ntimes over a 30-year period.  Even though he has denied having a drinking problem, he\nhas not furnished any documentation of his own from a clinician or licensed substance\nabuse counselor that challenges the dependence evaluations of Mr. C and Dr. R.  The\ncombination of his years of abusive drinking that manifested in a series of alcohol-\nrelated offenses (three proven ones altogether) and dependence diagnoses by certified\nhealth clinicians experienced in substance abuse issues justify assigning some\napplication to DC 22(c) of the guidelines for alcohol consumption as well.\nBecause Applicant has not acknowledged an alcohol problem, he has continued\nto drink and avoid his recommended AA attendance.  His failure to challenge the\ndisputed diagnoses from the certified clinicians who evaluated him and/or enlist\nsubstance abuse counseling and a favorable prognosis for any identified alcohol\nproblem to date, preclude application of any of the mitigating conditions of the\nguidelines for alcohol consumption.   Favorable views from his social friend about his\nimpressions of Applicant\u2019s drinking pattern, while helpful, are not enough to mitigate\nalcohol concerns under any of the covered mitigating conditions.\nWhole person assessment does not alter risk concerns associated with\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol-related offenses and current drinking patterns in the\naftermath of his alcohol dependence assessments by certified clinicians and applicant\u2019s\ncorresponding failure to either mount a successful challenge of these diagnoses or give\nup drinking and turn to AA for support in maintaining his sobriety.  Applicant has a long\nhistory of recurrent alcohol abuse that are reflected in both alcohol-related incidents\nover a 25-year period and his more recent diagnoses of alcohol dependence.  With his\ndenials of a dependence problem and continued drinking, he fails to demonstrate any\nsustained commitment to address his established alcohol problem. \n\n8\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant failed to make a convincing\nshowing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any\nrecurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  There is insufficient\nevidence to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk of judgment impairment\nassociated with such alcohol-related conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c and 1.e through 1.h of the SOR.   Subparagraphs 1.b\nand 1.d are favorably concluded. \nE-qip and SF-86 omissions\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list all of his arrests in his1992 SF-86 and all of his alcohol-related\narrests in his more recent 2006 e-qip.   So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to\nsee classified information that the margins for excusing candor lapses are necessarily\nnarrow.\nBy omitting his 1976 and 1981 arrests in his 1992 SF-86 and his 1976 and 1989\nDuI arrests in his more recent 2006 e-qip, Applicant concealed materially important\nbackground information needed for the government to properly process and evaluate\nhis security updates.  His claims of misunderstanding the scope of the arrest-related\nquestions lack substantiation.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his SF-\n86/e-qip omissions, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the necessary probative showing to avert\ndrawn conclusions he deliberately withheld material background information about the\nextent of his arrest history.\nApplicant\u2019s claims of misunderstanding the scope of the pertinent questions in his\nrespective applications are not convincing.  The questions involved in each application\ncontain no time qualifications and could not plausibly be so misread on two separate\noccasions.  Applicant\u2019s omissions require application of a disqualifying condition (DC)\nfor personal conduct of the Guidelines: 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d).\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, because his omissions are neither\nisolated nor followed by prompt and good faith corrections of his omissions.  Under\nthese circumstances, he cannot claim the benefit of any of the potentially applicable\nmitigating conditions.  Not only has the Appeal Board found the use of the predecessor\nto mitigating condition (MC) 17(c) (which is A5.1.3.2) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for\npersonal conduct (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as\nisolated, but it has denied applicants availability of MC 17(a) and its predecessor\nmitigating condition (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d).  Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289\n(January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January1995).\n\n9\n \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to sub-paras. 2.a and 2.b of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\n        In light  of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

On June 27, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 28, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey-\nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because Applicant has\npaid off or otherwise resolved most of the debts alleged in the SOR, and there is a \u201creasonable\npossibility\u201d that Applicant\u2019s remaining unpaid debts were incurred by his deceased wife from whom\nhe was separated.  He further argues that he acted reasonably in waiting to pay off those remaining\ndebts until such time as they can be verified.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, there\nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See, e.g.,  ISCR\nCase No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although the Applicant strongly disagrees\nwith the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision he still had significant outstanding debts\nand was still in the process of trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent and still ongoing.\nThe favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App.\nBd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the\nBoard concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation\n\nfor her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

On June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 3, 3007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on October 11, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 29, 2008,\nand the hearing was scheduled for February 29, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\nsubmitted presented eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8.\nThe Applicant presented twelve exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through L,\nand testified on his own behalf.  Applicant submitted his First Amended Response to the\n\n2\nSOR that was admitted into evidence without objection.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nThe official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 19, 2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 53 years old and is currently married to\na Thai national.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Chief Steward and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant explained that he and his first wife were both merchant mariners\nand jointly earned approximately $140,000.00 annually.  (Tr. p. 64).  They paid their bills\non time and their credit was excellent.  In mid-summer 2000, the Applicant\u2019s wife was\ndiagnosed with lung cancer and was unable to work from that point on.  The Applicant\nbecame the sole supporter of the household.  The Applicant\u2019s indebtedness became\noverwhelming and they subsequently lost everything.  He tried to work with their\ncreditors but was offered no relief.  \nDue to her illness, related depression and marital discord, the Applicant and his\nwife separated in June 2001.  He last communicated with her in May or June 2002.  In\nDecember 2004, the Applicant\u2019s wife died.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).  It was not until\nMarch 2005, that the Applicant learned of his wife\u2019s death from a union officer, since\nthey were both members of the same maritime union, and there were questions\nregarding whether the Applicant\u2019s signature had been forged on some particular\ndocument.     \nThe SOR alleges eighteen delinquent creditors that total indebtedness in excess\nof $70,000.00.  In his First Amended Response to the SOR, the Applicant admits in part\nand denies in part the delinquent debts set forth in allegations 1(a), 1(d), 1(e), 1(g), 1(k),\n1(m), 1(n), 1(o), 1(p), 1(q) and 1(r) of the SOR.  He admits that the debts were at one\ntime owing, that they were his wife\u2019s debts, and that his wife discharged the debts on\nMarch 17, 2003, by way of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  Credit\nreports of the Applicant dated June 12, 2006; December 5, 2006; and October 11, 2007,\nreflect each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3\nand 8).  \n\n3\nIn his First Amended Response to the SOR, he admits, without reservation, that\nthe delinquent debts set forth in allegations 1(b), 1(g), 1(h), and 1(k) are his debts.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  The Applicant admits the debts owed to Asset Acceptance in the\namount of $ 4,119.00, which he claims may be the same debt as Providian, but he is\nnot sure; Macy\u2019s in the amount of $574; a debt owed to MCDF/CBSD in the amount of\n$3,410.00; and a debt owed to GEMB/J.C. Penneys in the amount of $852.00.  They\ntotal in excess of $8,0000.00.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing varied dramatically from his written\nresponse to the SOR.  The Applicant testified equivocally with regard to many of the\ndebts stating that he is not sure whether they are his debts or his wife\u2019s debts.  He avers\nthat the debt to Asset Acceptance in the amount of $4,119.00 could be his wife\u2019s.  (Tr.\np. 51).  He does not know if the debt to Macy\u2019s in the amount of $574.00 is his debt or\nnot, but that he did have a Macy\u2019s credit card.  (Tr. p. 53).  The J.C Penney debt in the\namount of $852.00 may also be his debt, but he is not sure.  The debt to Greentree\nFinancial Corp. in the amount of $7,718.00 was a debt on the family residence, although\nhe thought it was paid.  He is not sure whether the debt in the amount of $359.00 owed\nto JJ MacIntyr is his or his wife\u2019s.  (Tr. 54).  He does not recall the debt to MCDF/CBSD\nin the amount of $3,410.00 or the debt to NCO Financial in the amount of $1,624.00.\nHe does not know whether the debt to MBNA in the amount of $4,031.00 is his, his\nwife\u2019s, or is a joint debt.  (Tr. p. 58).   \nThe Applicant avered with more certainty that the following debts are not his\ndebts, but are his wife\u2019s debts, since he did not have these accounts; four American\nExpress Accounts in the total amount of $28,207.00; a debt to Discover card in the\namount of $10,839.00; a debt to Exxon Mobil in the amount of $269.00; and a debt to\nPortfolio RC in the amount of $269.00 (Tr. p. 57).\nIn May 2007, over a year ago, realizing that his finances were in disarray, the\nApplicant hired a law firm to help him with his delinquent debt.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nK).  He indicates that their job was to verify the debts listed on his credit report.  Once\nthe debts were verified and determined to be his, he would pay them.  The Applicant\nhas not received any verification as of yet.  (Tr. p. 67).\nThe Applicant states that he has recently paid off a debt to Westridge Financial in\nthe amount of $414.00, (Tr. p. 59); a debt to Credit Bur Cen in the amount of $519.00,\neven though he admits that it was his wife\u2019s debt (Tr. p. 52); and a debt to Providian\nBank in the amount of $3,456.00  (Tr. p. 58).  He presented no documentation to\nsubstantiate these payments.  \nA copy of a credit card debit on January 16, 2008, shows that a payment of\n$2,500.00 was made to Nelson Watson Pinnacle, which the Applicant believes might be\nrepresenting Midland credit management.  The Applicant states that this payment\nsettled the debt.  (See, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  There was also some testimony that the\ndebt to MCDF/CBSD may be the same as the Midland credit management debt, but the\nApplicant presented no documentary evidence to substantiate this.     \n\n4\nRecently, the Applicant learned that his wife, prior to her death, filed Chapter 7\nBankruptcy, and her debts from the marriage were discharged on March 17, 2003.  The\nApplicant submitted a copy of the Bankruptcy matrix to prove that the debts listed in the \nSOR were discharged.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  The Applicant was not named as a\npetitioner in her Bankruptcy and has not filed Bankruptcy on his own behalf.  (Tr. p. 66). \nAlthough the credit reports presented by the Government reflect each of the\ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR, these credit reports pre-date the credit report offered\nby the Applicant.  The Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report dated January 28, 2008,\nfrom one of the reporting agencies reflects four of the delinquent debts set forth in the\nSOR.  A debt to Asset Acceptance in the amount of $4,273.00; a debt to Midland Credit\nin the amount of $6,704.00; a debt to Verizon in the amount of $1,727.00; and a debt to\nMacy\u2019s in the amount of $573.00.  At least three of the four debts remain delinquent and\nowing and total in excess of $6,000.00.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L).  When asked what\nhis intention is concerning his delinquent debts, the Applicant stated, \n \u201cI will pay them, or I will enter into an agreement.  I am --I am trying to\nrebuild a life, that\u2019s all.  I can\u2019t do it all -- I couldn\u2019t do it all at once.  Now, if\nthis is presented to me in a format that I can deal with, that\u2019s what I have\nbeen trying to do to the best of my ability.  I will pay any debt that is\nbrought to me that is valid.\u201d  (Tr. p. 118).  \nThe Applicant has recently tried to make contact with some of these creditors.\nThe Applicant through his present attorney, recently sent a letter to one of the credit\nagency\u2019s disputing his debt to Verizon in the amount of $1,700.00. (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B).  Applicant believes that because he only had the phone two days before\ngoing out to sea and had no service while out to sea, his bill should not be $1,700.00.\nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant reflect \u201cexcellent ratings\u201d on the job for\nthe periods January 2006 through April 2006, May 2007 through July 2007 and\nDecember 2007 through February 2008.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor, the project manager,\nand the facility security officer of the vessel, collectively indicate that the Applicant is a\ntrue professional, with outstanding work performance.  His work ethic, maturity and\npositive attitude make him a valuable asset.  He has been responsible for a large\nconsumable budget, direct interaction with vendors, produce usage and handling which\nall have direct impact on overall project budget and expenditures.  He is highly\nmotivated, and a team member with the highest level of integrity and ability.  He is\nhighly recommended for a position of trust.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).   \n\n5\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \n\n6\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n7\nThe evidence shows that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control initially\ncaused his financial hardships.  Namely, when he became the sole supporter of the\nhousehold, following his wife\u2019s lung cancer diagnosis, their separation, and her eventual\ndeath.  The question now is whether he has acted responsibly since then.  He has not.  \nBefore her death, the Applicant\u2019s wife filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and discharged\nher debts.  Any joint debts incurred during the marriage would continue to be the\nApplicant\u2019s legal and moral responsibility to pay.  On the one hand, the Applicant is\nuncertain about many of the debts listed in the SOR, and contends that he does not\nknow whether they are his or his wife\u2019s  debts.  On the other hand, he asserts that they\nwere his wife\u2019s debts and he mistakenly relies on the Bankruptcy matrix to show that the\ndebts were discharged.  The Bankruptcy matrix lists a number of the creditors including\nmany of the debts listed in the SOR.  However, the matrix simply verifies that those\ncreditors listed were provided notice of the bankruptcy and that the debts may have\nbeen discharged.  It does not in any way prove that the debts are no longer owed by the\nApplicant.  Despite this, giving the Applicant the benefit of the doubt, I find for the\nApplicant regarding the delinquent debts set forth in allegations 1(a), 1(c), 1(d), 1(f), 1(i),\n1(j), 1(l), 1(m), 1(n), and 1(o).     \nBased upon the evidence, the Applicant clearly owes the delinquent debts listed\nin the SOR set forth in allegations 1(b), 1(g), 1(h), and 1(k), and he is disputing the\namount of the debt owed in 1(q).  As to the delinquent debts, set forth in allegations\n1(e), 1(p), and 1(r), the evidence is mixed.  He contends that he has paid them, but has\nsubmitted no documentary evidence to substantiate the payoffs.  It is his burden to\nshow me that he no longer owes these debts, and he has not done it.  The Applicant\nhas had sufficient time since his wife\u2019s death in December 2004, to get his finances in\norder and resolve his indebtedness.  He has failed to do so.      \nThe Applicant\u2019s finances are still in disarray.  Despite the fact that in March 2007,\nhe hired a law firm to assist him in determining which debts were his, the evidence\nshows that very little, if anything, has been resolved since then.  I have considered the\nfact that his present attorney has recently sent letters to the credit agencies concerning\nhis debts.  However, at the present time, he does not know what he owes.              \nUpon review of his financial report, it appears that he has some disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his delinquent bills, but he has not used it in any\nsignificant way to resolve his indebtedness.  His most recent payment made was by\ndebit card.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions\n19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations are applicable.  None of the mitigating factors apply.  His financial\nproblems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a\nprompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  I have considered among other things, his\nfavorable performance evaluations and letters of recommendation.  However, under the\n\n8\nparticular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of questionable\njudgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.  The Applicant remains excessively indebted.\nHe has only begun the process of financial rehabilitation, and he has a long way to go\nbefore his financial affairs are in order.      \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He was indebted to the Internal\nRevenue Service in the amount of $3,368 for tax period 1990. For tax period 1987, 1988 and 1989\nhe owed approximately $15,181. The tax liens from 1994 have been released. Applicant attempted\nto pay them recently, but the IRS will not accept any payment. Applicant has mitigated security\nconcerns arising under financial considerations. Clearance is granted. \n\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated June 4, 2007.\n1\n Government Ex. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated February 13, 2006).\n2\nId.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 13, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On May 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on June 4, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on June 27, 2007. After agreement with both counsel, I scheduled a hearing for\nAugust 22, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 22, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-4) were admitted without objection. Applicant did not submit any\nexhibits at the hearing. Applicant testified in his own behalf, as reflected in the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) received on August 29, 2007. I left the record open so that Applicant could supplement the\nrecord. He timely submitted a document marked as AE A. Department Counsel had no objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR \u00b6 1.a  and 1.b  are incorporated herein.1\nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 58-year-old working for a defense contractor. He graduated from high school\nin 1967. He is twice divorced and has four grown children.  Applicant has been employed with his\n2\ncurrent employer since 2005.3\nApplicant had a successful business from 1980 until 1985. In 1985, his brother-in-law bought\ninto the business encouraged by Applicant's father. His sister agreed to take care of the financial\nbooks. In 1985, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) visited Applicant's place of business and closed\n\nTr. 16; GE 3 (Financial Interrogatories).\n4\nTr. 17.\n5\nTr. 18-19.\n6\nTr. 26.\n7\nGE 2 (Credit Bureau Report),\n8\nGE 3 supra note 4.\n9\n4\nit. Applicant learned that his sister and brother-in-law had not paid the taxes to the IRS. The amount\ndue to the government was $108,000. Applicant paid the entire amount to the IRS.4\nAfter the business closed, Applicant found it difficult to find employment. He had been in\nthe automotive repair business, but wanted to return to work in the electronics field. At the same\ntime, his first marriage failed. He lost his home and a great deal of income. He was on\nunemployment for a period of time. Eventually he found employment but at a reduced pay of $9 an\nhour.5\nWhen Applicant remarried in 1983, he had some problems with his new wife's ex-husband.\nA law matter was filed against Applicant for reasons that are not relevant to this case. Despite the\nfact that the matters were dropped, he lost his job. He and his wife had to move in with his parents\nfor two years due to financial problems. He had many legal fees to pay.  During this time, Applicant\ncould not pay his federal tax for tax periods ending 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990.Applicant found\nsteady employment but was laid off in 1997.6\nAfter that, he could only find employment at reduced pay rates. He paid many fees to lawyers\nat the time. Instead of paying his taxes, he paid his lawyers. He had no money and thus did not pay\nthe taxes. There is no evidence in the record that he did not file at that time, although he does not\nremember.  \n7\nA federal tax lien was filed on August 1994 in the amount of $3,368 for non-payment of  a\ndelinquent tax for tax period ending December 31, 1990. On January 15, 1993, a federal tax lien was\nfiled for non-payment of delinquent tax debt in the amount of $15,181 for tax periods ending\nDecember 1987, 1988 and 1999.8\nHe now takes care of his elderly parents. He provides for his family. He sent his children to\ncollege. He bought his wife a car. His credit is fine now. He has no delinquent debts. He is current\nwith his home mortgage.9\nApplicant hired a law firm to help him sort out the tax liens with the IRS. He did not have\nany property for so long and did not have any money that he put the taxes in the background. He\ncontacted the law firm to see if he could make a settlement offer. The law firm provided some\n\nTr. 23.\n10\nAE A and B (Certificate).\n11\nGovernment Ex. 2 (Credit Bureau Report, dated March 10, 2006).\n12\nAE C (Performance Evaluation).\n13\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd.

He inquired about the liens and wanted to make\npayment. He was told that the liens had been released. Prior to his visit, he did not know that the\nliens will expire normally after a period of time. He went to the courthouse to obtain documentation.\nThey did not have anything to give him. The IRS will not accept any money from Applicant at this\ntime because the liens have expired.11\nApplicant earns approximately $4,444 net a month.  After his expenses, he has a net\n12\nremainder of $1,512. He has a very good credit rating. He has no adverse account information. He\nis in a good position at this time and is financially stable.\nApplicant has worked his entire life and takes pride in his achievements. He had some\ndifficult circumstances regarding his loss of employment and failed business but he continued to\nlive his life and provide for his family. He received an excellent performance evaluation in his\ncurrent employment.  \n13\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the\nconduct, (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for\nor against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n14\n\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Department of the Navy v.

The burden of proof is something less than a\n15\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n16\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n17\ndecision.18\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n19\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n20\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n21\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n22\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.23\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant had two tax liens\nfrom 1993 and 1994.  Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC), AG\n\u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) apply. \n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \"good faith\" effort to repay overdue creditors\n24\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts. The Directive does not define the term \n\"good-faith.\" However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that\na person acts in such a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.' Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\n7\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. Several incidents occurred\nin Applicant's life over which he had little or no control. His failed business, separation and divorce,\ncombined with his loss of employment in 1997, lower paying jobs for a period of years and legal fees\nsubstantially contributed to his inability to pay his taxes. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. \nThe tax liens are the result of not paying taxes from 1987 through 1990. Applicant did not\nhave the money to pay at that time. He perhaps made an error and paid other bills and legal fees\nrather than the taxes. He now understands the severe consequence of not paying taxes. He is now in\na position to continue in employment with no delinquent debts. Therefore, Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC), \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.\nApplicant did not receive financial counseling, but he hired lawyers to assist him with his tax\nliens. However, the tax liens are released. He has no other financial difficulties. The tax issue is\nresolved. FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does apply\nto some extent.\nIn the past years, Applicant did not have sufficient income to pay the tax liens. He paid his\ninitial debt to the IRS and paid all legal fees that he incurred for some incidents that were beyond his\ncontrol. He went to the IRS office to pay his tax liens recently and learned that they were released\ndue to age. He stood ready to pay them. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to a degree.24\nWhole Person Analysis\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, mature man who was recounted his negative experiences and how he persevered. His\ntestimony at the hearing was candid and straightforward. At the hearing he acknowledged the\nfinancial delinquencies would be considered a negative. He is open, honest and has not hidden the\n\n8\nsituation. He believed his choice to pay legal fees and other debts was the reasonable action at the\ntime. He has not incurred any delinquent debt in two years. His financial circumstances have\nimproved. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low. He is current on his\nfinancial obligations, and has a very positive employment history. A greater awareness of financial\nresponsibilities will result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low.

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant has owed approximately $10,000.00 in past due debts to seven creditors since\nat least 2000.  He does not have the ability to pay off or otherwise resolve these debts.  He is not\ncurrently eligible for security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 21, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on August 6, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued\non August 7, 2007.\nA hearing was held on September 5, 2007, at which the Government presented six\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted two hearing\nexhibits and one post-hearing exhibit.  The transcript was received on September 14, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43, married to his second wife and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He\nis employed by a defense contractor as an engineer, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial considerations).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that\nthe Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admitted in his answer all of the\nallegations in the SOR with the exception of subparagraph 1.l.  Those admissions are hereby deemed\nfindings of fact.\nThe Applicant has been married twice.  His first marriage ended in divorce in 2000.  He\nalleges that many of his financial problems occurred as a result of the divorce.  (Transcript at 20.)\nWhile he was still married to his first wife, the Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the\nBankruptcy Code.  (SOR subparagraph 1.m.)  He received a discharge in bankruptcy in August 1999.\n(Transcript at 41-42.)  (SOR subparagraph 1.n.)\nAfter he was divorced, the Applicant filed for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy\nCode in May 2001.  (SOR subparagraph 1.k.)  The Applicant did not want to proceed with the\nbankruptcy, and his case was dismissed.  (Transcript at 42-43.)  (SOR subparagraph 1.l.)\n\n3\n  The current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows:\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a past due medical bill for $50.00.  The available\ncredit reports do not provide contact information for the creditor and the Applicant has not been able\nto find such information.  This debt remains unpaid.  (Transcript at 24-26, 53-55; Government\nExhibits 2 and 3.)\n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a past due debt to a bank in the approximate\namount of $3,576.00.  This debt has not been paid.  The available evidence indicates that the original\ncreditor has sold this debt.  The Applicant states that he is in negotiation to pay this debt, but he has\npresented no evidence to support this statement.  (Transcript at 26-27, 61-63; Government Exhibits\n2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 at 7; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 5.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a past due debt to his ex-wife\u2019s lawyer in the\namount of $5,692.19.  The Applicant made a payment arrangement with the attorney on September\n4, 2007, agreeing to pay $250.00 a month until the debt is paid off.  He has made one payment.\n(Transcript at 27-28, 66; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a past due debt to McDonnell Douglas Federal\nCredit Union in the amount of $166.00.  This debt has not been paid.  According to the Applicant,\nthis credit union went out of existence at the same time McDonnell Douglas was bought by Boeing.\nHe has been in contact with the successor in interest to the credit union, but has been unable to either\nconfirm or deny that there is an amount now owing.  (Transcript at 28-30.)\n1.e.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a past due credit card debt to Providian in the\namount of $835.00.  This debt has not been paid.  The Applicant states that this debt was run up by\nhis ex-wife without his knowledge.  The debt has been charged off and the successor in interest to\nProvidian will not accept payments on the account.  (Transcript at 30-31, 45.)\n1.f.\nThe Applicant admits he owes a past due utility bill in the amount of $530.00.  The\nApplicant testified that this debt was paid by his ex wife.  (Transcript at 32-33.)  The Applicant\nsubmitted a copy of his latest utility bill from the same company.  It shows a past due amount of\n$222.63 as of August 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 4.)\n1.g.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a past due credit card debt to Nuvision in the\namount of $102.00.  This debt has not been paid.  The evidence concerning this allegation is mixed.\nThe Applicant stated that he is in negotiation with his ex wife to have her pay this debt.  (Transcript\nat 33-34.)  He also stated in April 2007 that he had been in negotiations with this creditor himself.\n(Transcript at 78-79; Government Exhibit 6 at 7.)\n1.h.\nThis debt has been paid in full.  (Transcript at 35-38; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 3.)\nThis debt was paid off by the Applicant\u2019s wife refinancing her house and paying off the debt in the\namount of $5,375.00.\n1.i.\nThe state tax lien has been paid off and lifted.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 7-9.)\n\n4\n1.j.\nThe Applicant admits owing $4,442.35 in past due homeowners association dues.\nThe debt has been paid.  (Transcript at 41.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\n\n5\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of financial irresponsibility that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has long-standing and continuing financial problems (Guideline F).  \nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him, except\nin part.  Under Paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1.h., 1.i., and 1.j. are found for the Applicant as he has\nsuccessfully paid these debts in full.\nThe Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are of a long-standing nature.  Even though they may\nhave originally been caused by the aftermath of his divorce, he has presented insufficient evidence\nthat he will be able to resolve his debts any time in the foreseeable future.  Rather, the Applicant asks\nthe Government to trust him when he states that he will pay his debts eventually.  In fact, he had no\nanswer when asked why he had not resolved these debts earlier.  (Transcript at 62-63.)  He also has\nno specific plan as to how he intended to pay off the rest of his past due debts.  (Transcript at 80-82.)\nUnder Guideline F, the following Disqualifying Conditions are applicable: 19(a) \u201cInability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and 19(c) \u201cA history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  None\n\n6\nof the Mitigating Conditions apply.  The behavior is recent, he is not receiving counseling for the\nproblem and he has not yet initiated a good faith effort to repay the creditors or resolve the debts.\nI have considered the fact that the Applicant may have had financial problems during the pendency\nof his divorce, during which many of the debts were incurred.  Specifically, I have considered the\nApplicant\u2019s arguments and evidence concerning subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.\nHowever, under the particular facts of this case, the evidence does not show that the Applicant acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances during that period, or afterwards.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's\ninformation opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a\nfinding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 21, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 2,\n2006. On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J, G,\nH, and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 10, 2007.  He\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn October 11, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on November 10, 2007.\n\n2\nApplicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on February 5, 2007.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Items 1-10).\nNo documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR (Item 4) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under\nGuidelines J, G, and H, and he denied 4.a., under Guideline E. The admitted allegations\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 59 years old. He works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe SOR lists 7 allegations, 1.a. through 1.g., regarding criminal conduct under\nAdjudicative Guideline J. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. On June 25, 2000, Applicant was arrested for Possession of a Controlled\nSubstance, crack cocaine, and Appearing in Public in an Intoxicated Condition.\nApplicant was granted First Offender Status, but on April 2, 2002, his First Offender\nStatus was revoked and he was found guilty of Violating the Drug Control Act, which is\na felony. He was sentenced to five years incarceration with five years suspended,\nconditioned upon good behavior and supervised probation. His driver\u2019s licence was also\nsuspended for 6 months. \n1.b. On November 6, 2000, Applicant was arrested for Contempt of Court for\nfailing to appear in court on October 24, 2000. Applicant was found not guilty, and the\ncharge was dismissed.\n \n1.c.  On May 1, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a\nControlled Substance Violating the Drug Control Act, a felony, Driving Under the\nInfluence-2nd offense, and Driving After Forfeiture of License. Applicant  was sentenced\nto five years incarceration with five years suspended, conditioned upon good behavior\nand supervised probation, which was also part of the sentence under 1.a., above. \n \n\n3\n1.d. On April 6, 2003, Applicant was charged with Driving After License Revoked.\nOn July 28, 2003, he was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of $100 and court costs\nof $74. \n1.e.  It is alleged in the SOR that on April 17, 2003, Applicant was charged with\nPossession of Alcohol in a Park. The evidence indicates that this incident actually\noccurred on May 13, 2005 (Item 7). Applicant was ordered to pay a fine and court costs\nof $91. \n1.f.  On January 28, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving with\na Restricted License/DUI Related. He was found guilty and sentenced to serve 12\nmonths in jail, with 9 months suspended. Applicant was also ordered to pay a fine of\n$300 and court costs of $161. \n1.g.  It is also alleged in the SOR that on January 28, 2006, Applicant was again\ncharged with Possession of Alcohol in a Park. The evidence indicates that this incident\nactually occurred on February 13, 2006 (Item 7). Applicant was ordered to pay a fine\nand court costs of $91. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.  \n2.a. Applicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.c., is included in\nthis paragraph under alcohol consumption. \n2.b.  Applicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.e., is included\nin this paragraph under alcohol consumption. \n2.c.  Applicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.g., is included\nin this paragraph under alcohol consumption. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has abused illegal substances. \n3.a. Applicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.a., is included\nin this paragraph under drug involvement.\n3.b. Applicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.c., is included in\nthis paragraph under drug involvement.\n\n4\nParagraph 4 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because when Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance\nApplication (SCA) on March 2, 2006 (Item 5), he furnished untruthful information to the\nGovernment. \n4.a. Applicant answered a series of questions under Section 23, regarding his\npolice record. Applicant failed to identify his conviction on April 2, 2002, of Violating the\nDrug Control Act, as alleged in 1.a., and the charges for Possession of Alcohol on April\n17, 2003, and January 28, 2006, as alleged in 1.e. and 1.g., above.  \nWhile it is not alleged in the SOR, I note Applicant also failed to identify his\nJanuary 28, 2006 arrest and charge of Driving with a Restricted License/DUI Related,\nfor which he was found guilty and sentenced to serve 12 months in jail, with 9 months\nsuspended, as alleged in 1.f., above. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct, as he was arrested for, and convicted of criminal offenses from\n2000 to 2006, related to illegal alcohol and drug usage and to operating a vehicle after\nforfeiture of his license. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions (MC), I can not find that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is no\nevidence of successful rehabilitation because the last criminal conduct occurred in\n2006, only two years ago, and I have seen no evidence of sincere remorse.  Applicant\nhas not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in four alcohol related incidents,\noccurring in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2006.\nThe Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was\ninvolved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, and binge alcohol consumption to\nthe point of impaired judgement, specifically  DUIs in 2001 and 2003, and possession of\nAlcohol in a Park in 2005 and 2006. DC 22. (a) and 22 (c) apply to this case.  \nIn his response to interrogatories (Item 6), Applicant admitted to currently\ndrinking \u201cabout a 6 pack [of beer] between Saturday and Sunday\u201d but he indicated that\nhe did not intend to drink alcoholic beverages in the future. Since no independent\nevidence was introduced as to Applicant\u2019s past or current alcohol consumption, I can\nnot find that any MC applies under Guideline G.  Paragraph 2 is found against\nApplicant.        \n\n6\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant\nhas been convicted on two occasions of possessing illegal drugs in 2000 and 2001,\nboth felonies. While Applicant denied ever using drugs in his response to interrogatories\n(Item 6), he was found guilty on both of these possession charges, including the\nincident in 2001 for which Applicant pled guilty. Based on these two convictions, I can\nnot find credible Applicant's denial of drug usage. Pursuant to Applicant\u2019s SCA (Item 5),\nhe has possessed a security clearance since 1982, and his drug convictions occurred\nafter he was granted a security clearance. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his\nillegal substance abuse falls within Drug Involvement DC 25. (a) (any drug abuse), (c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,\nor distribution), and (g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance).\nAfter considering the lack of any independent evidence as to Applicant\u2019s past or\ncurrent drug usage, together with Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility, I can not conclude that\nany MC applies under this Guideline.\nAccordingly, Paragraph 3 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government untruthful, incomplete information, regarding his arrests for drug and\nalcohol usage in a SCA, executed on March 2, 2006.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an\nindividual given a clearance. In this case, based on Applicant\u2019s overall history of criminal\nconduct, my inability to see the Applicant and judge his veracity in person, and the lack\nof any witness to provide testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s character, I can find no\nreasonable explanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to provide this very significant information\nto the Government on the SCA, and I must conclude that Applicant knowingly and\nwillingly failed to give complete, honest information to the Government. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nDC16. (a) applies because Applicant deliberately provided false and misleading\ninformation to the Government in a SCA.   No Mitigating Condition applies under this\nGuideline.  As a result of the misinformation that Applicant  provided to the Government,\nhis conduct exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I\nresolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the\nGovernment's evidence opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the\n\n7\nevidence supports a finding against Applicant as to the allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 through 4 of the Government's SOR. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines J, G, H, and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this\ncase. Based on all of the reasons cited above, including the questionable credibility of\nApplicant and the lack of any independent evidence on his behalf, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst  Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On October\n29, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications were deliberate.\nApplicant argues that she did not deliberately falsify her security clearance application,\nexecuted on July 18, 2006, by failing to disclose an alcohol-related arrest which had occurred in\nMarch 2006.  In support of that argument, Applicant contends that she failed to disclose the\ninformation because she misunderstood the question.  She also argues that she did not deliberately\nmake a false statement to a government investigator in her November 1, 2006 interview, when she\nexplained that she had omitted the charge from her July 8, 2006 application because the final\ndisposition of the charge had occurred at a later date.  The charge had in fact been adjudicated and\ndisposed of on June 27, 2006.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanations as to why she failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanations.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanations in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  On this record, the\nJudge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.

In 2006, she \nfailed to disclose an arrest for underage possession of alcohol as required on her Security \nClearance Application. She subsequently provided a false explanation for failing to disclose this \narrest. Security concerns pertaining to drug involvement are mitigated; however, security concerns \nrelating to personal conduct are not mitigated. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n1\n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn July 18, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On \nMay 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her,2 under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \ndated June 30, 2007, was provided to her on July 15, 2007, and she was afforded an opportunity \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.5 Submissions \nwere due by August 10, 2007.6 On August 13, 2007, Applicant responded to the FORM and \nprovided additional documents. On August 22, 2007, Department Counsel declined to object to \nApplicant\u2019s additional documents. The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2007.  I \nadmitted the documents she submitted in response to the FORM. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the \nallegation that she deliberately falsified her SF 86 with intent to deceive. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact.

Since May 2006, she has had an intern job with a government contractor. She is \na diligent worker. She loves and respects her parents, and her country. She has learned from her \nmistakes and will not repeat them. She is loyal to her country and is a good American citizen. \nShe provided strong letters of recommendation from her mother, employer, pastor, coach at her \nuniversity, and assistant dean of students. They laud her hard work, dependability, integrity, \nleadership and positive personality.  She has been active in her church and school, and has a 3.68 \nGPA in college.  \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nFrom 2003 to August 2006, Applicant used marijuana about seven times.9  She used \nmarijuana when she was consuming alcohol. Her most recent marijuana use was in August 2006, \nafter signing her SF 86.  \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant indicated she did not intend to use marijuana or other illegal \nsubstances in the future. She emphasized she has limited contact with her marijuana-using \nfriends because they moved off campus, and she has remained on campus. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nOn January 30, 2005, Applicant received a ticket for driving 108 miles per hour (mph) in \na 65 mph zone and reckless driving.10 On February 22, 2005, she was found guilty of speeding, \nand her reckless driving charge was dismissed. She was sentenced to a fine and ordered to pay \ncourt costs, totaling $539.  Her driver\u2019s license was suspended for two months.  \n \nOn March 3, 2006, Applicant was at an off campus party when the police entered the \nresidence and noted alcohol was present. She received a summons and was charged with  \nunderage possession of alcohol. On June 27, 2006, she was found not guilty of this offense.11  \nSection 23 of Applicant\u2019s July 18, 2006, SF 86 asks, \u201cSection 23: Your Police Record . . . d.  \nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or \ndrugs?\u201d to which Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d   \n \nOn November 1, 2006, Applicant told a Department of Defense (DoD) investigator that \nshe did not disclose the underage possession of alcohol incident because the final disposition of \nthis charge occurred after she completed her SF 86.12 The DoD investigative interview states, \n \n7Item 3, supra n. 1.   \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n9 Item 4, Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories, dated March 2, 2007, is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, unless stated otherwise.  \n \n10 Item 2, supra n. 4, is the source for the facts in this section, unless stated otherwise. \n \n11 Item 4 (Automated Complaint System, Charge Disposition Inquiry, March 6, 2007). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\n\u201cAfter discussing it with her mother, they did not think it was necessary to list something where \nthe outcome was not known.\u201d As indicated previously, the underage possession of alcohol \noffense was dismissed on June 27, 2006, and she signed her SF 86 on July 18, 2006. \n   \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant explained why she answered, \u201cNo\u201d for SF 86, \nSection 23d: \n \nI didn\u2019t particularly understand \u201ccharged or convicted\u201d because nothing was held \nagainst me. The court told me this would not be on my records and would not be \nneeded for my clearance. I did not deliberately withhold this information on \npurpose. I was told it was not needed because it was not on my record. Also, I \ntold the judge I would be going through a security clearance, and how does this \nshow up on my record? He said quote, \u201cBeing cleared shows up as nothing \u2013 it \nnever happened.\u201d So I listened to the judge and never brought it up! \n \nThe FORM lists her inconsistent explanations for her incorrect answer to Section 23d. In \nher response to the FORM, Applicant restates the judge\u2019s advice and explains, \u201cI didn\u2019t \nunderstand if I was really charged or not. And apparently I\u2019m still confused about this same \nmatter. If at a hearing your case is dropped (are you really still charged or does it still remain \nover your head forever).\u201d  Her mother\u2019s statement indicates, \u201cRelating to the citation, I sat in \ncourt and heard the judge say this will not show up on your record, so I am in the same feeling as \n[my daughter], that the charges were dropped; and it was unnecessary to be mentioned.\u201d \n    \n    \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation\u201d (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the AGs are \ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which a judge uses \nto determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. AG \u00b6 2. A judge\u2019s over-arching goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d a judge considers all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, a judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n12 Item 5, sworn interview of Applicant at 2-3 is the source for this sentence and the next sentence. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n5\n                                                          \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nnational security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, a judge must draw only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, a judge must avoid drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d13 \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which \ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to \napplicant to present \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by the [Government], and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).14\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends normal \nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \nunder this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of a judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n \n \n \n13 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the \npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from \nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n14\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \nGuideline \u00b6 24 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning drug involvement \nstating, \u201c[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d15\nTwo Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d16 and an \u201cillegal drug possession, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.\u201d Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). The other six disqualifying conditions listed in \nGuideline \u00b6 25 are not applicable. \nThe two disqualifying conditions in Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply because \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana without a prescription.  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. Guideline \u00b6 26 \nprovides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n                                                          \n15Guideline \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, \nstimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). \nThe Controlled Substances Act, appears generally as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 et seq.  Marijuana is listed at Schedule I \n(c)(10). \n \n16 Guideline \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n7\n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but \nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of \nabuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the drug \noffenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nthey are unlikely to recur. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \n\u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record \nwithin the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d Id. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in \nAugust 2006, which is too recent. However, she receives some credit for ending her marijuana \nuse in August 2006, and for not using any drugs for about six months before providing her \nresponse to the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (indicating \nwhen a mitigating condition cannot be fully applied, \u201csome credit\u201d is still available under that \nsame mitigating condition).    \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate her intent not to abuse illegal drugs \nin the future. The first three are applicable. She has \u201csignificantly\u201d disassociated from drug-using \nassociates and contacts; avoided the environment where drugs were used; and abstained from \ndrug abuse since August 2006. She only used marijuana seven times between 2003 and 2006, and \ndid not use any other illegal drugs. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable and significantly mitigates the \nsecurity concerns involving her drug involvement.  \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not applicable because her marijuana abuse did not follow an illness, and \nmarijuana was never prescribed for her. AG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable because she has not \ncompleted a prescribed drug treatment program, and there has not been a favorable prognosis by \na duly qualified medical professional.  \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving . . . lack of candor [or] dishonesty . . . can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the . . \n. clearance process . . . .\u201d  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n8\n                                                          \nTwo personal conduct disqualifying conditions are particularly relevant and may be \ndisqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 16(a) and (b) provide: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire . . . [used to] determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness . . . .; and,   \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative. \nApplicant gave an incorrect answer in Section 23 of her July 18, 2006, SF 86, and failed \nto disclose her charge of underage possession of alcohol. The evidence of record establishes her \nerroneous answer was a deliberate falsification.17 She understood the question, and was aware of \nthe charge as it was dismissed the previous month.  \n \nOn November 1, 2006, a DoD investigator interviewed Applicant, and she falsely said \nshe did not disclose the underage possession of alcohol because at the time she completed her SF \n86 it was not adjudicated.18   \n \nApplicant subsequently asserted in her response to the FORM that she told the judge, \nwho adjudicated the possession of alcohol charge, she would be going through the security \nclearance process, and he stated, \u201cBeing cleared shows up as nothing \u2013 it never happened.\u201d  Most \nlikely a judge would be aware that there would be some record of the charge, and it is unlikely a \njudge would recommend that Applicant not disclose the existence of the charge. Her mother\u2019s \nstatement provides very limited corroboration about the judge\u2019s statement because it most likely \nindicates the judge was advising Applicant there was no record of conviction.19 In any event it is \n \n17The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving \nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally \npermissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case \nunder Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission.   \n \n18 As indicated previously, the judge found her Not Guilty on June 27, 2006, and she signed her SF 86 on \nJuly 18, 2006. \n  \n19Administrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d ISCR Case \n02-03186 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006). Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to present \ndocumentary evidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. \n14, 2004) (holding Applicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative evidence may be used in \ncommon sense evaluation to determine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are established). In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of evidence, lack \nof corroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence suspect, unreliable, or \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n9\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s false statement to the DoD investigator about her rationale for not disclosing the \ncharge which receives greater weight because it is in closer temporal proximity to her signature \non her SF 86 than her subsequent statement about being misled by the judge. Her answer to the \nDoD investigator is clearly false, and it is not attributed to the judge or anyone else.     \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists six mitigating conditions that could mitigate security concerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically \nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated \nfully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress; and, \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nOn January 30, 2005, Applicant received a speeding ticket. However, it is her only \nspeeding ticket, and is not sufficiently serious and recent to be a security concern. Her underage \npossession of alcohol offense resulted in a finding of not guilty. She denied that she possessed \nalcohol on that occasion, and this offense is unsubstantiated. Her last use of marijuana was after \nshe completed her SF 86; however, as indicated previously her drug involvement is mitigated.  \nFor SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2a, 2b and 2e, I find for Applicant.   \n \nApplicant admitted that her answer on Section 23 of her SF 86 was incorrect, and she \nprovided inaccurate information to the DoD investigator. However, she did not admit she \nintended to deceive security officials or the DoD investigator. Instead she eventually attributed \nher false answer on her SF 86 to advice received from the judge who adjudicated her underage \n \nincredible. . . . Evidence that lacks corroboration must be evaluated in terms of its intrinsic \nbelievability and in light of all the other evidence of record, including evidence that tends to \nsupport it as well as evidence that tends to detract from it.   \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n10\npossession of alcohol charge. She also argued that a charge did not need to be disclosed unless it \nresulted in a conviction. She did not fully acknowledge her conduct, and she has not received \ncounseling. Her falsifications are recent, serious and not mitigated.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \nIn addition to the facts discussed in the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nI have considered each of the factors related to the whole person concept under AG \u00b6 2(a). As \nnoted above, her two falsifications were directly related to the security clearance process. They \noccurred in 2006. Although she admitted her answers were incorrect, she failed to acknowledge \nthat she intended to deceive security officials and a DoD investigator.  Her falsifications were \nvoluntary and deliberate.  She was not coerced into making the false statements. \n \nApplicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence. She is only 20 years \nold. The absence of evidence of any prior violation of her employer\u2019s rules or requirements, and \nher efforts in sports and academics at her university weigh in her favor. She is loyal to her \ncountry. This process has made her aware of the necessity to provide accurate information during \nthe security clearance process. \u201cApplicant is now alert to the security concerns presented by h[er] \ncircumstances and the responsibilities incumbent on h[er] as a result.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-07360 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006). This case has sensitized her to the importance of accurate \ninformation on her SF 86. She provided a strong package of recommendations lauding her \ncharacter, diligence, leadership and integrity, as well as other traits.     \n \nEvidence of rehabilitation and Applicant\u2019s good character, however, is insufficient to \nresolve my doubts about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The overall record \nevidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to her security eligibility and suitability. I take \nthis position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nOn May 16, 2006, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF\n86). On April 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the security concerns under Guideline F to\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 26, 2007, but it did not comply\nwith instructions on the form of an Answer.  She filed another Answer on June 18, 2007.\nShe requested her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn December 6, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written\ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the\nApril 17, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant. She was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on December 13, 2007.\nApplicant did not file a response to the FORM within the 30 day time allowed that would\nhave expired on January 12, 2008. I received the case assignment on March 27, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answers to the SOR, dated April 26, 2007, and June 18, 2007, Applicant\nadmitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.e, and 1.g to 1.i of the SOR, with\nexplanations. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f of the SOR. She also\nprovided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  \nApplicant is 45 years old, divorced, and has five children and six grandchildren.\nShe works as a security guard for a defense contractor.  Applicant has nine delinquent\ndebts totaling $27,163 as listed in the SOR.  These delinquent debts are for telephone\nservice, medical bills, student loans, an auto loan for a repossessed car, credit card\ndebt, and utility bills.  Applicant denies knowing the origin of a telephone bill for $331\n(Subparagraph 1.a), and a debt owed to a collector for $252 (Subparagraph 1.f) (Items\n3, 5)\nApplicant admits she is not able to repay her debts in a timely and reasonable\nmanner.  She continues to pay some of them, and works hard for her income.  She\ntakes care of her family as a single parent, and does not drink or use illegal drugs. (Item\n5)\nThe credit reports, dated May 31, 2006, and February 16, 2007, pertaining to\nApplicant show that the delinquent debts listed in the SOR are due and owing by her.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer does not present a repayment plan for any of these debts.  She\ndoes not explain how she incurred these debts, nor how or when she intends to repay\nthem.  Applicant does not present any evidence of her financial circumstances in her\nAnswer.  Her SF-86 admits she was over 90 days delinquent on some debts (Question\n28b), and she listed her student loan for $9,468 as delinquent.  The SOR alleges her\nstudent loan debt is $15,394 which Applicant admitted is a correct amount.  That\ncreditor is deducting payments from her paycheck, and took her income tax refund.\nShe asserted she began making payments in January 15, 2007, but did not provide\ndocumentary evidence to support her assertion. The delinquent debts listed in the SOR\nare unpaid and owing by Applicant. (Items 7, 8)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n3\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n4\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt that\nshe was unwilling or unable to pay her financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant did\nnot provide any evidence that would support the application of this mitigating condition.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant did not provide\nany evidence to support this mitigating condition being applied to her case.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ AG \u00b6 20(e) applies where an Applicant has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of a debt.  Applicant supplied no evidence that would\nsupport the application of any of these mitigating conditions.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n5\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems began,\nApplicant was a mature adult. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) She accumulated debt, but does not\nexplain how or why she did. (See AG & 2(a)(2).)  There is no evidence of rehabilitation\nor a change in her behavior regarding debt accumulation. (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  Applicant\nhas no arrangements to repay or resolve these delinquent debts, and they could be a\nsource of improper pressure or duress. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Of course, the issue is not\nsimply whether all her debts are paid.  It is whether her financial circumstances raise\nconcerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. While these debts remain\nunpaid or unresolved, they are sufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations.  I conclude that security concern against Applicant.  I conclude the\n\u201cwhole person concept\u201d against Applicant also.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny \nher application, citing security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 21, 2007. She answered \nthe SOR in writing on October 2, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on October 3, 2007. Department \nCounsel filed notice that he was ready to proceed on November 26, 2007, and I \nreceived the case assignment on November 28, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non November 30, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 19, \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2007. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf, offered the testimony of one witness, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 4, 2008, to \nsubmit additional matters.  On December 28, 2007, she submitted AX G, which was \nadmitted without objection.  Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX G is attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HX) II.  The record closed on January 4, 2008, and DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on the same day. Based on the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of adjudicative \nfacts about relating to the Republic of Belarus. The request and the attached documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were attached to the record as HX I.  I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request, without objection from Applicant (Tr. 22).  The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in the SOR \nand offered explanations.  Her explanations are incorporated in my findings of fact.  I \nmake the following findings:  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old consultant for a federal contractor.  She was born in \nRussia and was 16 years old when the Soviet Union broke up (Tr. 53-54).  She became \na citizen of Belarus after it became independent.  She met her husband, a U.S. citizen \nand career foreign service officer, after she was employed by the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development in 1997 to help bring democracy to Belarus. Her husband \nhas been a Foreign Service officer for 26 years and held security clearances for much \nof his career (Tr. 31-32).  Applicant taught Belarusian journalists how to use \ninternational internet sources to break through the government\u2019s monopoly on \ninformation (Tr. 43). She and her husband were married in January 1999.  She came to \nthe U.S. in June 1999, and became a U.S. citizen in February 2004.   \n \nA former U.S. ambassador to Belarus, now the ambassador to another country, \nobserved that Applicant \u201cdisplayed the keen eye of a business manager, the political \ninstincts I expect from experienced diplomats, and cooperative and persuasive \ninterpersonal skills.\u201d  The former ambassador trusted Applicant, described her as \u201ca \nperson of the highest character and integrity,\u201d and strongly recommended that she be \ngranted a security clearance (AX A). \n \nA journalist who worked with Applicant in Belarus and has continued their \nfriendship described her as \u201csomeone of thoughtful, sincere, and committed conviction.\u201d  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nShe described the great personal risks Applicant took on behalf of an independent \npress in an atmosphere of government oppression (AX C). \n \nApplicant worked at the Defense Contract Management Agency from early 2004 \nto 2006.  Her supervisor described her as intelligent, capable, and a \u201cparticularly \nhonest\u201d employee (AX B).  She worked for the TRICARE Management Activity from \nJanuary 2006 to October 2007, where her TRICARE supervisor spoke highly of her \nhonesty, integrity, and good judgment (AX D). \n \nApplicant obtained a Belarusian passport in April 1999, before she came to the \nU.S. and became a U.S. citizen.  The passport does not expire until 2009.  She formally \nrenounced her Belarusian citizenship and surrendered her passport in September 2007 \n(Tr.49-50; AX G).  She has no documents reflecting surrender of the passport, but her \nhusband corroborated her testimony about surrendering it (Tr. 47).  She was advised by \nembassy officials that it could take up to two years for the Belarusian government to \nprovide her with a document reflecting that she is no longer a citizen of Belarus (Tr. 49-\n50).  The Belarusian consul tried to persuade her to retain dual citizenship, but she \ninsisted she wanted nothing to do with Belarus (Tr. 53). \n \nApplicant owned an apartment and a house in Belarus for use by her parents, but \nshe transferred title to both properties to her parents in September 2007 (AX E and F).  \nThe value of Applicant\u2019s Belarusian property was about $40,000.  By comparison, her \nassets in the U.S. are worth about $1.4 million (Tr. 51). \n \nApplicant did not relinquish the property earlier because she was advised by her \nlawyer to keep it in her name until her parents, then citizens of Russia, became \nBelarusian citizens.  They became Belarusian citizens in July or August 2007 (Tr. 50). \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents have been retired for about ten years.  They have never been \ninvolved in politics or connected with the government of Belarus (Tr. 51). Her mother \nwas a kindergarten music teacher, and her father was an equipment engineer at a meat \npacking factory in Russia.  Both receive pensions from the government of Belarus (Tr. \n56).  She has telephonic contact with her parents once a week (Tr. 52). \n \nApplicant has considered what she would do if her parents were subjected to \npressure by the Belarusian government.  She has decided she would never deal with \nthe Belarusian government because it is so untrustworthy (Tr. 51).   \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts.  Belarus declared its \nsovereignty in July 1990 and its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991.  \nThe U.S. recognized Belarus as an independent state in December 1991. It is nominally \na democratic republic, but it is in fact an autocratic regime ruled by its president, who \nhas systematically undermined its democratic institutions and concentrated power in the \nexecutive branch of government by flawed referenda, manipulated elections, and \narbitrary decrees.  Belarusian authorities have severely restricted the constitutional \nrights of its citizens.  There have been sweeping violations of human rights during \n\n \n4 \n \n \nelections, including disregard for freedom of assembly, association, and expression.  \nElections have been conducted in a climate of insecurity, fear, and problematic vote \ncounts.  Belarus exports significant quantities of defense materials, dual-use items, \nweapons, and weapons-related technology to countries of concern to the U.S., including \nstate sponsors of terrorism.  It has attempted to expand relations to countries of \nconcern, including Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Naturalized U.S. citizens from Belarus do \nnot automatically lose Belarusian citizenship.  Children born before August 15, 2002, \neven if born in the U.S. and in possession of a U.S. passport, are considered Belarusian \ncitizens until 16 and will not be given a Belarusian visa for travel to Belarus.  Such \nchildren cannot leave Belarus without a Belarusian passport. \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request to take administrative notice did not address \neconomic or military espionage. No evidence was presented that Belarus actively \ncollects economic or military intelligence.  Applicant\u2019s husband testified he was not \naware of any \u201csignificant history\u201d of Belarusian attempts to cultivate intelligence sources \nin the U.S. (Tr. 44). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the \napplicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The government has \nthe burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual Belarus-U.S. citizenship (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \npossessed an active Belarusian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \nand owns property in Belarus (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The concern under Guideline C is as follows: \n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG \u00b6 9.  A disqualifying \ncondition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a \ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  A disqualifying condition also may arise from \n\u201cusing foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(5). \n  \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of an active Belarusian passport after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  However, there is no evidence she used her \ndual citizenship to protect her property in Belarus.  Possession of property in a foreign \ncountry is not an enumerated disqualification under Guideline C.  There is no evidence \nthat citizenship is a requirement for ownership of property in Belarus, and there is no \nevidence that Applicant held onto the property in anticipation of living in Belarus.  \nTherefore, I conclude AG 10(a)(5) is not raised.  Except for AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), no other \nenumerated disqualifying conditions under Guideline C are raised by the evidence. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden \nof proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n11(a).  Applicant was born in Russia of Russian parents.  Her parents recently became \ncitizens of Belarus.  The record is sparse on this issue, but at some point after her \nsixteenth birthday Applicant became a citizen of Belarus, even though her parents \ncontinued to be citizens of Russia.  It is not clear whether Applicant became a citizen of \nBelarus by operation of law when Belarus became independent, or whether she took \nsome affirmative action to become a citizen of Belarus.  I conclude AG \u00b6 11(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  This mitigating \ncondition is established by Applicant\u2019s renunciation of her Belarusian citizenship in \nSeptember 2007. \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by showing that \u201cexercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a \nU.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(c).  Applicant acquired her \nBelarusian passport before she became a U.S. citizen, but she retained it until \nSeptember 2007, long after she became a U.S. citizen.  I conclude AG \u00b6 11(c) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition was \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s surrender of her passport to the Belarusian consul.  Although \nApplicant has no documentary proof that she surrendered her passport, her testimony \nand answer to the SOR declaring that she surrendered it was corroborated by the \ntestimony of her husband, a U.S. senior foreign service officer.  I found her testimony \ncredible. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s parents of citizens of Russia residing in Belarus \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), Applicant owns an apartment and a house in Belarus valued at about \n$40,000, and her parents manage the properties and reside in the house (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  \nFirst, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Finally, a security \nconcern may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a \nforeign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s weekly contacts with her parents and continued concern for them are \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).  However, AG \u00b6 7(e) is not raised because she \nhas transferred ownership of her Belarusian property to her parents. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).   \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.   \n \n \nApplicant has regular, weekly contact with her parents, and she remains \nconcerned for their welfare, as evidenced by her transfer of ownership in two properties \nin Belarus to ensure that her parents have a place to live.  Her parents are retired and \nhave never been politically active.  They receive government pensions, but have also \nreceived substantial assistance from Applicant through the transfer of the two properties \nin Belarus.  The extent to which they are dependent on their government pensions is \nunclear.  They live under an oppressive government with a poor human rights record.  \nHowever, government oppression has been directed at stifling dissent and enhancing \npresidential power. There is no evidence of Belarusian economic or military intelligence \noperations against the U.S.  Thus, Applicant\u2019s parents are vulnerable to government \noppression and coercion, but such abuse is not likely to be intelligence-related.  I \nconclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is established, because it is not likely that Applicant would have to \nchoose between the interests of her parents and the interests of the U.S.   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family \nmembers could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family \nmembers were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.  The Appeal \nBoard consistently applied this mitigating narrowly, holding that its underlying premise \nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to \nmake a choice between the interests of the family member and the interests of the U.S. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 \nat 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); \nISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge \nwas not permitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  \nUnder the new guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed \n\n \n9 \n \n \nto determine if an applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \nApplicant feels no loyalty to Belarus.  Her testimony at the hearing, combined \nwith her body language and vocal inflection, made her distaste for the current regime in \nBelarus obvious.  However, she does have strong feelings of obligation to her parents.  \nAs noted above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 8(a), government oppression or abuse \nagainst her parents is not likely to be intelligence-related.  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. are very strong.  She has been married for nine \nyears to a senior Foreign Service officer with a security clearance.  She has been a U.S. \ncitizen for four years. While working in Belarus from 1997 to 1999, she demonstrated \ngreat courage by teaching journalists how to overcome the Belarusian government\u2019s \nmonopoly on information.  She has earned a reputation from numerous supervisors, \nincluding a former ambassador, for strength of character, integrity, and good judgment. \nShe does not trust the current Belarusian government.  Because of her distrust, I am \nsatisfied she would not yield to duress applied through her parents, in part because she \nwould not trust any Belarusian promises to refrain from abusing her parents in return for \nher disloyalty to the U.S.  Although a conflict of interest in this case is extremely \nunlikely, I am satisfied that any Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S.  Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of these factors were addressed \nabove under Guidelines C and B, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature woman of extraordinary courage and strong convictions.  \nShe has witnessed Belarusian oppression first hand and confronted it. She has worked \nfor the U.S. in various capacities since 1997. She has thoughtfully considered the \npotential impact of her security clearance application on her parents.  She was sincere, \ncandid, and credible during her testimony at the hearing. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C and \nB, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence.  \nAccordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nMy formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Micro-graphic Computer Repair Technician, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions abut his ability to protect classified information. The Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. The Applicant has worked in the defense industry since August 1980, almost twenty-nine years. Over the years he has been promoted numerous times, and has experienced a lay off and was called back. He held a secret level security clearance without interruption since 1985/86. Other than the two incidents described below, he has never committed any company violations or security violations.

On November 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 8, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on January 30, 2009.  A notice of hearing was originally issued on\nFebruary 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 27, 2009.  Due to difficulty with\nthe confirmation of the Government\u2019s court reporting contract, the hearing was\ncontinued.  A notice of hearing was issued again on March 11, 2009, scheduling the\nhearing for April 10, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented three exhibits\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3.  The Applicant presented two exhibits,\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The\n\n2\nrecord remained open until close of business on April 17, 2009, to allow the Applicant\nthe opportunity to submit additional documentation.  Applicant requested a one week\nextension until April 24, 2009, which was granted.  Applicant submitted one Post-\nHearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, within the requested\ntime period.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on April 20, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 51 years old and divorced.  He has a high school diploma and\none year of junior college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Micro-graphic\nComputer Repair Technician, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions abut his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  The Applicant has worked in the defense industry since August 1980, almost\ntwenty-nine years.  Over the years he has been promoted numerous times, and has\nexperienced a lay off and was called back.   He held a secret level security clearance\nwithout interruption since 1985/86.  Other than the two incidents described below, he\nhas never committed any company violations or security violations.  \n        \nFrom July 2003 to October 2004, the Applicant was on lay off status with his\nemployer.  He was called back to work in October 2004.  He received a company credit\ncard in late 2004, early 2005.  Between April 24, 2005, and August 14, 2006, the\nApplicant used the company credit card that was issued to him for exclusively business\npurposes to make personal purchases in the amount of $13,710.88 in violation of\ncompany policy.  He testified that he made a car payment, bought tires, got cash\nadvances and took his girlfriend on a weekend vacation to Hawaii.  (Tr. pp. 43-44).\nDuring this time he was paying child support to his ex-wife, insurance and living\nexpenses, and did not have any extra money to do other things.  As a result of an\ninvestigation into his misuse of his corporate card, he was suspended from work without\npay for ten work days.  (Government Exhibit 3).  \nApplicant testified that he did not have a personal credit card at the time.  (Tr. p.\n24).  He knew it was against company policy to use his company credit card for\npersonal purchases, but he did it anyway.  Applicant admitted his wrongdoing and within\na week, before any disciplinary action was taken by the company, he paid the debt off in\nfull.  Applicant states that he will never do it again and will no longer possess a\ncompany credit card even if offered one.  (Tr. p. 49).  Applicant testified that he was\n\n3\ninformed by the company that after one year, without further violations, this corrective\naction would be removed from his personnel record.  (Tr. pp. 40-41).  \n  \nIn approximately December 2005, the Applicant spent approximately 69.2 hours\naccessing personal and pornographic web-sites during business hours.  The Applicant\nstated that between computer repair jobs, while at work, on his company computer, he\nwould check sport sites and at times he clicked on his e-mail sites that contained\npornographic material.  Each time, he tried to get out of the program, it failed to respond\nand he had to turn his computer off to get everything to stop.  (Tr. p. 31).  Applicant\ntestified that the violation was discovered when his computer was monitored remotely\nfrom another site.  \nApplicant admitted the misconduct when confronted by the company investigator.\nHe stated that he understood at the time of the wrongdoing that his conduct was against\ncompany policy.  As a result, he received a one week disciplinary layoff without pay.\n(Government Exhibit 3).  Applicant states that he now only opens up company e-mail.\n(Tr. p. 50).  Applicant testified that he was informed by the company that after one year,\nwithout further violations, this corrective action would be removed from his personnel\nrecord.  (Tr. p. 40-41).   \n  \nApplicant also testified that he would never jeopardize classified information\nunder any circumstances.  When offered a hypothetical by Department Counsel,\nApplicant stated that even if a foreign power were trying to black mail him by eliciting\nclassified information from him in lieu of telling his children that he was on pornographic\nsites at work.  (Tr. p. 37).\nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s union representative, coworkers\nand friends all attest to the Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability.  Applicant is\nconsidered to be a hardworking team player who is honest and dependable.  He is\nrecommended for a continued position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  Applicant has\nreceived numerous appreciation awards and certificates of achievement and recognition\nfor his exceptional performance and contributions to the defense industry over the past\ntwenty-nine years.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nA letter dated April 14, 2009, from a project manager who has supervised the\nApplicant, on several DoD programs,  stated that the Applicant \u201cneeded little oversight\u201d.\nHe took the initiative to do the work, and each time, always achieved the best yield the\nprogram had ever seen in its history.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\n\n4\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of\nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources;\n16.(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that\ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States may service as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other\ngroup.\n  \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n17(c)   the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n17(e)  the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n\n5\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\n\n6\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's personal conduct has a direct and negative\nimpact on his suitability for access to classified information.  \nThe evidence shows that over the past twenty-nine years, the Applicant has\ncommitted two violations of company policy and procedure.  In 2005-2006, he used his\ncompany credit card for personal use, and in 2005, he accessed pornographic sites on\nhis company computer.  He received company disciplinary action for both violations.  He\nrealizes the seriousness of his misconduct and is extremely remorseful.  When the\nviolation was discovered, he immediately paid off the company credit card, and to avoid\nany future problems, he refuses to possess one.  He no longer opens any e-mail other\nthan the company\u2019s.  He states that he has learned a harsh lesson from this experience\nand understands that the Government will not tolerate violations of company policy\nwhile holding a security clearance. \n    \nUnder Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 16.(d) credible adverse information\nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself\nfor an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of\ndishonesty or rule violations, (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources and 16.(e) personal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that\ncountry but illegal in the United States may service as a basis for exploitation or\npressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group apply.  \nHowever, under the particular facts of this case, Mitigating Conditions 17(c) the\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment and, 17(e)  the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress also applies.  The Applicant\u2019s misconduct in 2005/2006 was\nclearly an aberration from his normal, responsible pattern of behavior.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  His twenty-nine years of dedicated service\nto the defense industry as well as his favourable references have also been considered.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or\n\n7\nother characteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, Applicant has mitigated the negative\neffects of his company violations and the impact that they can have on his ability to\nsafeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has\novercome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Michael V. Davis, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 30, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance needed to renew a\nsecurity clearance he held since about 1996 as part of his employment with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to give Applicant a security clearance. On August 17, 2007, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline J (criminal\n2\nconduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on October 2, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on November\n5, 2007. However, on October 18, 2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney requested a continuance\ndue to a schedule conflict. I subsequently rescheduled the hearing for November 19,\n2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted five exhibits\noffered by the government (Gx. 1 - 5). Applicant testified in his own behalf, and offered\nfour exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - D.\nHe also presented two witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 28,\n2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\nApplicant\u2019s request to renew his security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was arrested on August 29,\n2002; that he had a blood alcohol content of .12% and was charged with driving or\nattempting to drive a vehicle while under the influence (DUI); and that he was found\nguilty,  fined and placed on probation for one year. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the government\nalleged Applicant was arrested on March 18, 2005, and charged with the same offense\nas specified in SOR \u00b6 1.a; and that he was found guilty and placed on probation for two\nyears effective in December 2005. In SOR \u00b6 1.c, the government alleged Applicant was\narrested on July 15, 2006, was charged with second degree assault, and that the\ncharge was nolle prosequi in October 2006.\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted without explanation all of the\nallegations therein. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 51 years old and has worked for the same defense contractor since\n1996 as a facilities technician. He has held a security clearance throughout his tenure at\nthe company. Before 1996, Applicant was self-employed in the trucking business and\nother occupations for about 15 years. By all accounts, he has been an exemplary\nemployee. People who know him in the workplace and in the community speak highly of\nhis reliability, honesty, integrity, and professionalism. According to an associate and a\nsupervisor at work, there have been no incidents or problems with Applicant\u2019s handling\nof classified information or with his access to classified facilities. (Ax. A)\nApplicant\u2019s arrest in 2002 occurred after he and friend had been drinking at a\nlocal establishment. Part of his sentence included mandatory alcohol counselling at a\n\n3\nlocal treatment center. Applicant attended 12 sessions of outpatient counselling over 12\nweeks.\nApplicant has three brothers. His parents are both deceased, with his father\nhaving passed away in October 2005 after a long battle with heart disease. Applicant\nlives in a house on a five-acre tact of land where his father\u2019s house also sits. It was not\nunusual for Applicant to drive rather than walk to his father\u2019s house. In doing so, he did\nnot drive on any public roads.\nApplicant was his father\u2019s primary caregiver in the last year of life, and was often\nstressed and upset over his father\u2019s condition. When Applicant was arrested in March\n2005, he had been drinking at his father\u2019s house after taking his father to the doctor. His\nfather was being tested and treated for a serious heart condition that would prove fatal\nlater that year, and they had received a poor prognosis that day. Applicant had at least\ntwo or three mixed drinks before leaving his father\u2019s house in the evening. He got into\nhis car and sat there for a few minutes with the lights on. As Applicant started to drive\naway from his father\u2019s house, two police officers who had observed him the state road\nalong which his property sits, drove onto the property and stopped him. They\ndetermined he had been drinking and arrested him. Applicant insisted he had not\nbroken any laws because he was driving on private property, so he refused a\nbreathalyser test. \nAfter several continuances, Applicant was convicted at a bench trial and\nsentenced as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Gx. 5) He served seven days of a ten-day jail\nsentence. Beginning in December 2005, Applicant was placed on two years of\nsupervised probation. He was ordered to attend 26 weeks of outpatient counselling,\nwhich he completed at the same center he attended in 2002. Applicant attended nearly\n90 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. A device was placed on his car until September\n2006 that would prevent him from starting the car if there were alcohol in his system.\nAs part of his supervised probation, Applicant was ordered to report to a\nprobation officer once a month, and to submit to random urinalysis testing. He was also\nordered to abstain completely from alcohol. As of October 2007, his probation officer\nexpected Applicant would be released from his probation on time as he had complied\nwith all of the terms of his probation. (Ax. D)\nAll of the urinalysis tests administered to Applicant during his probation were\nnegative for alcohol or drugs. However, Applicant has acknowledged drinking alcohol in\nmoderation on occasion during his probation. (Tr., 52 - 53, 68)\nApplicant has been legally separated from his wife since 1995. They were first\nmarried in November 1977. In 2006, Applicant had a girlfriend who was prone to erratic\nbehavior. After they got into an argument one day in July 2006, she tried to take his car\nafter she had been drinking. Applicant tried to physically restrain her, but she managed\nto drive away. Applicant reported the incident to the police. When they found his\ngirlfriend, she reported she had been assaulted. Applicant was then arrested and\ncharged with assault. The charge was never prosecuted, and the incident did not violate\nhis probation.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n4\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n4\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties at hearing require consideration of the security concerns and\nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline J (criminal conduct) at AG \u00b6 30.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\n\n  See, Rettig v. State, 34 __ 419; 639 A. 2d 670 (1994). Applicant\u2019s attorney argued that if he had represented\n8\nApplicant in the 2005 case, he surely would have appealed the verdict. However, such an appeal more\nprobably would have focused on whether the police had probable cause to enter Applicant\u2019s property and\ndetain him in the first place.\n5\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct.\nUnder Guideline J, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) The government\npresented sufficient information to support the allegations of criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a and 1.b. There is not sufficient information to show that Applicant engaged in\ncriminal conduct when he was arrested in July 2006, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.\nApplicant\u2019s arrests in 2002 and 2005, and his probationary status as of the hearing\nrequire consideration of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on\nparole or probation). \nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant\u2019s position is that, because\nhe was not on a public road when he was charged with DUI in 2005, he was not\nengaged in criminal conduct. However, the courts in his state have ruled on such\narguments and have held the laws against driving under the influence do not limit such\nconduct to public roads.  Thus, the issue is whether (a) enough time has passed since\n8\nApplicant\u2019s last instance of criminal conduct, (b) circumstances have changed such that\nit is unlikely he will again engage in such conduct, and (c) Applicant is sufficiently\nrehabilitated from his earlier conduct. If answered in the affirmative, the mitigating\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;)\nand AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement) should be considered.\nApplicant was on probation at the time of his hearing on November 19, 2007. He\nwas due to be released from that status on December 16, 2007, because, as his\nprobation officer wrote, \u201c[Applicant] has followed his order of probation with no\nviolations.\u201d (Ax. D) However, because Applicant did not \u201c[t]otally abstain from alcohol\u201d\n(Ax D.) as required by the terms of his probation, it appears his probation officer was\nmisinformed. The Directive\u2019s adjudicative guidelines, such as AG 31 (d), are not to be\napplied in an inflexible or unreasonable manner. Without more, the fact Applicant was\non probation for another three weeks after the hearing may not have been disqualifying.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s willing disobedience of a court order that addressed the underlying\nsource of the charges of which he was convicted. Based on the foregoing, Applicant has\nfailed to present information sufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns about his\ncriminal conduct.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n6\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline J. I have also reviewed\nthe record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG 2(a).9\nApplicant is a mature adult who is well-respected in his community and at work. He has\nbeen a responsible and reliable employee since 1996, and there is no indication he has\never mishandled classified information or access to classified facilities. However, the\npositive information about his job performance and personal life is insufficient to mitigate\nthe ongoing doubts about his suitability for continued access raised by his criminal\nconduct and failure to abide by the terms of his probation. Because protection of the\nnational interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in\nfavor of the national interest.  \n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 19, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 28, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant used marijuana from 1980 through 2004, at times as much\nas 150 times per year.  He also found that Applicant purchased marijuana 50-60 times over the years,\nspending thousands of dollars, and used cocaine with his wife on two occasions between 1986 and\n1989.  Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant concealed his history of drug use by falsifying\na job application with his current employer, by falsifying earlier security clearance applications, and\nfinally by falsifying a July 2004 application for a clearance upgrade.  In each instance, Applicant\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to pertinent questions about drug use.  The Judge found that Applicant acknowledged\nthat he falsified his clearance applications because he did not want his employer and the government\nto know about his drug abuse history.\nThe Judge concluded that the government established a case for disqualification under both\nGuidelines H and E.  After noting Applicant\u2019s extensive drug history, the Judge concluded that a\nlittle over three years of abstinence was inadequate to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns.\nThe Judge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications were not mitigated.\nOn appeal, Applicant asserts: (a) the Judge\u2019s decision misstated the period of Applicant\u2019s\nheaviest marijuana use; (b) the Judge\u2019s decision contains a misstatement when it asserts that\nApplicant \u201cdefeated\u201d a pre-employment drug screen; (c) the Judge improperly discounted the\ntestimony of Applicant\u2019s professional character witnesses, as evidenced by his statement, \u201cTellingly,\nneither of them was aware of the issues in this case.\u201d; (d) in the last sentence of his Conclusions\nsection, the Judge mistakenly resolved Guideline J against Applicant, indicating that the Judge gave\ncursory attention to the case; (e) the Adjudicative Desk Reference contains the proper approach to\nmaking a common sense decision based on the whole-person concept, and under its provisions, the\nJudge should have concluded that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was no longer of security concern; (f)\nthe Judge\u2019s attitude indicated a personal prejudice against those who admit marijuana use and he was\ntherefore predisposed to find against Applicant; and (g) the concealing of the marijuana use was, to\nApplicant at the time, part of his ongoing marijuana use, and it was unreasonable and arbitrary and\ncapricious for the Judge to consider those falsifications unmitigated  in light of Applicant\u2019s excellent\nprofessional history and his current understanding of his untruthfulness as a separate and very serious\nissue of its own.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief does not establish harmful error with regard to the alleged\nmisstatement of facts contained in the Judge\u2019s decision.  After a review of the Judge\u2019s decision and\nthe record evidence as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s characterizations complained\nabout by Applicant are a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  Moreover, the Judge was\n\n3\nentitled to take into account the character witnesses\u2019 lack of knowledge concerning the facts of the\ncase when deciding how much weight to afford the testimony of those witnesses.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge weighed the testimony of these witnesses in an arbitrary or capricious\nmanner.\nThe Judge erred when he resolved Guideline J against Applicant in the last sentence of his\nConclusions section, as no case had been brought against Applicant under Guideline J.  Applicant\nasserts that this error is indicative of the cursory attention the Judge showed his case.  However, the\nBoard will not view single sentences of a decision in isolation, but will instead consider them with\nreference to the decision as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10215 at 6 n. 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 30,\n2004).  The Judge correctly refers to Guidelines H and E in other parts of his decision, including the\nformal findings section.  The Board concludes that the error pointed out by Applicant is an isolated,\ntypographical one that had no bearing on the decision as a whole.  Concerning Applicant\u2019s assertion\nthat the error was indicative of a cursory attitude on the part of the Judge, there is a presumption in\nfavor of regularity and good faith on the part of DOHA judges as they engage in the process of\ndeciding cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0019 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 1999).  After a review\nof the Judge\u2019s decision and the overall record, the Board concludes Applicant has failed to overcome\nthat presumption.\nApplicant\u2019s reliance on portions of the Adjudicative Desk reference (ADF) is misplaced.\nDOHA judges are required to decide cases by using the Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADF.  The\nADF itself contains language indicating that it may not be cited as authority for denial or suspension\nof access.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005).  Given that language,\nApplicant cannot reasonably contend that the portions of the ADF cited by him constituted official\nU.S. government policy that the Judge was required to follow. \nThe portion of Applicant\u2019s brief that cites to the ADF also contains a lengthy narrative as to\nwhy he believes his history of drug use is mitigated.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that\nhe weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the recency and seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline H.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR Case No. 06-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Given the\nrecord that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline H\nis sustainable.\nBy asserting that the Judge was predisposed to rule against him because of personal views\nconcerning marijuana use, Applicant is effectively accusing the Judge of bias.  The Board has long\nheld that there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The Board has noted that the issue is not whether Applicant believes\n\n4\nthe Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather, the issue is whether the record\ncontains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to\nquestion the fairness or impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 5 (App. Bd.\nMar. 19, 2001).  In this case, after a review of the Judge\u2019s decision and the entirety of the record, the\nBoard concludes that Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating bias on the part of\nthe Judge.\nLastly, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s resolution of the falsification allegations under\nGuideline E.  Once the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to\nthe applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that the\nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsifications had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant\nstrongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications on his July 2004 clearance application, and the drug\nabuse history he concealed, render him unsuitable for a security clearance. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 19 July 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of drug\ninvolvement and personal conduct.  He answered the SOR 21 August 2007, and requested a hearing.\n1\n\nApplicant similarly falsified an employment application and defeated a pre-employment drug screen for his\n2\nprevious employer, as well as a prospective employer he interviewed with but did not go to work for.\nThese two clearance applications, and the results of the subject interview, are not in the hearing record,\n3\nand, for that reason, there are no SOR allegations based on these facts. I include these facts both as evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s poor credibility, and as a necessary portion of the narrative to place the SOR allegations in context.\n2\nDOHA assigned the case to me 2 October 2007, and I convened a hearing 2 November 2007. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 13 November 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as\nfindings of fact. He is a 43-year-old senior professional staffer, employed by a defense contractor\nsince August 2001. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained fraudulently in 2001.\nWhen Applicant applied for a job with his current employer, he falsified his employment\napplication by denying any history of illegal drug use. He passed a company pre-employment drug\nscreen\u2014which he knew was required\u2014by abstaining from marijuana use far enough in advance of\nthe test to test negative.  Shortly after going to work for this employer, Applicant applied for an\n2\nindustrial security clearance. He deliberately concealed his drug use by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions\ndesigned to elicit any illegal drug use. Based on his false answers, Applicant was granted an interim\nsecret clearance, and ultimately his permanent secret clearance. In 2002, Applicant applied for a\nclearance upgrade to top secret. Again he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions designed to elicit his illegal\ndrug use, and again he obtained first his interim top secret, then his permanent top secret (November\n2002), clearances. His background investigation for top secret access required a subject interview,\nduring which he confirmed his false answers to the drug questions.3\nIn July 2004, Applicant applied for a clearance upgrade to top secret/special compartment\ninformation (TS/SCI)(G.E. 1) and continued to conceal his drug use by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions\n27 (illegal drug use, last seven years), 28 (illegal drug use while possessing a security clearance), and\n29 (illegal drug purchases) . In fact, he had used marijuana from 1980 through 2004 on a recreational\nbasis\u2014the equivalent of an evening cocktail after getting home from work. His heaviest marijuana\nuse has been since 1986, during which time he estimates he used marijuana approximately 150 times\nper year. He also purchased marijuana 50-60 times over the years, spending thousands of dollars. He\nused cocaine twice (once with his wife) between 1986 and 1989. Applicant acknowledged that he\nfalsified his clearance applications because he did not want his employer and the government to\nknow about his drug abuse history.\nAs part of the process for obtaining special access, Applicant was scheduled for a lifestyle\npolygraph required by another government agency in conjunction with his July 2004 application.\nDuring the pre-examination interview, he disclosed that he had used marijuana, but dissembled on\nthe recency and frequency of that use. During the post-examination interview, Applicant disclosed\nthe full extent of his drug use after being confronted by the polygrapher. Applicant underwent a\nsecond polygraph in May 2005, apparently with satisfactory results.\n\n3\nApplicant accepts full responsibility for his drug use, and acknowledges the invalidity of his\npast rationalizations: that it was no more than the equivalent of an evening cocktail, and the\ngovernment could not or should not really be concerned about his level of drug use. He did, however,\nunderstand that drug use was illegal and prohibited by employer and governmental policies.\nApplicant states that he has not used any illegal drugs since August 2004, and vows never\nto use illegal drugs again. He used marijuana largely in the privacy of his home (in the master\nbedroom while his two children, ages 12 and seven were downstairs). However, he also used\nmarijuana with his wife. She was a sporadic user with Applicant, and used cocaine with him on one\noccasion in the late 1980's. She stopped using marijuana some time ago, and vouches (A.E. A) for\nhis being drug free since September 2004.\nApplicant has an excellent work record (A.E. B). His two company character references, both\nof whom testified and provided sworn statements (A.E. A), praised the quality of his work, his\ntrustworthiness, and his integrity. Tellingly, neither of them was aware of the issues in this case. One\nof them had given Applicant the option of telling him or not. Applicant opted not. Both witnesses\ntestified that it was important to be truthful on clearance applications, and they would have serious\nissues with an employee who was untruthful.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v.

[or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n4\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.4\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H,  and Applicant\n5\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana for more than 24\nyears are neither distant in time nor infrequent.  His abstinence from drug use\u2014just over three\n6\nyears\u2014is inadequate to demonstrate an intent to refrain from drug use in the future in the context\nof this case.   I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the future.  Accordingly,\n7\nI resolve Guideline H against Applicant.8\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal drug use from the\ngovernment.  He did so knowing that his illegal drug use was prohibited by both company and\n9\ngovernmental policies. But for the polygraph examination, he might never have disclosed the truth.\nFurther, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information was\nrelevant to a clearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the government from evaluating\nhis illegal drug use in a timely fashion, and at a time when such recent drug use would have raised\neven more significant security concerns. In addition, the government detrimentally relied on\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications in granting his clearances on two separate occasions. Finally, his disclosure\nof illegal drug use when confronted during his polygraph was neither prompt nor forthright. Indeed,\nfor practical purposes, it was forced from him.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer clearly establishes that he intended to conceal his illegal drug use from\nthe government and effect the course of his background investigation, whether he was successful in\neffecting the course of his investigation or not. However, in this case his falsifications did influence\nthe investigation, and he was granted his clearance, on two occasions.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use demonstrates a lack of candor required of\ncleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse\ninformation about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on\napplicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other\nsecurity concerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage assessments\nand limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates he is willing\nto put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E and J\nagainst Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 31, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September14,\n2005 (Government Exhibit 1).  On June 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on July 2, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non August 6, 2007.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on August\n22, 2007.  I received the case assignment on August 27, 2007.  DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on September 10, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\n\n2\nSeptember 26, 2007. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on October 5, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nOctober 10, 2007, to submit additional matters.  On October 10, 2007, he submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits E through J, without objection. The record closed on October 10,\n2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 61, married and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Deputy Manager and seeks to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant submits that the majority of his financial problems began when he\nwas laid off by his employer in 2001.  As a result of this layoff, the Applicant decided to\ninvest in a business franchise in November 2001.  The business never took off and, in\nDecember 2004, the business was closed down.  The Applicant invested his life savings\nin this franchise, and his total loss was between $500,000 and $800,000.  (Transcript at\n39-42.)  In March 2005 the Applicant was re-employed by current employer and has\nbeen employed with them since that time.\nAs will be discussed in more detail below, the Applicant is attempting to pay off\nhis delinquent debts one by one as he can.  His intention is to pay all of his past due\nindebtedness while staying current with his other debts.  (Transcript at 26-27.)\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Citi in the amount of at least\n$15,357.00 as of the date of the hearing.  This was a personal credit card that was used\nfor the business.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt and has no current\nintention to make payments on this debt.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2; Transcript at 23-\n28.)\n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits, and the available evidence indicates, that he has\nthree different credit card accounts with Bank of America.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 3.)\nAll have been sold to different collection agencies.  Two are discussed under\nsubparagraphs 1.e. and 1.f., below.  The Applicant negotiated a settlement on the third\naccount.  He has been making payments of $305.00 a month since December 2006.\nAs of September 2007 the balance had been reduced from $9,685.03 to $8,186.30.  At\nthe current rate of payment, it will take approximately two years for the Applicant to pay\nthis debt off.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and F; Transcript at 28-32.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Palisades / Bank One Chase\nin an original amount of $11,886.64.  He made a payment arrangement in November\n\n3\n2006 with the law firm handling the case for the creditor.  After an initial payment of\n$966.66, he has been paying $535.96 every month for this debt.  As of August 2007 the\nbalance has been reduced to $9,889.55.  At the current rate of payment, it will take\napproximately two years for the Applicant to pay this debt off.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B\nand E; Transcript at 32-36.)\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Citi in the amount of at least\n$13,812.00 as of the date of the hearing.  This was a personal credit card that was used\nfor the business.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt and has no current\nintention to make payments on this debt.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 1; Transcript at 36-\n37.)\n1.e.\nThis is one of the three Bank of America debts incurred by the Applicant.\nThis debt was paid by settlement by the Applicant in April 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C;\nTranscript at 37-38.)  This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\n1.f.\nThis is one of the three Bank of America debts incurred by the Applicant.\nHe has made arrangements with a successor bank in interest.  The debt has been\nreduced from $9,750.65 to $5,000.00.  As of September 2007, the Applicant was\ncurrent on this account and reduced the debt to $4,355.48.  He hopes to pay $150.00 a\nmonth towards this account.  At the current rate of payment, it will take over two years\nfor the Applicant to pay this debt off.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H; Transcript at 43-46.)\n1.g.\nThe Applicant made a payment arrangement with this creditor, who was a\nsuccessor in interest to Sears.  He began making payments in September 2006 and\ncompleted making payments in April 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G; Transcript at 46-47.)\nThis subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\n1.h.\nThe Applicant\u2019s stepson made a $20,000.00 gift to his father to enable the\nApplicant to pay off the franchise fees on his business and close it down.  The stepson\nprovided a statement saying that he gave this money to his father as a gift, though the\nApplicant views it as a loan.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I; Transcript at 42-43.)  This\nsubparagraph is found for the Applicant as the understanding of the alleged creditor is\nthat the money is a gift and not a loan.\nThe records indicate that, in addition to the past due debts discussed above,\nwhich total $51,600.33, the Applicant has 14 other credit cards or debts that were in a\ncurrent status as of April 2007.  He usually pays the minimum amount due on these\ndebts.  These debts totaled $38,508.00 as of April 2007.  His total indebtedness is\napproximately $90,108.33.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 15-16; Transcript at 57-62.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  He is described as a person who always displays \u201ca\nhigh degree of integrity, responsibility, and dedication to duty.\u201d  Several of the\n\n4\ncorrespondents state that the Applicant is a person of high ethical standards.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n\n5\nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant has over $50,000.00 in past due debts, which have\nbeen due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2001 and 2004.  However, it took him\nuntil 2006 to begin to pay off any of the past due indebtedness.  This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant was laid off from his job.  As a\nresult, he attempted a new career and invested in a franchise operation.  The business\nfailed.  The Applicant, in addition to losing his investment, used credit cards to make\nbusiness purchases.  Three years after the business has closed, there are two creditors\nwho the Applicant has made no payments to at all.  The other creditors are being paid\nvery slowly.  I cannot find, under these particular circumstances, that the Applicant has\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\n6\nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off some of his creditors.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is arguably applicable.  However, given the fact that he is\n$90,000 in debt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, professional person who has had some tough times.  However, by his\nown admission, the Applicant made some poor business decisions during the time he\nwas laid off.  He has begun to make payments on some of his past due debts, but he is\nat least two years away from being current on all of his debts. \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), this conduct is recent.  Given the Applicant\u2019s overall\ndebt load, I am not convinced that he has a proper understanding of how he got in these\ncircumstances.  Accordingly, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)), or that\nthe likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not  clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H.

On September 17, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nJoseph Testan granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a\ntimely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the Guideline J mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error,\nwe reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings:\nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor.  In August 1990, he was charged with\nselling cocaine.  He was sentenced to 5 years probation and a fine of $2500.00.\nIn 1993, he was charged with possession of a Drug Related Object.  He was fined $300.00.\nAlso in 1993, he was charged with Criminal Trespass and Simple Battery, for which he received a\n$300.00 fine and 12 months probation.  \nIn 1998, he was charged with DUI.  He was sentenced to 2 days in jail, a $655.00 fine, and\n12 months probation.  Later that year he was charged with Battery.  His sentence consisted of a\n$745.00 fine and 12 months probation.\nIn September 1999, Applicant was charged with Terroristic Threats and Acts and with\nObstruction of Officers.  The former charge was dropped.  Applicant was convicted of two counts\nof Obstruction and one count of Stalking.  He was fined $1000.00 and received three consecutive\nperiods of probation of 12 months each.\nIn addition to these six offenses, of which he was convicted, Applicant had numerous other\narrests for which the charges were dropped.  Those arrests, as alleged in the SOR, occurred between\n1991 and 2006, for such offenses as battery (multiple charges), possession of a firearm by a felon,\ncriminal trespass, and aggravated assault.   During 2002 he was also charged with a probation\nviolation. \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.31(a).  \n1\nDirective \u00b6 E2.31(e).  In his decision the Judge misidentifies this as subparagraph 31(d).  \n2\n3\nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Therefore,\nthese findings are not at issue in this appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn analyzing this case, the Judge concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish\nsecurity concerns under Guideline J, specifically Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CCDC)\n31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d  and CCDC 31(e), \u201cviolation of parole\n1\nor probation . . .\u201d   He stated, \u201c[t]he evidence establishes that Applicant was arrested and convicted\n2\nof various crimes on six occasions beginning in 1990 and ending in 1999.  Applicant\u2019s criminal\nconduct reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and suggests he cannot\n\nDecision at 3.  \n3\nDirective \u00b6 E2.32(c): \u201c[E]vidence that the person did not commit the offense.\u201d \n4\nDecision. at 3-4.  \n5\nSee ISCR Case No. 99-0119 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 1999).  \n6\nIn Item 3, Response to SOR, Applicant states that the charges involving possession of drug paraphernalia and\n7\npossession of a firearm were due to his having, on two separate occasions, been in a car in which these objects were\nfound.  As regards the first, Applicant does not explicitly deny that the contraband was his.  As regards the second, he\navers that the firearm was placed under the seat of the car by another passenger, but he does not explicitly state who\nowned the gun, nor does he deny the legal sufficiency of his conviction.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.32(a): \u201c[S]o much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\n8\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment . . .\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.32(d): \u201c[T]here is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\n9\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment\nrecord, or constructive community involvement . . .\u201d\n4\nbe relied upon to safeguard classified information.\u201d   In light of the Judge\u2019s application of Criminal\n3\nConduct Mitigating Condition (CCMC) 32(c),  the Board interprets the decision to mean that the\n4\nJudge found the Government to have met its burden of production as to all allegations rather than\nmerely those for which Applicant was convicted.  The legal effect of this was to shift the burden of\npersuasion to Applicant in establishing possible mitigating conditions.  \nThe gravamen of the Judge\u2019s favorable decision lies in his view that Applicant\u2019s dropped\ncharges point to factual innocence.  He stated, \u201cAlthough a quick glance at the SOR would create\nthe impression that [A]pplicant is completely unworthy of a security clearance, when the facts are\nreviewed, it is clear there is significant mitigation present.  First, more than half of charges alleged\nin the SOR were dismissed.  This strongly suggests that [A]pplicant had a problem with local law\nenforcement.  But even if he didn\u2019t have such a problem, the mere fact that charges were dismissed\non so many occasions strongly suggests that [A]pplicant did not engage in the conduct for which he\nwas charged.\u201d   The Board is not persuaded by this reasoning.  While it is reasonable to conclude\n5\nthat a man who has been arrested 17 times since 1990 had a problem with law enforcement, there\nis no evidence in the record to demonstrate that this problem originated with the police rather than\nwith Applicant\u2019s own conduct.  The fact that charges have been dropped does not in and of itself\nestablish that Applicant did not commit the alleged misconduct.   Under DOHA procedures, it is\n6\nApplicant\u2019s responsibility to present evidence to demonstrate that the security concerns presented\nby his conduct or circumstances have been mitigated.  In this case, Applicant\u2019s evidence is scant.\nIn his response to the SOR, he provided exculpatory responses for two of the allegations;  however,\n7\nfor most of them, he merely admitted that he was arrested and that the charges were dropped, but he\nprovided no explanation as to the why this was done, whether for factual innocence or for other\nreasons that do not rule out actual guilt.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had\nmet his burden of persuasion under CCMC 32(c) is not sustainable.\nFor similar reasons, the Board cannot uphold the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nmisconduct has been mitigated through attenuation  or rehabilitation.   As to the former, the Judge\n8\n9\n\nDecision at 4.\n10\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15: \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut,\n11\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate\nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nItem 3 at 3.  \n12\n5\nconcluded that \u201cthere is no credible evidence that [A]pplicant has committed any criminal act since\n1999. . .\u201d   However, this conclusion cannot logically be derived from the limited evidence supplied\n10\nby Applicant.  In addition to his response to the SOR, which did not address the facts underlying\nmost of the alleged offenses, Applicant provided some character references.  One of these is from\na former employer, who states that \u201cwhile under our employment [Applicant] made no attempt to\nconceal the facts\u201d about his misconduct, a comment that is scarcely exculpatory.  There is no other\nevidence addressing the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s criminal record.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s misconduct occurred so long ago that it does not now impugn his\nreliability is based upon an impermissible shifting to the Government of the burden of persuasion,\nwhich is error.   \n11\nApplicant did provide a greater quantum of evidence on the question of rehabilitation, insofar\nas he has demonstrated good job performance.  However, no favorable conclusion on this mitigating\ncondition can be reached without explaining why Applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct, the most recent\nincident of which is 2006, either did not occur or is of relatively minor significance when balanced\nagainst favorable evidence in the file.  As with CCMC 32(a), one of the criteria pertinent to this issue\nis that of passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity.  Applicant\u2019s failure to explain the\nbulk of the allegations against him or otherwise provide evidence to exculpate or mitigate the\nmisconduct renders a favorable decision under this mitigating condition unsustaintable.\nAs noted above, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s case raised CCDC 31(e), \u201cviolation of\nparole or probation . . .\u201d  In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated only that he admitted that he\nwas charged with a probation violation and that he \u201ccompleted [his] sentence successfully.\u201d   The\n12\nJudge appears not to have questioned the fact that Applicant did indeed violate the terms of a\npreviously imposed probation.  However, he concluded that this disqualifying condition was\nmitigated insofar as there was no record evidence showing that the underlying act constituted a\ncrime.   This conclusion is not totally consistent with the record evidence.  Item 5 is a report of\nApplicant\u2019s criminal record, which contains a reference to the probation violation.  There is nothing\nin the record, certainly nothing supplied by Applicant, to contradict the implication that an act\nincluded in an applicant\u2019s criminal history is criminal in nature.  In any event, whether the underlying\nact was criminal or not, a probation violation in 2002 certainly undermines the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant has shown successful rehabilitation in the years intervening between his 1999\nmisconduct and the date of the decision.  \nThe Board has considered the record as a whole.  Insofar as Applicant has admitted the many\narrests cited in the SOR and, in his response to the FORM, has provided no evidence in mitigation\nor extenuation save that described in Footnote 7, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable\nsecurity clearance decision is not sustainable.  We hold that his decision is arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law.\n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.     \nSigned: Jean E.

Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 15, 2007, and elected to have his case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's\nwritten case (FORM) on or about July 25, 2007. Applicant responded to the FORM on or about\nAugust 29, 2007. The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 37 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn or about August 1990, applicant was arrested and charged with selling cocaine. He was\nplaced on First Offender probation for five years and was fined $2,500.00. Applicant successfully\ncompleted his probation and paid the fine.\nIn June 1991, applicant was charged with Aggravated Assault. During the same month, he\nwas charged with Simple Battery. It\u2019s possible both charges arose from the same incident. Both\ncharges were dropped.\nIn August 1992, applicant was charged with Battery. During the same month, he was charged\nwith Aggravated Assault. It\u2019s possible both charges arose from the same incident. Both charges were\ndropped.\nIn 1993, applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a Drug Related Object. He\nwas convicted of the charge and fined $300.00.\nIn 1993, applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal Trespass and Simple Battery. He\nwas convicted of both charges, fined approximately $300.00, and placed on probation for 12 months.\nIn 1993, applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted\nFelon and Permitting Violator to Violate State Law. The charges were dismissed.\nIn August 1994, applicant was arrested and charged with Simple Battery. The charge was\ndismissed.\nIn December 1994, applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal Trespass, and on a\nseparate date was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault. The charges in both cases were\ndismissed.\n\n3\nIn March 1998, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was convicted of DUI or\na lesser charge, was sentenced to two days in jail, fined $655.00, and placed on probation for 12\nmonths.\nIn December 1998, applicant was arrested and charged with Battery. He was convicted of the\ncharge, fined $745.00, and placed on probation for 12 months.\nIn September 1999, applicant was arrested and charged with Terroristic Threats and Acts,\nand Obstruction of Officers, both felonies. The Terroristic Threats and Acts charge was dismissed,\nand the Obstruction of Officers charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. He was convicted of\nObstruction of Officers and Stalking and fined $1,000.00. The SOR alleges that applicant received\n12 months probation. In his response to the SOR, applicant volunteered the fact he was convicted\nof two counts of Obstruction of Officers and one count of Stalking, and was sentenced to 12 months\nof probation for each count, which ran consecutively, for a total of 36 months. This helps explain\nhow he was charged with a probation violation in 2002.\nIn October 1999, applicant was charged with Contempt of Court. The charge was dismissed.\nIn November 2002, applicant was arrested and charged with Battery. The charge was\ndismissed. Applicant admits that during the same month he was charged with a probation violation.\nIn March 2006, applicant was arrested and charged with Simple Battery. The charge was\ndismissed.\nIn response to the FORM, applicant submitted two character reference letters. The first was\nfrom a former coworker who was also applicant\u2019s manager for five and one-half years. She states\nthat applicant \u201cproved to be a reliable, dedicated, hardworking and honest individual,\u201d and she would\nrecommend applicant \u201cfor any position that requires secured access to sensitive or classified\ninformation.\u201d She concluded her letter by stating, \u201cWorking together for 5 \u00bd years has given me\nquite a bit of insight to [applicant\u2019s] professional and personal life and the opportunity to see\nfirsthand how he handles adversity, deals with challenge and manages different levels of stress.\nNothing I have seen would cause me to think that [applicant] would be unable [to] safeguard\ninformation or that he would misuse such information in a harmful or unlawful way.\u201d\nThe second letter is from the President and CEO of the defense contractor that has employed\napplicant since May 2005. He states that applicant has proven to be honest, reliable, and\nhardworking, and recommends applicant for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant was arrested and convicted of various crimes on six\noccasions beginning in 1990 and ending in 1999. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct reflects adversely on\nhis judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and suggests he cannot be relied upon to safeguard\nclassified information. Disqualifying Conditions 31a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and 31d. (violation of parole or probation) are applicable.\n\n Because there is no evidence in the record regarding the probation violation, I cannot\n1\ndetermine if the conduct causing the probation violation was criminal. And, it is not clear if a\nprobation violation, by itself, is a crime.\nPages 18 and 19.\n2\n4\nAlthough a quick glance at the SOR would create the impression that applicant is completely\nunworthy of a security clearance, when the facts are reviewed, it is clear there is significant\nmitigation present. First, more than half of charges alleged in the SOR were dismissed. This  strongly\nsuggests that applicant had a problem with local law enforcement. But even if he didn\u2019t have such\na problem, the mere fact the charges were dismissed on so many occasions strongly suggests that\napplicant did not engage in the conduct for which he was charged. Accordingly, Mitigating\nCondition 32c. (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) is applicable.\nSecond, except for perhaps a probation violation in 2002 (about five years ago),  there is no\n1\ncredible evidence that applicant has committed any criminal act since 1999 (about eight years ago).\nSince 1999, he has been employed with two companies that think very highly of him. Whether it is\nsimply applicant getting older and maturing, or his gainful employment, or a combination of the two,\nit appears that applicant has put his criminal ways behind him. He qualifies for Mitigating\nConditions 32a. (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and  32d. (there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement).\nBased on the foregoing, and after consideration of the general factors set forth in Enclosure\n2, Paragraph 2 of the Directive,  Guideline J is found for applicant.\n2\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nGUIDELINE  J: FOR THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has three children, ages 24, 23, and 19. He also has a 30-year-old stepdaughter.1 Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter was five years old when he married her mother. He was a frequent drug user, using marijuana and methamphetamine on a regular basis. He started sexually molesting the girl when she was about seven years old. The molestation continued until she was 13 years old, in 1992 or 1993. Applicant used methamphetamine on many of the occasions he molested his stepdaughter. In 1994, he and the girl had an argument after she would not follow his instructions, and he slapped her. She went and told her mother about the molestations. Applicant\u2019s wife reported the abuse to the police department.2 Applicant was charged with the felony offense of indecency with a child by sexual contact.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines D (Sexual Behavior), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non January 28, 2010, and reassigned to me on February 25, 2010. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on February 18, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nMarch 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nMarch 9, 2010. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit (AE) A, \nwhich was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non March 17, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer, or a predecessor company, since 1989. He is seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He attended college for several years but did not earn a degree. He \nwas married from 1972 until his divorce in 1976. He married again in 1984. He has \nthree children, ages 24, 23, and 19. He also has a 30-year-old stepdaughter.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter was five years old when he married her mother. He was \na frequent drug user, using marijuana and methamphetamine on a regular basis. He \nstarted sexually molesting the girl when she was about seven years old. The \nmolestation continued until she was 13 years old, in 1992 or 1993. Applicant used \nmethamphetamine on many of the occasions he molested his stepdaughter. In 1994, he \nand the girl had an argument after she would not follow his instructions, and he slapped \nher. She went and told her mother about the molestations. Applicant\u2019s wife reported the \nabuse to the police department.2  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with the felony offense of indecency with a child by sexual \ncontact. He obtained a deferred adjudication in which there was no adjudication of guilt, \nbut which carried probation for ten years, mandatory treatment, payment of fees, and \nregistration as a sex offender. Terms of his probation included no illegal drug use and \nno contact with children under the age of 18, including his own children. He also had to \nundergo regular polygraph examinations looking into probation violations. He had two \nviolations during the probation period. He asked his wife to give a Valentine\u2019s Day card \nto his stepdaughter in about 1998, and he had inadvertent contact with his sister\u2019s child \nin 2002.3 \n \n \nApplicant completed his counseling and probation in 2005. The discharge \nsummary from the sex offender treatment program stated: \n \nClient attended 523 sessions. Client cancelled/failed to attend 24 \nscheduled sessions. Client completed a psychological evaluation on 09-\n18-96. Client assumed full responsibility for the offense. The problem \nidentified in the treatment plan was deviant arousal and behavior. \nProgress in the area was moderate. Client modified his deviant sexual \narousal by successfully completing behavioral work. However, his most \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 16, 20-22; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 22-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 28-35, 45-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nrecent penile Plethysmograph of 01-08-05 indicates he again has elevated \ndeviant arousal to Female Teen Persuasive. Client maintained a failure \nrate of 4.4%. Participation in the program was good. The risk of \nreoccurrence of inappropriate sexual behavior is thought to be moderate \nas evidenced from his current elevation of deviant arousal to female teen. \nHowever, he has completed all of his treatment goals. He has completed a \nrelapse prevention plan and child safety/avoidance plan to assist him after \nprobation and for the rest of his life. His wife and sister who are his \nsupport system have been fully informed of the Relapse Prevention Plan \nand what their roles need to be to assist [Applicant]. \n \n[Applicant] passed his exit polygraph concerning whether he had any \ndeviant thoughts, arousal, or fantasies about any minors for the past year \nor if he has violated any supervision or treatment rules. He answered no \nand the polygraph showed No Deception. [Applicant] has been informed \nthat he is eligible to participate in After Care at [counseling center] on an \nas needed basis. It was further recommended that he and his family \nparticipate in family therapy to assist them in their reunification process.4 \n \n \nApplicant has not received counseling since he was discharged from the sex \noffender treatment program in 2005. The counselor recommended continued \ncounseling, but Applicant believes it is not necessary, stating that counseling teaches \npeople that eventually they must \u201ctake responsibility for [their] own actions.\u201d He also \nindicated that the counselors have to earn a profit. He did not agree with the discharge \nsummary about the risk of reoccurrence. He stated that he stopped using drugs on a \nregular basis in the late 1980s, and he has not used any illegal drugs since his arrest in \n1995. He reunited with his wife and family after his probation ended in 2005. He and his \nstepdaughter have reconciled. She has a ten-year-old son. She and her son visit \nApplicant and his wife. Applicant continues to be a registered sex offender, and he \nnotifies other states when he travels. His friends and family are aware of his actions and \nstatus. His information as a sex offender is available over the internet. He notified his \nsupervisor in 1995 of his arrest. His co-workers are aware of his status. There is no \nevidence that he has molested anyone other than his stepdaughter. Applicant testified \nthat he has changed his behavior and he has \u201cthe tools and know-how\u201d to avoid ever \ncommitting a similar offense.5 He testified: \n \nI cannot put myself in any situation where it might be misconstrued that I \nmight be in danger of molesting anybody. I can go - - when I go to the \nstore, I never even go to the toy department, I never go to movies alone. I \ndon\u2019t go to parks. I\u2019ve changed my behavior significantly. I\u2019ve dumped any \nfriends that I know that engage in any drugs.6 \n                                                          \n4 AE A. \n \n5 Tr. at 22-24, 35-44, 48-50, 54-56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-38. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which can \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(a) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \n \nApplicant sexually molested his stepdaughter for about six years. All of the above \ndisqualifying conditions are established.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was treated in the sex offender program at a \ncounseling center from 1996 to 2005. Counseling and treatment are matters in \nmitigation. The allegation does not raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant is a registered sex offender. That is true, but it \ndoes not state any sexual behavior that is not already alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. I conclude \nSOR \u00b6 1.c for Applicant.  \nConditions that could mitigate Sexual Behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.  \n \nApplicant started sexually molesting his stepdaughter when she was seven years \nold. The molestation continued until she was about 13 years old. She is now 30 years \nold, so it has been about 16 or 17 years since the molestations occurred. That is a long \ntime ago. However, for AG \u00b6 14(b) to be applicable, there must also be a finding that the \nsexual behavior is unlikely to recur and that it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant is a registered sex offender. He \nreceived treatment for ten years. His counselor recommended continued counseling, \nbut he declined. His counselor\u2019s discharge summary does not inspire confidence, noting \n\u201c[t]he risk of reoccurrence of inappropriate sexual behavior is thought to be moderate as \nevidenced from his current elevation of deviant arousal to female teen.\u201d Despite the \npassage of time, I am unable to make a determination that the behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. It continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) is not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant stated that his arrest is common knowledge. That has lessened, but not \neliminated, his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6 14(c) is partially \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions were so egregious that Sexual Behavior concerns remain \ndespite the presence of some mitigation.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \n\n \n7 \n \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s crimes led to probation for ten years and registration as a sex \noffender. That conduct created a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable for the same rationale discussed under the Sexual \nBehavior analysis. Applicant received counselling as a requirement of his probation. \nHowever, I cannot make an affirmative finding that the behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6 17(d) is partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s actions are common knowledge, which has \nlessened his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is partially \napplicable.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that Personal Conduct concerns are still present despite the \npresence of some mitigation.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant committed serious crimes when he repeatedly sexually molested his \nstepdaughter. Both of the above disqualifying conditions are established.  \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not applicable for the same rationale discussed under the Sexual \nBehavior analysis. There is evidence of rehabilitation, warranting the application of AG \u00b6 \n32(d). However, based upon his counselor\u2019s opinion that the risk of reoccurrence of \ninappropriate sexual behavior was \u201cmoderate,\u201d Applicant\u2019s evidence of rehabilitation is \ninsufficient to counter the security concerns raised by his criminal actions.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n9 \n \nunder Guideline, D, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant sexually molested his stepdaughter from the time she was seven years \nold until she was thirteen. I considered Applicant\u2019s long and stable work history. I also \nconsidered the length of time since his last offense. However, he is a registered sex \noffender, and his counselor noted that the risk of reoccurrence of inappropriate sexual \nbehavior is moderate. That is an unacceptable risk. I continue to have significant \nconcerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Sexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, and Criminal \nConduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Also alleged is a series of Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, the most recent of which was dismissed in 2005, which she does not dispute. And the SOR alleges a 2004\u20132005 event when Applicant pleaded no contest to a charge of deposit-account fraud, which she does not dispute. In addition to her admissions, the following facts are established. Applicant is a 37-year-old records management coordinator. She has worked for her current employer since September 2005. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time (Exhibits 1 and 2). Applicant has never married. She has three children, ages 17, 12, and 3.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, which are ongoing. She has done\nlittle to demonstrate that she will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke her eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on July 11, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn July 18, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on October 2, 2007, and the transcript was received on October 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 25 delinquent debts for about $31,000 in total. Applicant\nadmits indebtedness of about $27,000. Also alleged is a series of Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, the\nmost recent of which was dismissed in 2005, which she does not dispute. And the SOR alleges a\n2004\u20132005 event when Applicant pleaded no contest to a charge of deposit-account fraud, which she\ndoes not dispute. In addition to her admissions, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old records management coordinator. She has worked for her current\nemployer since September 2005. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time\n(Exhibits 1 and 2). \nApplicant has never married. She has three children, ages 17, 12, and 3. The 17-year-old\nchild receives child support in the amount of $74 every two weeks. The other two children do not\nreceive child support from their fathers. In addition to the children, Applicant\u2019s fiancee lives with\nApplicant. Her fiancee is currently seeking employment. \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. The history is established by an\nOctober 2005 credit report and a February 2007 credit report (Exhibits 7 and 8), which form the basis\nfor the debts in the SOR. Applicant has been unable to repay any of the creditors in the SOR or\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n3\notherwise resolve her indebtedness. She believes that she will be able to take some action in about\ntwo years after paying off her current car loan. \nIn March 2006, she met with a consumer credit counseling service (Exhibit 6). They\nestimated her indebtedness at $11,470 for 13 creditors with a payout forecast of $351 per month.\nApplicant did not pursue the repayment plan as she was unable to afford the monthly payment. \nIn addition to her indebtedness, Applicant has a history of bankruptcy court proceedings\n(Exhibits 3, 4, and 5). It started with a Chapter 13 petition in 1992. It appears this petition was\nmodified a couple of times until it was finalized in 1995. Applicant then made the required\ninstallment payments (amount unknown). The case was closed, and the court issued a discharge\norder in 1999. \nThe next bankruptcy proceeding began in 2004 when Applicant filed a Chapter 13 petition\nin an effort to prevent foreclosure on her home. She had been laid off from her job in 2004 and was\ntrying to save her house. The 2004 Chapter 13 petition and a subsequent 2005 Chapter 13 petition\nboth ended in dismissal when Applicant did not have sufficient funds to pursue the cases.\nApplicant\u2019s house was foreclosed in 2005. \nIn 2004, Applicant was charged with the offense of deposit-account fraud. She pleaded no\ncontest and was fined. She did not pay the fine in a timely fashion resulting in her arrest in 2005. She\nserved about two days in jail and paid the fine.\nConcerning her overall financial situation, Applicant\u2019s gross income in 2006 was about\n$30,000. She is the sole financial provider in her household. She had about $100 in a checking\naccount the day of the hearing. Since starting her current job, Applicant has been participating in the\ncompany 401(k) retirement plan at the 1% level. Otherwise, she has no financial assets.\n \nApplicant did not provide any documentary information about the debts in the SOR.\nLikewise, other than her own testimony, she did not present any witnesses, on paper or in person,\nin support of her application for a security clearance. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n4\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\n\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n DC 4 is \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income\n18\ntax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional breaches of trust.\u201d\n5\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n15\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHer history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability to satisfy debts16\nand a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record\n17\nevidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. In addition, her no\ncontest plea to deposit-account fraud falls with the meaning of a deceptive or illegal financial\npractice under the guideline.   \n18\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in\nher favor. Although unemployed in 2004, her financial problems are longstanding and cannot be\ntraced solely to that event. Applicant presented little in the way of favorable information, and her\ngood intentions and future plans are not sufficient evidence to overcome the security concern raised\nby the government\u2019s evidence. Indeed, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic approach for resolving\nher delinquent debts; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of that approach; and (3) a\nmeasurable improvement to her situation. At this point, it is likely that her history of financial\nproblems will continue. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013ee:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n6\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 48-year-old manager of operations for a defense contractor. He was born and educated in a U.S., in a town near the Canadian border. He served in the U.S. Navy from December 1980 to December 1987. In 1983, while in the Navy and stationed in Hawaii, he married a Canadian citizen. He received a clearance in June 1991, while stationed aboard a U.S. submarine. 3 After Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he found few job opportunities in the U.S. He searched for jobs in Canada, found a good job, and moved to Canada in 1988, to work for a Canadian company (Tr. 34). From August 2000 to January 2001, he worked in the U.S. for a branch of the Canadian company. He returned to Canada when his employer offered him a promotion and a raise (Tr. 35-36). While they lived in Canada, his wife was employed, first as a flight attendant and later as a dental assistant (Tr. 80-81). Applicant registered his son in two Canadian educational savings funds in October and November 1998. He contributed a total of about $16,000 (Canadian) to the funds, and the funds are now worth about $26,000, including Canada savings grants of about $2,400 (AX N).

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on August 16, \n2005.  On August 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny \nhis application, citing security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 27, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 31, 2007. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on November 2, \n2007, and reassigned to me on December 3, 2007, based on workload. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on December 14, 2007; and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nJanuary 15, 2008. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of one \nwitness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through P, which were admitted \nwithout objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February \n8, 2008 to enable him to submit additional evidence.  Applicant timely submitted AX Q, \nR and S, and they were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to \nAX Q, R, and S is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) II.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 25, 2008. The record closed on February 8, \n2008.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 1.d, alleging \nApplicant received healthcare benefits from the Canadian government, and \u00b6 1.e, \nalleging Applicant voted in a Canadian national referendum.  Applicant did not object to \nthe amendments, and I granted the motion to amend (Tr. 106-09).  The motion was \nreduced to writing and is attached to the record as HX III. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nI directed Department Counsel to submit evidence or a request to take \nadministrative notice of relevant facts pertaining to Canada, the country at issue in the \nSOR (Tr. 110-11).  Department Counsel and Applicant submitted a joint request for \nadministrative notice, attached to the record as HX I. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out below.  \n \nAuthentication of a Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered a personal subject interview extracted from a report \nof investigation (GX 4), without an authenticating witness as required by the Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20.  I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he affirmatively \nwaived it (Tr. 29-30). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations. His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old manager of operations for a defense contractor.  He \nwas born and educated in a U.S., in a town near the Canadian border.  He served in the \nU.S. Navy from December 1980 to December 1987.  In 1983, while in the Navy and \nstationed in Hawaii, he married a Canadian citizen.  He received a clearance in June \n1991, while stationed aboard a U.S. submarine.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he found few job opportunities in \nthe U.S.  He searched for jobs in Canada, found a good job, and moved to Canada in \n1988, to work for a Canadian company (Tr. 34).  From August 2000 to January 2001, he \nworked in the U.S. for a branch of the Canadian company. He returned to Canada when \nhis employer offered him a promotion and a raise (Tr. 35-36). While they lived in \nCanada, his wife was employed, first as a flight attendant and later as a dental assistant \n(Tr. 80-81). \n \nApplicant registered his son in two Canadian educational savings funds in \nOctober and November 1998.  He contributed a total of about $16,000 (Canadian) to \nthe funds, and the funds are now worth about $26,000, including Canada savings grants \nof about $2,400 (AX N).  His son was born in the U.S., is a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen, \nand is in his third year of college in Canada.  His son registered for the U.S. draft when \nhe became 18 years old (AX M). \n \nFrom 1988 to 1999, Applicant filed annual U.S. federal income tax returns (AX \nS).  He did not vote in any U.S. elections during that period (Tr. 82). He did not vote in \nCanadian elections, except for one referendum in 2000 regarding the use of the French \nlanguage in Quebec.  He was unhappy with the repeated efforts of French Canadians \n\u201cto go through their separation issue and worry about the language rights and all that,\u201d \nand he decided to vote in the referendum to voice his anti-separatist opinion on the \nissue.  (Tr. 65-66).   \n \nA Canadian residency document was attached to Applicant\u2019s U.S. passport to \nexplain to Canadian immigration authorities why a Canadian resident was entering the \ncountry on a U.S. passport (AX R).  As a non-citizen resident, he was entitled to medical \ncare in Canadian government health facilities, and he used it on several occasions \nbefore and after he became a citizen (Tr. 67, 88). \n \nApplicant was encouraged by his supervisors to obtain Canadian citizenship \nbecause his company was performing defense contracts for both the U.S. and Canada. \nHe held a NATO clearance, but he was not permitted access to some Canadian \ndocuments because he was not a citizen (Tr. 54-55). He obtained Canadian citizenship \nin June 1999 and a Canadian passport shortly thereafter, but he retained his U.S. \ncitizenship and passport.  Before accepting Canadian citizenship, he verified with the \nU.S. consulate that he could become dual citizen and would not lose his U.S. citizenship \n(Tr. 33, 93). He believed he would remain in Canada until he retired, but he intended to \nreturn to the U.S. after retirement, because all his family is in the U.S. (Tr. 36, 84-85)). \n \nApplicant used his Canadian passport to travel to Cuba in the summer of 2004.  \nHe testified he knew he could not travel to Cuba using his U.S. passport, but \u201call the \nCanadians were going there,\u201d and he did not know it was illegal (Tr. 77-78; GX 5).  He \nstayed in a popular and inexpensive resort (GX 4 at 2). He apparently used his \nCanadian passport for other foreign travel to the Dominican Republic, France, and the \nU.K., because there are no entry stamps in his U.S. passport for that travel (GX 2).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAs a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Applicant\u2019s company \nexperienced a downturn, and he was laid off from his job in Canada in February 2005. \nHe was offered a job in the U.S. in May 2005.  He moved to an apartment in the U.S., \nand his wife remained in Canada pending action on her request to immigrate to the U.S. \nHe kept his Canadian passport \u201cto make sure [he] made the correct career choice.\u201d (GX \n3 at 3).  His Canadian passport was lost during the move from Canada to the U.S. It \nexpired in 2005.   \n \nApplicant sold his home in Canada in October 2005 (AX J), and purchased a \nhome in the U.S. (AX C, D and E).  His wife is now a permanent U.S. resident and lives \nwith him.  She intends to become a U.S. citizen.   \n \nApplicant has various accounts totaling about $51,000 with a bank in the U.S. \n(AX G), and he has about $12,000 in his retirement account with his current employer.  \nHe and his wife have investment portfolios in the U.S. worth about $243,000 (AX O and \nP).   \n \nApplicant has a retirement account in Canada worth about $175,000 in Canadian \ndollars that he has been unable to transfer without adverse tax consequences (GX 4 at \n1; AX I).  While the laws of the U.S. and Canada permit an exemption from the adverse \ntax consequences, Applicant\u2019s state of residence is not among the twenty states in the \nU.S. that have allowed this exemption. Without the exemption, he can redeem his funds \nin his account but cannot transfer them (AX I).   \n \nApplicant testified he is willing to renounce his Canadian citizenship if it would not \njeopardize his Canadian retirement account (Tr. 70-71).  His Canadian financial advisor \nexplained to him that the adverse tax consequences of transferring his retirement \naccount to the U.S. are caused by the laws of the state where he now resides in the \nU.S., and not by national policies of the U.S. or Canada (AX I).  Notwithstanding this \nadvice from his financial advisor, Applicant expressed uncertainty at the hearing about \nthe financial consequences of renouncing his Canadian citizenship. \n \nApplicant\u2019s last two annual performance evaluations, covering January 2006 \nthough December 2007, described him as an \u201cexceptional contributor,\u201d the highest \nrating (Tr. 103).  He received an \u201cexcellence award\u201d in January 2007 for his dedication, \nexpertise, and leadership on several projects for the U.S. armed forces (AX A).  \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, who has known him since May 2005, described \nApplicant as honest, of high integrity, very dependable, and trustworthy (Tr. 98). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, four brothers, and a sister are citizens and residents of the \nU.S. (Tr. 58, 60). His mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Canada and lives in a \nnursing home (Tr. 60). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was never employed outside the home \nafter she was married (Tr. 62).  His father-in-law is deceased (Tr. 60).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has two brothers and one sister in Canada (Tr. 71).  One brother \nis a maintenance worker at a hospital (Tr. 71).  The other works for the Canadian Space \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAgency (Tr. 72).  The sister is a substitute teacher in a public school (Tr. 73).  Although \nApplicant does not have much contact with his in-laws, he and his wife travel to Canada \nfor a family gathering each Thanksgiving, and they gather at Applicant\u2019s home for \nChristmas (Tr. 73). \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Canada.  Canada is \na highly developed, stable democracy.  The Canadian government generally respects \nthe rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective redress for individual \ninstances of abuse. The relationship between the U.S. and Canada is probably the \nclosest and most extensive in the world, extending to bilateral trade, law enforcement, \nenvironmental cooperation, and people-to-people contact.  U.S. defense arrangements \nwith Canada are more extensive than with any other country.  Although Canada has at \ntimes pursued policies at odds with the U.S., Canada views good relationships with the \nU.S. as critical and looks to the U.S. as a partner in promoting democracy and good \ngovernment throughout the world. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant acquired Canadian citizenship and a Canadian \npassport even though he was a native-born U.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he has a \nCanadian retirement account worth about $175,000 and maintains his Canadian \ncitizenship to protect it (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and he used his Canadian passport to travel to \nCuba (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n  \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 9 as follows: \n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d   \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n \n \nA security concern may be raised by the \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \n\n \n7 \n \n \nto possession of a current foreign passport (AG \u00b6 10(a)(1)); accepting educational, \nmedical, retirement, social welfare, or other benefits from a foreign country (AG \n10(a)(2)); using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another \ncountry (AG \u00b6 10(a)(5)); or voting in a foreign election (AG \u00b6 10(a)(7)). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) is not raised because Applicant does not possess a \u201ccurrent \nforeign passport,\u201d it having expired in 2005. AG \u00b6 10(a)(2) is not raised because his \nreceipt of medical care was based on residence and not on citizenship.  AG \u00b6 10(a)(5) \nis not raised, because the adverse tax consequences resulting from transfer of his \nretirement account to the U.S. are not based on Canadian law but on the state tax law \nof his current residence in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s voting in a referendum in Canada raises \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(7).   \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201caction to acquire . . . a foreign \ncitizenship by an American citizen.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(b).  Applicant\u2019s application for and receipt \nof Canadian citizenship raises this disqualifying condition.  His use of his Canadian \npassport for foreign travel while retaining his U.S. passport does not fall within an \nenumerated disqualifying condition.  However, it raises a security concern because it \nwas an exercise of Canadian citizenship. \n \n \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cperforming or attempting to \nperform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in conflict with the national security interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n10(c).  This disqualifying condition is not established by Applicant\u2019s work in support of \nthe Canadian armed forces, because there is no indication his work was \u201cin conflict with \nthe national security interest.\u201d  To the contrary, the relationship between the U.S. and \nCanada on military matters is extensive and characterized by cooperation and joint \naction rather than competition. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise several \ndisqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  This mitigating \ncondition is not established, because Applicant has qualified his willingness to renounce \nCanadian citizenship on being able to transfer his retirement account to the U.S. without \nadverse consequences.  His concern does not appear justified in light of the \nexplanations provided by his financial advisor. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be \nmitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  Applicant\u2019s passport has expired, and \nit was lost during his move to the U.S. in the summer of 2005.  He does not intend to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrenew it.  I conclude that the purpose of AG \u00b6 11(e) is satisfied in this case, because its \nexpiration and loss three years ago are functionally equivalent to its destruction. \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Canada (SOR \u00b6 2.a); his son \nis a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen attending college in Canada (SOR \u00b6 2.b); his mother-in-\nlaw is a citizen and resident of Canada (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and he resided and worked in \nCanada from 1988 to September 2000 and from January 2001 to May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d).  The SOR also cross-alleges the conduct under Guideline C as a concern under \nGuideline B (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n \nThe concern under this Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  \nFirst, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Third, a security \nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, with whom he lives, is a Canadian citizen.  His son, a dual \ncitizen, resides in Canada.  His mother-in-law, two brothers-in-law, and his sister-in-law \nare citizens and residents of Canada.  A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a \nperson has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the \nperson's spouse.@  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002).  Applicant has only occasional contact with his in-laws, but he \nparticipates regularly in the family gatherings at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The \npresumption of ties of affection for or obligation to his in-laws has not been rebutted. I \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) are raised by Applicant\u2019s family connections to \nCanada. \n \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e).  Applicant\u2019s Canadian retirement account raises AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nSince the evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), (d), and (e), the burden is \non Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate the facts.  Security concerns under \nthis guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the relationships with \nforeign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or \nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family \ntie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nAmong the family members with Canadian connections, only one brother is \nemployed by the Canadian government in an industry where protection of information is \nimportant.  The nature of Canada\u2019s government is a key factor in this case.  The close \nand cooperative relations between Canada and the U.S., including extensive military \ncooperation and exchanges, the similarities between the two countries with respect to \ngovernment and protection of human rights, and the absence of Canadian economic or \nmilitary intelligence activities directed at the U.S. make the risk of coercion, persuasion \nor duress almost nil.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(a) is established. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b). \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Canada were economic, not based on politics or ideology.  He \ninitially went to Canada because he could not find work in the U.S. but was offered a \nposition in Canada.  His job search in Canada was understandable, because he grew \nup near the Canadian border and his wife was Canadian.  He returned to the U.S. to \nmanage a facility for his Canadian employer, but returned to Canada when he was \noffered a promotion and a raise.  He did not become a Canadian citizen until he had \nworked and lived in Canada for 11 years.  He did so because his supervisors told him it \nwould be advantageous for his career advancement.  He accepted Canadian citizenship \nonly after ascertaining that it would not jeopardize his U.S. citizenship. He intended to \nremain in Canada until he retired, and then return to the U.S. In anticipation of \nremaining in Canada until retirement, he enrolled his son in a Canadian education fund.  \nHis plan was derailed when he was laid off.  He then returned to the U.S. and disposed \nof or transferred virtually all his assets except his Canadian retirement account.   \n \nIn contrast to his economic ties to Canada, Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are family-\nbased.  His parents, four brothers, and one sister all are U.S. citizens and residents.  \nHis wife is a permanent U.S. resident and intends to become a U.S. citizen.  He grew up \nin the U.S., and always intended to return when his career with his Canadian employer \nended.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nvalue or routine nature of the foreign . . . property interests is such that [it is] unlikely to \nresult in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or \npressure the individual.  AG \u00b6 8(f).  This mitigating condition is not established, because \nthe funds in Applicant\u2019s Canadian retirement fund are substantial and sufficient to make \nhim reluctant to renounce his Canadian citizenship.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s case is unusual, because he always has been a U.S. citizen.  He \nserved honorably in the U.S. Navy for eight years and held a clearance in the Navy.  He \nmet and married his Canadian wife while in the Navy.  He sought employment in the \nU.S. after he was discharged from the Navy, but looked to Canada when he could not \nfind employment in the U.S.  He became a Canadian citizen only after his supervisors \ntold him it would be helpful for his career advancement, and after satisfying himself it \nwould not jeopardize his U.S. citizenship.  When his Canadian employment ended, he \nreturned to the U.S., where his parents and all his siblings reside.  His attraction to \nCanada was purely economic, not political, cultural, or based on ideology.  To the \ncontrary, he expressed some distaste for Canadian culture and politics.   \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C and \nB, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference and foreign \ninfluence. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He seeks a security clearance for his duties. The available record does not reflect that he has held a clearance. Applicant has been employed in a succession of blue collar jobs since January 1999.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) on March 2,\n2006. On December 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 19, 2008, and requested a\ndecision based on the record without a hearing. On February 28, 2008, the government\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6).\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within\n30 days of receipt. Applicant submitted no response by the April 3, 2008, deadline. On\nMay 2, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nMay 20, 2008\n\n2\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based\nupon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR\nallegations (Item 2), eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed\nalcohol at times to excess and intoxication from at least 2003 to at least May 2007\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he was terminated from a job in about May 2003 for having alcohol in\nhis system at work (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he was fired from his next employment in\nFebruary 2005 for reporting to work with alcohol on his breath (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he has\noperated his vehicle after drinking and while still feeling the effects of alcohol (SOR \u00b6\n1.d); and that he realizes his consumption of alcohol is a problem (SOR \u00b6 1.e).\nApplicant admitted the allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.e. After reviewing the\navailable evidence, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 55-year-old painter, who has worked for his present employer\nsince April 2005 (Item 4). He seeks a security clearance for his duties. The available\nrecord does not reflect that he has held a clearance.\nApplicant has been employed in a succession of blue collar jobs since January\n1999. He worked as a forklift operator from January 1999 to June 2001 and as a painter\nuntil February 2002. After only a month as a stocker for a discount retailer, he went to\nwork as a laborer on the evening shift for the local public service authority in March\n2002 (Item 4).\n      Before reporting to work one day in May 2003, Applicant consumed alcohol\n(reportedly three beers) while having his lunch at home. On his arrival at work later that\nday, his supervisor smelled alcohol on his breath. Applicant took a breathalyzer required\nby his employer that confirmed the presence of alcohol in his system. He was\nterminated immediately for violating company policy (Item 5).\nAfter a couple of months working as a forklift operator, Applicant was hired as a\npainter in July 2003. There is no evidence that his alcohol use caused him a problem at\nwork until late February 2005. The evening before he was scheduled to report for a\nsafety and orientation class given by a defense contractor, Applicant consumed 10 to 15\nbeers at a bar over three or four hours while waiting for and then playing billiards. When\nhe left the bar at around 1330 hours, he felt a \u201cbuzz\u201d from the beer, but felt he was in\ncondition to drive. On his arrival home at around 1345 hours, he went to bed.  At around\n0645 hours, Applicant arrived at a defense contractor facility where he was scheduled to\nattend an orientation and safety class. He was called out of the class because a person\nbelieved to be in the employ of the defense contractor had smelled alcohol on his\nbreath. Applicant was terminated later that day by his employer (Item 5, Item 6).\nApplicant was unemployed until April 2005 when he started with his present\nemployer (Item 4). On March 2, 2006, Applicant completed a SF 86. He reported that he\n\n3\nhad been fired from his previous job in February 2005 for having alcohol on his breath.\nHe did not disclose that he had been involuntarily terminated from another employer two\nyears earlier even though his termination was within the seven-year scope of the\nemployment record inquiry (\u201c22-LAST 7 YRS, FIRED, QUIT, OR LEFT/UNFAVORABLE\nCIRCUMSTANCES?\u201d).\nOn or about May 12, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator about the circumstances under which he was\nterminated from his job in February 2005. Applicant told the investigator that he had\nconsumed 10 to 15 beers until about 0130 hours before reporting for the orientation\nclass at around 0630. He admitted that he had been terminated for having alcohol on\nhis breath. In response to whether alcohol was a problem for him, Applicant volunteered\nthat he had been fired from a job in 2002 or 2003 after a breathalyzer test at work\nconfirmed the presence of alcohol in his system. Applicant added that he realized his\ndrinking was a problem, but he denied it was a major one. He admitted that he drank to\nfeel mellow, to unwind, and take the edge off after work. Applicant expressed his intent\nto continue to drink, and described his current consumption as three to four beers at\nhome, four to five nights a week (Item 5). On May 24, 2007, Applicant provided a written\naffidavit in which he acknowledged he had consumed 10 to 15 beers into the early\nhours of the morning that he had to attend the orientation class at a defense contractor\nsite, and he was terminated from his job later that day in February 2005 for having\nalcohol on his breath (Item 6).\nIn October 2007, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the investigator\u2019s\nreport of his interview on May 12, 2007, and asked whether the information was\naccurate. On October 10, 2007, Applicant indicated he did not recall telling the\ninvestigator that he had a blood alcohol content of .04% when he was terminated from\nhis position with the public service authority (Item 5).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set out\nin AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and untrustworthiness.\u201d The  record before me for review contains\nlittle detail about Applicant\u2019s consumption in terms of frequency or quantity. What is\nknown is that Applicant was fired from his job in about May 2003 when he reported for\nwork with alcohol in his system from drinking beer at lunchtime. He drove his vehicle\nhome from a bar in February 2005 after drinking 10 to 15 beers into the early hours of\nthe morning and was fired from his job for reporting for an orientation session with\nalcohol on his breath about six hours later. As of May 2007, he was drinking three or\nfour beers at a sitting, four to five nights a week, and he intended to continue to drink\nalcohol. He acknowledged in May 2007 that his drinking is a problem, but not a major\none.\n\n5\nAG \u00b6 22(b) (\u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty\nin an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d) applies. There is no\nevidence that Applicant was intoxicated when he reported to work in May 2003, but he\ndoes not dispute that he was terminated for having alcohol in his system on that\noccasion. He also allowed alcohol to negatively impact his judgment in February 2005.\nKnowing that he had to attend an orientation at a defense contractor site the next day,\nhe drank to such excess that he was not allowed to complete the session. The incidents\nwere viewed as serious by his respective employers, who terminated his employment\nwithin hours. Moreover, although there is no evidence he has ever been arrested for\ndrunk driving, he admits he felt \u201cbuzzed\u201d after drinking the 10 to 15 beers in February\n2005, not only when he drove home from the bar but also when he awoke at around\n0400 hours. AG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent\u201d) also applies.\nNone of the Guideline G mitigating conditions apply. While there is no evidence\nthat alcohol has impacted his judgment in his current job, I am unable to conclude that\n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on [his]\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d (AG \u00b6 23(a)). He admitted in May\n2007 that his drinking is a problem, yet he was still consuming three or four beers at\nhome, four to five nights a week. He did not indicate one way or the other whether he\nwas still drinking outside of the home, such as when playing billiards at a bar as he had\nin February 2005 or in other situations. But he also showed no inclination to change his\nbehavior. He indicated he intended to continue to drink and did not intend to seek\ncounseling. When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied that his alcohol consumption\nwas a problem, but he offered no evidence of a favorable change in his drinking habits.\nUnder the circumstances, AG \u00b6 23(b) (\u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\u201d) does not apply. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and 23(d)\nrequire the individual undergo treatment, which Applicant has no intention of doing.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\n\n6\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has lost two jobs due to\nhis drinking. Reporting to work while under the influence of alcohol is clearly\nincompatible with the fiduciary obligations that come with classified access. Applicant\nhas made no effort to show that he has appreciably changed his drinking behavior.\nGiven his expressed enjoyment of drinking (\u201che likes to drink to feel mellow, unwind and\ntake the edge off after work,\u201d Item 5), his intent to continue drinking as he had been,\nand denial of any intent to seek counseling, the risk of future alcohol abuse cannot be\nsafely ruled out.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n                             \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information must be\ngranted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 4, 2004.\nOn September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 18, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 10, 2007, and requested a hearing before\nApril 7, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated November 10, 2007.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Application (SF-86), dated April 19, 2004) at 1-2; AE A (letter, dated\n2\nMarch 3, 2008); AE B (Undated letter); Tr. 26, 48-49.\n2\nan Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request in November 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 30, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on January 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 12,\n2008, and amended notice of hearing on March 4, 2008. I convened the hearing on\nMarch 5, 2008, the rescheduled date. The government offered eight exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 8, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\nand one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted six exhibits (AE) A through F,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 14, 2008. I held the record open until March 19,\n2008, to submit additional matters.  On March 19, 2008, he submitted four exhibits,\nwhich are marked as AE G-J, and admitted into evidence without objection. The record\nclosed on March 19, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received notice of a change in the hearing\ndate by telephone on March 3, 2008. (Tr. 8-9.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6\nE3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively\nwaived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 10, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b, of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the\nremaining factual allegations in the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  At the hearing, the\n1\ngovernment agreed that SOR allegations 1.d and 1.g are the same debt. (Tr. 27.)\nApplicant, who is 45 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na project engineer in information technology (IT) work.

Two managers from his employer recommended him for a clearance.\nBoth describe him as trustworthy, honest, highly competent, and a man of integrity.

He was unable to find steady\nemployment as a nuclear engineer. His wife worked, but did not earn income sufficient\nto meet all the family financial needs. During this period of time, he incurred unpaid\nfederal tax debt. He lacked the funds for several years to pay his tax bill. He also\nincurred unpaid debts for living expenses.3\nIn 1997, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The bankruptcy\ncourt dismissed his petition when he did not make the payments developed under his\nrepayment plan. He stated that the monthly payments were too high because of the\nvolume of debt. (Tr. 34.)\nIn 2000, on the advice of his attorney, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under\nChapter 7. The bankruptcy court discharged all his debts, which he believed included\nhis back federal taxes and state debt. He now knows he was incorrect in his belief. (Tr.\n35-36.)\nApplicant\u2019s current gross monthly salary is $5,950 and his net monthly income is\n$3,696. His monthly expenses total $3,070, leaving excess monthly income of $626. He\ncurrently meets his family\u2019s financial needs on a monthly basis.4\n \nApplicant contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) when he learned that the\nIRS intended to levy his salary to recover the back taxes. He developed a repayment\nplan with the IRS, contingent upon his filing his 2005 and 2006 tax returns. He filed the\nreturns as required and began making a monthly payment of $380 in January 2008. He\nhas made three payments through March 2008, as required. He estimates it will take\nhim five years to repay his federal tax debt, which includes the taxes he owed from the\n2005 and 2006 tax years. He states that he did not file his later taxes because he owed\na total of $2,000 and did not have the money to pay these taxes. His monthly IRS\npayment is included as part of his monthly expenses. He recently changed his federal\ntax withholding from 4 to 2 to eliminate future federal tax issues.          \n5\nApplicant incurred a state debt when he was overpaid unemployment benefits\nover 20 years ago. He repaid some of this debt. In 1993, the State filed a personal lien\nfor this debt. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he had contacted the State about\nrepayment of this debt, which he incorrectly believed related to unpaid state taxes.\nSince the hearing, he reached an agreement with the State and paid the lien in full.6\n\nGE 5, supra note 3, at 6, 7, 8; GE 5, supra note 3, at 5, 6, 8; AE C (Letter, dated March 4, 2008); AE D\n7\n(Letter, dated April 2, 2003 and credit report page); Tr. 43, 50-52.\n4\nThe SOR lists two other unpaid debts. Applicant paid the credit card debt\nidentified in allegation 1.e through a settlement in April 2003. He also paid the debt\nidentified in allegation 1.f in July 2004. He has no other debts. His most recent credit\nreport reflects that he is current in his bills. Applicant received no formal credit\ncounseling, but friends and family provided guidance on how to improve his financial\nstatus. Applicant ignored his tax issues out of fear of working with the tax agencies. He\nfound it easy to work with the agencies on resolving his tax issues. He feels good about\nhis current financial situation.7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n5\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant failed to pay a state debt and federal income taxes in the\npast. These debts remained unpaid for a long period of time. He also filed for\nbankruptcy in 1997 and 2000. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 1993 and 2000. Since his bankruptcy discharge\nin 2000, he has not accumulated new, excessive unpaid debt. In fact, he has generally\nmanaged his monthly income and expenses for the past seven years. It is unlikely his\nliving expense debt problems of the 1990s will recur. His debt problems related to his\nliving expenses do not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \n\n6\nUnder AG 20(b), an Applicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nwhere Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial  problems arose when he lost his federal\njob and could not find employment in his career field. He worked as a contractor for\nperiods of time, but not steadily. His wife also worked, but at a significantly lower salary.\nApplicant resolved his credit debt problems through bankruptcy in 2000. Since this time,\nhe has managed his income and expenses, stayed away from excessive credit card\nuse, and generally lived within his financial means. His only major negative is his\nadmitted failure to file tax returns in 2005 and 2006. He acted responsibly in identifying\nand resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not obtain credit counseling, so\nthis mitigation condition is not applicable.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant contacted\nthe IRS and developed a repayment plan for his unpaid taxes, which he believed to\nhave been discharged in bankruptcy. He also contact the state and recently paid his\ndebt. With the resolution of his outstanding state debt and the ability to easily comply\nwith the repayment terms on his tax debt, he is financially sound and prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply. The mitigating\nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e and 20 (f) do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began\nwhen the federal government laid him off from his job in 1993. Although he worked\nbetween 1993 and 1999, he did not work steadily. He obtained contract work which\nusually lasted for a period of time, such as six months. When the job ended, he\nexperienced a time of lost income while he looked for and obtained other employment.\n(See AG \u00b6 (a)(2).) In 1999, he began working for his current employer and has worked\nsteadily for more than eight years. \nApplicant resolved his mounting debt problems created by his employment\nissues in the 1990s by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000. Following the discharge\nof his debts, he managed his finances in a more prudent manner. He has not and does\nnot live excessively. His decision not to file his income tax returns in 2005 and 2006\nbecause he did not have the money to pay his full tax bill each year reflected poor\njudgment on his part. However, he has resolved the problem created by this decision.\nHe forced himself to put aside his fear of communicating to and working with the IRS.\nHe recently developed a plan with the IRS, which includes repayment of all his old\nunpaid taxes and his more recent unpaid taxes. He has made the required payments\nsince reaching this agreement and reduced the number of dependents claimed for\nwithholding his tax dollars. He also resolved his state debt problem. Applicant has\nundergone significant behavioral changes in his attitude towards financial management.\nHe realizes that tax debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy and feels very good about\nhis ability to live within his financial means. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1), (3), (6).) His debts are\nproblems in the past. He has accepted responsibility for his tax debts and is paying this\ndebt. His taxes cannot be a source of coercion, exploitation, duress, or pressure. There\nis little likelihood that his debt problems will reoccur. His finances do not raise a concern\nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG  \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(8), (9).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of her clearance application and financial irresponsibility renders\nher an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance denied.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended and\n1\nmodified\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 23 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 9 May 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 11 June 2007, and I convened a hearing 10 July\n2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 18 July 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nBefore the hearing, Department Counsel (DC) moved to amend the SOR by adding six\nadditional debts totaling over $9,300. At hearing, DC acknowledged that the information supporting\nthe new allegations was known to the government when the original SOR was issued, and produced\nno persuasive argument that the government would suffer prejudice if the motion was not granted.\nIn the interest of judicial economy, I denied the motion (Tr. 24).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the financial allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate her\nadmissions as findings of fact. She denied falsifying her clearance application. She is a 43-year-old\nadministrative aide for a defense contractor since May 1978. She appears to have held a clearance\nsince March 1992.\nWhen Applicant submitted her clearance application in September 2005 (G.E. 1), she\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to two questions (questions 28 a. and b.) asking if she had been 180 days delinquent\non any accounts  within the last seven years, or was currently 90 days delinquent on any account. In\nfact, she had been 180 days delinquent on 17 accounts totaling over $49,000, and was currently 90\ndays delinquent on those 17 accounts, plus one more account referred for collection in April 2005.\nApplicant has offered no credible explanation for her failure to disclose her financial difficulties. She\nhas variously claimed that she overlooked the question, or knew that the background investigation\nwould uncover any adverse information. However, she also acknowledged that she had gone to court\non a delinquent account in 2004, was having her state income tax refunds seized by her state to pay\nback taxes, and had numerous debts that she knew were delinquent (Tr. 84-89). Further, Applicant\nknew that she had been receiving collection letters from the creditors, and that she was not paying\non each account every month.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to April 2000. She ascribes her\nfinancial difficulties to separating from her husband in July 2000, and their final divorce in 2005.\nHowever, the record demonstrates that her financial problems were emerging before her separation,\nwith two delinquent accounts in April 2000 and one delinquent account in July 2000. Although she\nwent from a two-income family to a one-income family in July 2000, her financial difficulties were\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nreally due to her failure to live within her means and spending significant sums on non-essential\nitems (Tr. 80). After her separation from her husband, she opened credit accounts without regard for\nher ability to repay the creditors. When those accounts became delinquent and closed to further\ncharges, she would open new credit accounts and repeat the process. In this fashion, she accrued\nnumerous delinquent accounts in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, until she had a last delinquent\naccount in April 2005. She accumulated 18 delinquent debts totaling nearly $50,000, none of which\nshe made any effort to repay despite the fact that several of the debts were less than $200 each. She\nwas goaded into seeking credit counseling, which resulted in a referral to a bankruptcy attorney, only\nafter the judgment creditor at SOR 1.n. succeeded in attaching her bank accounts in November 2006\n(Tr. 52). Even though she only actually lost three paychecks (Tr. 56-57), she had to borrow about\n$4,500 from family and friends until the holds were removed in March 2007 (Tr. 53-54).  Although\nshe began the counseling-bankruptcy process in February or March 2007, her bankruptcy petition\nhad not yet been filed because she had not accumulated the cash to pay the bankruptcy attorney.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\n\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n4\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n\u00b616.(a) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel\n8\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b617.(a)  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n9\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n\u00b617.(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or significantly contributed\n10\nto by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process . . . [later] the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n4\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect nearly $50,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired after Applicant\u2019s separation from her husband in July 2000.  In effect, she is a serial abuser\n3\nof credit, opening accounts that she knows she is unable to pay, purchasing non-essential items,\ndefaulting on her payments, then opening new accounts to start the process anew.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Applicant has not\n4\nestablished that her debts were due to circumstances beyond her control, or that she has acted\nresponsibly in addressing her debts.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit counseling or\n5\notherwise brought the problem under control.  Applicant has taken no verifiable steps to address her\n6\ndebts.  Even if I assumed that she would soon be filing her bankruptcy petition and would obtain\n7\nnecessary financial relief, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant would be able to\nremain financially stable in the future. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. She deliberately concealed the nature and extent of her financial\nproblems.  Further, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. There is no evidence\n8\ndemonstrating that she corrected the falsification before being asked about it.  There is no evidence\n9\nto suggest that Applicant receive bad advice about what she was required to disclose on her clearance\napplication.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\n10\n\n5\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.

He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the United States Navy from 1976 th 1982 and again from 1989 to November 2003. Both of his discharges were honorable. Applicant is employed as a shipping and receiving clerk by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they are cited in the SOR, and to which, as stated above, Applicant admitted: 1.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1979 to at least early in 2006. 1.b. In March 1979, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He plead guilty to the reduced charge of Reckless Driving, and he was fined.

On August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline G for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 21, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on November 1, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nNovember 8, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 17, 2007.\nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 9, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and had two other witnesses testify for\nhim. He submitted no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nJanuary 8, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December\n\n2\n26, 2007, to submit an additional document.  On December 18, 2007, he submitted\nExhibit A, without objection, and the record closed on that date. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.h.,\nunder Guideline G. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 49 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the\nUnited States Navy from 1976 th 1982 and again from 1989 to November 2003. Both of\nhis discharges were honorable. \nApplicant is employed as a shipping and receiving clerk by a defense contractor,\nand he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense sector.\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR, and to which, as stated above, Applicant admitted:\n1.a.  The SOR alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times to excess\nand to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1979 to at least early in 2006.\n1.b. In March 1979, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol (DUI). He plead guilty to the reduced charge of Reckless Driving,\nand he was fined. Applicant was 21 years old at the time and serving in the U.S. Navy. \n1.c. Applicant voluntarily entered a U.S. Navy Alcohol Program for two weeks in\n2000.\n1.d. On October 31, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DUI, (2)\nDriving While Having an 0.08%or Higher Blood Alcohol, and (3) Hit-Run Driving. He\nplead guilty to Count (1), and he was sentenced to five days in jail with a work-release\ngranted. Applicant was also ordered to complete a 90 Day First Offender Program, pay\na fine of $1,695, serve three years of probation, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted\nfor 90 days. Counts (2) and (3) were dismissed. Applicant violated the terms of his\nprobation by an alcohol related in arrest that occurred in June 2004, as will be\ndiscussed in 1.g., below. On October 21, 2004, his probation was reinstated and\ncontinued with the same terms and conditions as before.  \n1.e. Applicant attended a court appointed First Offender DUI Program from\nFebruary 5, 2004, through May 7, 2004.\n\n3\n1.f. Applicant averred in a signed, sworn statement that he executed on June 1,\n2004, that he had abstained completely from alcohol, since his DUI arrest in October\n2003. He further stated that his intention was to remain alcohol free.  \n1.g. On July 11, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI with a Prior\nOffense.  He plead guilty, and he was sentenced to serve 45 days of work furlough,\nwhich was reduced to 30 days and to pay a fine of $2,350. He was also ordered to\nparticipate in an 18 month alcohol treatment program.  Finally, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s\nlicense was restricted for one year, and he was placed on probation until 2011.\nApplicant reports every month on his probation, and he is paying $50 a month to pay off\nhis fine. He was not sure if the probation would continue to 2009 or 2011. \n1.h. Applicant attended a court appointed Multiple Offender DUI Program from\nNovember 8, 2004, through September 20, 2006, in which he was diagnosed as a\n\u201cProblem Drinker.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption has been extensive at times. From 1998 to\nOctober 2003, his usage increased. In 1998 he consumed six to eight beers per work\nweek at his home, and during the weekend he consumed eight to ten beers, either at\nhis home or at a bar. In 2003, his alcohol consumption increased to six to eight beers,\ntwo times during the week, and twelve to fifteen beers during the weekend either at\nhome or at a bar.  In July 2004, after his second DUI arrest, he reduced his\nconsumption to six to eight beers a week at home, and he never drove after he drank\nalcohol. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he had last consumed six or seven beers\nin November 2005, when he went on a trip with his mother to Hong Kong. After he\nreturned he did not consume any other alcoholic beverage until the weekend before the\nhearing, when at a party he was offered a drink of a liqueur, which he consumed, which\ncontradicted his express intention, as he stated in an interrogatory propounded to him\nby the Government and signed by him on June 13, 2007, (Exhibit 3) to remain alcohol\nfree.\nWhen asked if he was an alcoholic, Applicant initially answered affirmatively that\nhe is an alcoholic, but he immediately thereafter changed his opinion and answered that\nhe has put it behind him. He now believes it is alright to consume alcohol on special\noccasions. He identified the time he was on a vacation with his mother in Europe, when\nhe consumed six or seven beers, and his recent attendance at a party, when he had\none drink of liqueur, as the only special occasions on which he consumed alcohol since\n2004. Although Applicant testified that on most weekends he goes to a sports bar to\nwatch football games on television, he does not consume any alcoholic beverages when\nhe is there. \nApplicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sporadically, but he stated that\nbecause he is shy, he has never sought a sponsor, nor has he attempted to work the 12\nsteps of the program. \n\n4\nThe first witness to testify on Applicant\u2019s behalf was his real estate agent and\nfriend. They have known each other since 2001, when Applicant purchased his\ncondominium through her. The witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s two DUI arrests, but\nshe was not aware of an ongoing problem with alcohol. She did know that Applicant has\nattended AA meetings.  \nThe second witness was Applicant\u2019s stepmother.  She testified that she has\nraised Applicant since he was four years old and that he is a good son who does not\nusually get in trouble. She added that his father died four years ago and that was a\ndifficult blow for Applicant.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n5\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes disqualifying conditions (DC) that could raise a security\nconcern. Because of Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol use, including three arrests\nfor DUI and his consumption of alcohol, after stating that he intended to remain alcohol\nfree, the following DC apply to this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents\nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides mitigating conditions (MC) that apply to this case:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nApplicant has attempted to abstain from alcohol before but been unsuccessful.\nHowever, his alcohol consumption has been reduced dramatically since his heaviest\nusage in 2003 and 2004, and Applicant does acknowledge his previous serious alcohol\nproblems. He now only consumes alcohol on special occasions, and as a former alcohol\nabuser, he now is able to use alcohol in a moderate and responsible way. Therefore,\nbased on Applicant\u2019s extremely limited alcohol use over the last three years, I conclude\nthat Applicant has overcome his alcohol problems. \n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, I find that Applicant has certainly greatly improved his situation\nregarding alcohol consumption, and he is a decent person, who will continue to control\nhis alcohol issues.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1f.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor  Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Le'i, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has an extensive teenage history of alcohol and illegal drug use and \nrelated problems. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under alcohol consumption and drug involvement. She did rebut or mitigate \nthe personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 14, 2008, detailing security \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nconcerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline H, drug involvement, \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \n  \n \nOn March 19, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated April 22, 2008. Applicant was sent a \ncopy of the FORM, along with notice of her opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant's response to the FORM was due 30 days after receipt of a copy of the \nFORM. On May 5, 2008, Applicant received the FORM. As of July 2, 2008, no response \nhad been received. On July 7, 2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.b, 3.a \nand 4.a of the SOR. She admitted the remaining factual allegations, with explanations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 21-year-old administrative assistant, born in September 1986, who \nhas worked for a defense contractor since November 2005, and is seeking to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant admitted that, at times, between 2002 (age 16) and May \n2007 (age 20) she consumed alcohol to excess. At age 16, she was smoking marijuana \nand drinking \u201calmost every day.\u201d (Item 7, R-60) In 2003, she started skipping school \n\u201calmost every day.\u201d (Item 7, R-60)  \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant was ticketed for reckless driving, which resulted in the \nsuspension of her driver\u2019s license, fines, court costs, and she was required to attend \ndriver\u2019s improvement training. This was an alcohol related incident. (Item 7) The charge \nwas reduced from driving under the influence (DUI) to reckless driving due to \nApplicant\u2019s cooperated with the police. (Item 7, R-60, R-67)  \n \nDuring the Summer and Fall of 2002, she attended an outpatient treatment \nprogram twice a week. She did not complete the program. During her attendance in the \nprogram, she was drinking continuously. (Item 7, R-60) \n \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant stopped using marijuana because she felt it was \nbecoming a problem, but continued to drink. (Item 7, R-60) Shortly after her driving \ncharge, she returned to using marijuana. In March 2004, she appeared in court on \npossession of an alcoholic beverage charge. (Item 7, R-15) \n \nOn February 17, 2004, she was called to the school office and shown pictures of \nher smoking marijuana off the school grounds. Alcohol was smelled on her breath and a \nbreathalyzer confirmed she had been drinking that morning. She was charged with \nbeing under the influence of alcohol at school resulting in a three day suspension. \nIn February and March 2004, she received 30-day inpatient treatment for alcohol \ndependence, cannabis dependency, and substance induced mood disorder. (Item 7, R-\n\n \n \n \n3\n6, R-69) Her alcohol use for the month prior to her admission was three to four times a \nweek. She generally drank on weekends and over the month prior to her admission she \nwas drinking on weekdays.  Each time she drank it was to the point of intoxication. She \ngenerally drank seven or eight hard liquor drinks and seven or eight beers until she was \nintoxication. (Item 7, R-67) She was also using marijuana daily for a month or two prior \nher admission. (Item 7, R-15) Her drug use was costing her about $50 per week. (Item \n7, R-67) Her longest period of abstinence from illegal drugs was three months. (Item 7, \nR-67)  \nOn March 23, 2004, she successfully completed intensive inpatient treatment for \nchemical dependency and was discharged. (Item 7, R 101) Following her discharge, \nApplicant participated in an outpatient aftercare program. She failed to complete the \noutpatient program due to continued use of alcohol and marijuana. Applicant\u2019s attitude \nhad deteriorated to the point she did not care about the treatment, consequences, or \nschool. She was unable to complete the one course she needed for high school \ngraduation and was required to complete the course in summer school. In May 2004, \nshe tested positive for marijuana. Subsequent tests, until her discharge, were also \npositive. (Item 7, R-6) She was withdrawn from the program due to her lack of \nmotivation to continue and her parent\u2019s unwillingness to continue to support her \nmarginal efforts. (Item 7, R-6) In May 2004, she stopped participating in the program. \n(Item 6) \nApplicant used marijuana from 2002 (age 16) to at least June 2005 (age 18). \nDuring that time, she purchased and sold marijuana. From January 2005 to June 2005, \nshe purchased and used cocaine.  \nNot withstanding her 2004 treatment for alcohol and cannabis dependence, she \ncontinued using alcohol until May 2007 and marijuana until June 2005. Applicant \nasserts she has matured greatly since her treatment. (Item 5) \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Question 23 d. asked her if she had ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. She answered \n\u201cno.\u201d Applicant did reveal her illegal drug use on the form.  She indicated she had used \ncocaine ten times between January 2005 and June 2005 and had used marijuana \n\u201cmany times.\u201d (Item 4) In fact, she was, at times, smoking marijuana three or four times \na day. (Item 6) In response to question 24 a., she indicated she had used illegal drugs, \nbut failed in question 24.c to indicate she had ever purchased or sold illegal drugs. \n \nDuring an October 2006 interview, Applicant stated her drug use had caused \nproblems with her family because they wanted her to stop and she would not. Applicant \nasserted she did not intend to use drugs or alcohol in the future and cited as motivation \nher desire to lead a better and healthier life. (Item 6)  \n \n\n \n \n \n4\nIn May 2007, she responded to written interrogatories. (Item 5) She stated she \nwas drinking three or four beers on the weekends. (Item 5, I-2) As of May 2007, she \nwas attending community college.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n \n \n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical \npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an \nalcohol rehabilitation program; and, \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 (a) applies due to alcohol-related incidents away from work including: \nthe alcohol related July 2003 reckless diving charge, her February 2004 suspension \nfrom high school, and her March 2004 court appearance on the possession of an \nalcoholic beverage charge. AG \u00b6 22 (c) applies due to her admissions that at times she \nwas drinking daily to the point of intoxication. AG \u00b6 22 (e) applies because she was \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. AG \u00b6 22 (f) applies because, after completing her \n\n \n \n \n6\ninpatient treatment in March 2004, she was unable to complete the aftercare program \ndue to her continued drinking and marijuana use. As of May 2007, she was still drinking.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or \ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or \nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a \nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  AG \u00b6 23 (a) does not apply because the \nbehavior was not infrequent and it did not occur under unusual circumstances. Since \nshe was still drinking a year ago, it is too soon to find her prior behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 23 (b) does not apply because there is no acknowledgement of alcoholism \nor issues of alcohol abuse. Additionally, evidence of actions to overcome the problem \nare lacking from the record. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant fails to state she is no \nlonger drinking or understands her problem. AG \u00b6 23 (c) does not apply because there \nis no showing she is in a counseling or treatment program or that she is making \nsatisfactory progress. AG \u00b6 23 (d) does not apply because Applicant never successfully \ncompleted aftercare or has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence.  \n \nI do not find against Applicant because she sought treatment for her alcohol \nproblem, but do find against her for failing to complete the program and failing to \ncomplete after care due to her continued alcohol use.  \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement in that \nthe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an \n\n \n \n \n7\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical \npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social \nworker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a duly \nqualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nThe following AG conditions apply: AG \u00b6 25 (a) drug abuse; AG \u00b6 25 (b) testing \npositive for illegal drug use during her treatment program; AG \u00b6 25 (c) purchasing and \nselling illegal drugs; AG \u00b6 25 (e) being diagnosed as cannabis dependent; and AG \u00b6 25 \n(f) failure to complete aftercare treatment due to her continued alcohol and marijuana \nusage.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but \nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, \nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n \nNone of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns apply. AG \u00b6 26 (a) \ndoes not apply because the use was daily, did not occur under unusual circumstances, \nand the last use was just over three years ago. Applicant states she will not use illegal \ndrugs again. However, there is no showing she has disassociation from drug-using \nassociates and contacts, changed or avoids the environment where drugs are used, or \nexecuted a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation. It has been three years since her last use. Considering the frequency and \nhistory of her use this period of abstinence is insufficient, AG \u00b6 26 (b) does not apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (c) does not apply because prescription drugs were not abused. AG \u00b6 \n26 (d) does not apply because Applicant failed to complete aftercare. In fact, she last \nused illegal drugs in June 2005, more than a year after she stopped participating in the \naftercare program in May 2004. I do not find against Applicant because she sought \ntreatment for her illegal drug problem, but do find against her for failing to complete \ntreatment, failing to complete aftercare, and using marijuana after completing treatment.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nIn an October 2006 interview, Applicant stated she had stopped using drugs and \nalcohol in June 2005. In May 2007, she had returned to drinking beer. The fact \nApplicant started drinking again after the interview does not prove she lied at the \ninterview. Applicant has denied intentional falsification.  \n \nDeliberate omissions, concealment, or falsifications of material facts in any \nwritten document or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security \nclearance, are certainly of security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully.  \n \nIn this case, Applicant stated, at the time of the interview, she indented to stop \nusing drugs or alcohol. She was motivated by a desire for a better and healthier life. \nShe said she would not use in the future. This could be construed as a promise to stop \nor her prediction concerning her future use. It was merely her stated intent. The fact she \nreturned to drinking beer a year and a half later fails to establish her October 2006 \n\n \n \n \n9\nstatements were intentionally false. There is no showing she was using illegal drugs or \nalcohol when she made her statements. I find her actions did not constitute deliberate \nand willful falsification.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nProviding false answers to the federal government during the course of official \nbusiness is a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony. However, \nI have found Applicant statements about possible future use of alcohol and illegal drugs \nwas not an intentionally false statement. Therefore, I find for Applicant as to criminal \nconduct.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has an extensive history of \ndrug and alcohol use and problems. She has abstained from illegal drugs usage for \nslightly over three years and she last used alcohol a year ago, it is too soon to say her \nproblems will not recur. \n \nApplicant is still very young, she is only 21 years old. She acknowledges the \nnegative impact of her past conduct as a teenager. She realizes how her poor decisions \nconcerning alcohol and drug use have hindered her. As an immature person she made \n\n \n \n \n10\nimmature decisions. She now asserts she is more mature, responsible, and is attending \ncommunity college.  \n \nAlthough her evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, this decision \nshould not be construed as a determination that Applicant can not or will not attain the \nstate of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a DoD security \nclearance. Applicant fell victim to vices that plague many young people. Applicant has \nseen the error of her ways.  \n \nIn the future, should she be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance, with the passage of sufficient additional time, continued rehabilitation, and no \nfuture incidents of misconduct, the alcohol consumption and drug involvement could be \nfound in Applicant's favor. She may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of security \nworthiness. But that time has not yet arrived. Because the Applicant meets the \ndisqualifying conditions and none of the mitigating conditions, the alcohol and drug \nsecurity concern is resolved against her. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nAlcohol consumption: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1g: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nDrug involvement:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-h: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nPersonal conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nCriminal conduct: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 18, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the Guideline F mitigating conditions; whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is erroneous;\nand whether the Judge used the proper standard in deciding Applicant\u2019s case.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant is a high school graduate who has\ntaken some college courses over the years.  He is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, having served from\n1991 through his honorable discharge in 2004.  His decision to leave the Air Force was prompted\nby a 2003 driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) conviction.  Shortly after leaving the Air\nForce, Applicant began struggling financially. \nBy late 2006, he had accrued approximately $40,000 of delinquent debt, including among\nother things, $1,300 in delinquent court fines stemming from the 2003 DUI, $3,700 in delinquent\nchild support payments, $3,500 in eviction and miscellaneous property rental dispute fees, $25,000\non two delinquent car notes, and $2,100 in delinquencies related to a time-share property purchased\nbefore he left the Air Force.  Applicant provided no documentation to support his claim that he was\nmaking efforts to pay off his debts.  He has never attended debt counseling, and all of the\ndelinquencies remain outstanding.\nThe Board has considered Applicant\u2019s claims of error.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Annie Traylor Briscoe, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 22, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case on November 15, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on November 21, 2007, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on December 14, 2007. During the hearing, I received five government\nexhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on December 20, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJanuary 18, 2008\n\nAlthough his decision to leave was voluntary, he characterized the DUI as a \u201ccareer-killer\u201d (Tr. 82).\n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is a 43-year-old\nmarried man with one child, age 18. He and his wife have been married since 1994. His\nfirst marriage ended in divorce in 1993.\nApplicant is a high school graduate who has taken some college courses over\nthe years. He is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, having served from 1991 through his\nhonorable discharge in 2004 (Exhibit 5). His decision to leave the Air Force was\nprompted by a 2003 driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) conviction.1\nShortly after leaving the Air Force, Applicant began struggling financially. By late\n2006, he had accrued approximately $40,000 of delinquent debt, including among other\nthings, $1,300 in delinquent court fines stemming from the 2003 DUI (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.c and 1.l), $3,700 in delinquent child support payments (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.j), $3,500 in eviction and miscellaneous property rental dispute fees\n(SOR subparagraphs 1.i and 1.s), $25,000 on two delinquent car notes (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h), and $2,100 in delinquencies related to a time-share\nproperty purchased before he left the Air Force (SOR subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n).\nIn May 2007, the government propounded interrogatories to Applicant concerning\nthe status of his delinquencies (Exhibit 2). In response, he stated he had either\narranged payment plans or had begun making payments. He provided no\ndocumentation to support these contentions. At the hearing, he repeated these\ncontentions and again provided no documentation. He has never attended debt\ncounseling. All of the delinquencies remain outstanding.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n3\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nHere, Applicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the applicability of AG & 19(a), \u201can\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. He\nhas neither satisfied any delinquencies, executed any payment plans, or entered a debt\ncounseling program. Although the difficult transition from military to civilian life\n\n4\ncontributed to his financial difficulties, and could conceivably trigger the application of\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d he left the military after a DUI conviction. This\ndoes not constitute a circumstance beyond his control. Moreover, he has not acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant has longstanding delinquent financial indebtedness. I was particularly\ntroubled by the delinquent court-ordered debts, and his repeated failure to provide\ndocumentation that he is satisfying some of his debts. Without a concrete debt\nrepayment plan, the likelihood of recurrence remains unacceptably high. Evaluating this\ncase in light of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant remains a security\nconcern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 27, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C.\nWesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings were\nnot based upon substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had attempted to develop technology for\nthe detection of explosive devices.  He decided to finance this development through the use of his\ncredit card.  At the time of the decision, Applicant had delinquent debts in excess of $152,000, most\nof which were for cash withdrawals on the credit card.  Other debts, however, pertained to student\nloans taken out to finance his wife\u2019s education.  The Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s few assets make\na debt consolidation loan impracticable.  In his Conclusions section, the Judge stated that Applicant\nhad failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial problems, \u201c[t]aking into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations and lack of\nconcrete steps taken to date to resolve them . . .\u201d  Decision at 8.

Given the level of his carried debt loan\nand repayment uncertainty, he is unable to mitigate security concerns associated with his past history\nof delinquent debts.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 21, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 24, 2007.  A hearing was\nheld on July 24, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three  exhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses (including\nhimself) and three exhibits, each containing multiple sub-parts.  The transcript (R.T.) was received\non August 8, 2007.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 15 delinquent debts exceeding\n$152,000.00.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covering his\ndelinquent debts, and furnished numerous explanations of the debts and his repayment plan that is\nconditioned on his receiving Government grants to fund his patented device.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 43-year-old adjunct professor and principal of a defense contractor who has\nheld a security clearance since 1986 and seeks to retain his clearance.  The allegations covered in the\nSOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nOver the past ten years, Applicant has established a good reputation as a scientist, college\nprofessor and community college instructor.  He has no history of breaking rules for safeguarding\nsensitive proprietary and classified information.  He made a conscious choice in 2001, however, to\nfinance the development and marketing of his three patented laser verification authentication Raman\nSpectrometer devices (lvars device) through the use of credit cards and other debt financing means.\nHe made this choice on the expectation his company (OFT) would obtain its required facility\nclearance, and be awarded a $30 million defense contract for the licensed use of his patented lvars\ndevice (see ex. B(19)).  Applicant describes his lvars as a laser-based system designed \u201cto detect\nexplosives both at point (within one meter), as well as at a distance, which could be hundreds, if not\nthousands, of meters\u201d away (R.T., at 154). He claims available explosives detection systems tend\nto yield false negatives, which place soldiers serving in Iraq in harm\u2019s way (R.T., at 167).  \n Even before Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s facility clearance was denied, however, the Army\u2019s\nresponsible approval organization informed Applicant\u2019s company that it had decided not to pursue\nthe company\u2019s proposal (see ex. A(12); R.T., at 138-40).  The responsible organization cited the\ndevice\u2019s described technique of remotely detecting and characterizing explosives as a technique that\n\u201cis extremely high risk and unproven\u201d (see ex. A(12); R.T., at 145).  The organization noted the\nproponents\u2019 failure to construct any basic test prototype, as well as the absence of any included\ntechnical plan or analysis of how OFT expected to overcome detected technical obstacles (ex.\nA(12)).  By contrast, the responsible approving organization noted the existence of other\ndevelopmental techniques for remote detection of explosives that have been successfully prototyped\nand demonstrated (A(12)). \nAt no place in the responsible organization\u2019s October 2006 response did it attempt to tie the\nproposal to its sponsor\u2019s obtaining a facility clearance or suggest any potential for renewed interest\nin the proposal in the future.  Despite assurances from Applicant and W3 that the Army\u2019s responsible\napproval organization could be expected to look favorably on Applicant\u2019s lvars contract proposal\nonce OFT obtained its facility clearance, neither provide any documentary support for this\nanticipated action. Certainly, there are no documentary assurances from the responsible organization\nor inserted contract conditions that would offer any realistic hope of reconsideration in the future\n(R.T., at 175).   Under the circumstances,  there are simply too many variables at this time to draw\nany meaningful inferences about the prospects of Applicant and his company\u2019s obtaining Army\napproval of his device.\nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts (15 altogether) after 2001, mostly credit\ncard-related, while developing three patented prototype IED detectors and seeking to obtain funding\ngrants for the device from the responsible approving organization (see ex. B-11 through 22; T., at\n80-95, 108-09).  After incorporating his company in 1998, Applicant, to date, has been unsuccessful\nin raising grant money to develop and market his device for lack of collateral and has had to turn to\n\u201cbootstrapping\u201d techniques through his credit cards to raise the necessary funds to sustain his\npersonal and professional needs (R.T., at 118).  He briefly considered pursuing Chapter 11 relief, but\nhe ultimately determined not to pursue bankruptcy out of concern for creditor attachment of his IED\ndetector, in the event of payment default (R.T., at162-63).  While the vast majority of his\naccumulated delinquent debts represent cash withdrawals on his credit cards to fund his project, three\nof his listed debts represent student loans taken out to finance his wife\u2019s education (creditors 1.I\nthrough 1.k) and, as such, are not directly linked to his business project (R.T., at 135-37).\nAltogether, he accumulated over $21,000.00 in student loans.\n\n4\nThe listed credit card accounts listed in the SOR bear the personal names of Applicant and\nhis wife, and not his company, OFT (R.T., at 140-41).  Applicant never pursued company credit\ncards or explored a business line of credit to finance his project because his company did not have\nany assets aside from his three patents to use as collateral (R.T., at 141, 159-61).  Applicant never\nconsidered a business loan or home equity loan to finance his project.  He not only does not own a\nhome, but has no other appreciable assets to collateralize a loan besides his patents, which he does\nnot wish to risk losing.\nWhile he could perhaps generate capital contributions from his partners who contributed\n$5,000.00 to $10,000.00 each (five partners in all), and to a lesser extent from the four other\ninvestors who contributed small amounts to the project (R.T., at 142), he does not think such\ncontributions would be sufficient to cover his cash needs on the project.   Licensing his technology\nto raise venture capital is not an option either, because (again) he could run the risk of losing control\nof his intellectual property, which would be needed to collateralize any venture funding (R.T., at\n160).  \nApplicant and his OFT company have worked hard to maintain control of their patents on\nthe lvars device he developed.  He characterizes himself as the chief scientist and developer of the\nproject covering the patented device (R.T., at 130-31, 169).  At the present, he and his company\ncontinue to seek a facility clearance for his OFT company and a personal security clearance for\nhimself, which he claims has been an unfulfilled condition to his firm\u2019s finalizing its $30 million\ndevelopment contract with a major prime defense contractor, which wants his patented dual use\ndevice for use in meeting the latter\u2019s Army contracts (R.T., at 108-09, 146).  Applicant assures his\ntechnology lacks any real U.S. competition and only a few foreign countries who are currently doing\nany known research in this IED detector area (R.T., at 164).  He states the detector device has good\ndual use potential to the responsible Army reviewing organization due to its capability to eliminate\nboth false positives and false negative signals for military vehicles operating in war zones.  With the\nfunds he expects from his company\u2019s finalizing its expected contract with the identified defense\ncontractor, Applicant believes he will be able to pay off his accumulated delinquent debts from his\ncompany\u2019s expected contract award (R.T., at 106-07).  Without the contract, though, he cannot see\nhow he can pay any of his delinquent creditors, in which case he would expect to relocate and\nexplore anticipated job opportunities for himself and his wife (R.T., at 107-08).\nMarried since 1999, Applicant characterizes his lifestyle as frugal.  He has few tangible assets\nto claim as his own.  Specifically, he claims his personal bank account as his only bank account, and\nhe has no stocks, bonds, real estate, insurance policies, or interests in any companies other than his\nown company (see ex. A-8 through 10; R.T., at 97-98).  He estimates his personal property to be nor\nmore than $35,000.00 in total value.   Standing alone, without any major contract support from the\nArmy\u2019s approving organization, his patents lack any appreciable value (R.T., at 165). \nApplicant and  his company have both patent and corporate attorneys on retainer to protect\nhis  patent and corporate interests and to date have been successful in perfecting and protecting their\npatented lvars device (see exs. B(20) and B(21); R.T., at 92-96).  Corporate counsel is responsible\nfor administering and arranging all of his company and personal accounts associated with his patent\nand related business interests.  Both Applicant and his spouse are pursuing advanced degrees to\nexpand their employment opportunities (R.T., at 107).  Applicant documents a fair credit score and\na record of good credit before he turned to deficit financing in 2002 (or thereabouts) to fund his\n\n5\npatent investments (R.T., at 60-61).  Should he and his company fail to obtain the defense contract\nthey seek, he intends to pursue a banking career to pay off his debts (R.T., at 111).\nApplicant currently takes home around $2,800.00 a month; his wife is a full time student and\ncurrently does not contribute to their household income.  He has around $350.00 in his checking\naccount (R.T., at 147), but no mutual funds or retirement plan that he could draw upon in times of\nemergency (R.T., at 148).  \nApplicant is highly regarded by former colleagues with whom he has shared  academic and\nbusiness pursuits in the scientific fields that Applicant has been involved in.  W1 (a high level\nmanager of a large financial institution) who has known Applicant since 1983 credits him with\noutstanding character and excellent earnings potential were he join his bank (R.T., at 12-14).  While\nW1 is aware of Applicant\u2019s experiencing financial difficulties from funding his project, he has no\nknowledge of the specific debts and amounts.  W2 is a former teaching colleague of Applicant\u2019s and\nrecollects his achieving excellent reviews from his students (R.T., at 40).  W2 is also unaware of\nApplicant\u2019s specific debts (R.T., at 42-43). \nAnother witness (W3) owns a specialty engineering firm that supports projects for the\nstrategic intelligence community (R.T., at 47-48) and holds a top secret security clearance (R.T., at\n70).  Through his association with an Army electronic warfare testing program, W3 became with\nApplicant, who at the time was one of his professors (R.T., at 48).  This missile program issued a\ncontract to Applicant\u2019s firm in 2005, contingent on Applicant\u2019s obtaining his security clearance\n(R.T., at 48-49, 71-72).  When Applicant was unable to obtain his clearance within conditioned time\nlimits, this special agency within the Army testing program terminated the contract (in April 2007),\nwith the understanding it could be renewed should Applicant obtain his security clearance (R.T., at\n71).  W3 is familiar with the security clearance process (having worked as a DSS personnel security\nadjudicator) and assures that because Applicant is the senior scientist with his contractor who owns\nthe underlying patents, the approving agency will approve no contract for his company without his\nobtaining his security clearance (R.T., at 62-64).  W3 expressed confidence in Applicant\u2019s intentions\nand ability to repay his debts, once the DoD contract was approved, but could point to nothing in\nwriting that would confirm the agency\u2019s intention to renew OPT contract in the event Applicant and\nhis country were to obtain their clearances (R.T., 71).  \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n6\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is an adjunct professor and principal of a closely held defense subcontractor  who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts in his effort to develop and market a patented lvars\ndevice.  Some of his accrued delinquent debts relate to student loans for his wife, but most of of his\ndebts cover credit card debts from his use of his cards to generate cash withdrawals (a process he\ncharacterizes as \u201cbootstrapping\u201d).   Considered together, Applicant\u2019s use of high risk fund-raising\n\n7\ntechniques to underwrite his project raise  security significant concerns under a personal security\nprogram that is grounded in the encouragement of low-risk behavior by the clearance holder.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Specifically, determined financial difficulties emanating from an applicant\u2019s  inability\nto sustain his use of borrowing on his credit cards without falling far behind, and eventual\ndelinquency, in the servicing of his financial obligations (in this case, credit card and student loan\naccounts) can place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his past failures to document payments on any\nof her listed debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and\nDC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his inability to sustain his longstanding corporate\nand personal efforts to develop and market his patented lvars device and finance his wife\u2019s education\nwith very little personal or business capital at his disposal (save for the patents themselves and some\nlimited funds of his own).  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s substantial debt accumulations are primarily linked to his persistent efforts\nto develop and market his company project and consummate a $30 million contract with an elite\nArmy agency, these debt accumulations cannot be considered to be unexpected given the substantial\noutlays required to develop an market the patented lvars device and place it with the Government.\n \nFundamentally, Applicant chose a high risk (\u201cbootstrapping\u201d) means to raise money for his\nproject.  While his earnest efforts to develop a valuable improvised explosive device detector are\ncommendable, they reflect a high risk choice on Applicant\u2019s part that is at odds with the low risks\nassociated generally with approved behavior and conduct under the Adjudicative Guidelines.\nMitigation credit is difficult for Applicant based on his lack of any presented repayment proofs\nand his still very speculative plan of repayment (conditioned on obtaining facility and personal\nsecurity clearances and approval of a $30 million Army agency contract for his patented detector\ndevice).  As a result of his choices and sizeable amount of his still unresolved accrued debts, he make\ntake little advantage of any of the Adjudicative Guidelines covering financial considerations.  Age\nof the debts at issue is potentially applicable, given the collective age of most of these covered\ndelinquent debts and potential applicability of pertinent statutes of limitation.  Having some\napplication, accordingly, is MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).   Because Applicant\u2019s decision to use his credit cards\nto employ \u201cbootstrapping\u201d techniques to finance his project represents conscious and deliberative\nactions on Applicant\u2019s part, his financing choices cannot be considered beyond his control.  Put\nanother way, a key requirement for invoking MC 20(b) of the financial consideration guidelines (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) is missing.\n\n8\nApplicant reaffirms his intention to pay his outstanding debts and has resisted suggestions to\npetition for Chapter 11 or 13 bankruptcy relief.  Due to his failure to seek financial counseling,\nhowever, he may not invoke MC 20(c) of the financial consideration  guidelines (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control).  Without any tangible repayment efforts to his credit,\nhe may not invoke MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) either.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person cleared\nto access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of\nthe clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties\nis vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases\n(as here). When high risk funding activities like Applicant\u2019s are assessed in juxtaposition to the\nrelatively low-risk standards of the Adjudicative Guidelines, the former, generally must give way, no\nmatter how potentially valuable the funded project might be to a particular defense department\ncustomer.\nApplicant was not without alternative choices to his resorting to financing his project through\nhis credit cards in hopes of his company\u2019s winning a contract from the approving Army organization.\nLicensing the patented technology to his partners, his company\u2019s prime contractor, or even a qualified\noutsider for a limited period with agreed upon return options was certainly one potential avenue to\npursue while he and his company awaited the outcome of their facility and personal security\napplications, respectively.  Drawing upon the capital resources of his partners and interested others\nwas another possible option.  With this option, Applicant might have been able to motivate potential\ninvestors with the prospect of an increased share in his patented projects.  And, of course, he might\nhave achieved something of a holding pattern with petitioned for Chapter 11 or13 relief.  True, all of\nthese alternative courses of actions could have placed Applicant and his company at risk to lose\ncontrol of the patented technology: either temporarily or permanently.  Nonetheless, Applicant did\nhave options at his disposal that did not involve his defaulting on $152,000.00 plus in personal debts.\nThe sheer size of these accumulated debt delinquencies is incompatible with the guidelines for\nestablishing minimum eligibility for holding a security clearance.\nThat Applicant has enjoyed a distinguished and successful career in his scientific and teaching\nendeavors is not in dispute.  By all accounts, he is a highly regarded scientist and inventor of\ntechnology that can potentially benefit the U.S. defense effort in Iraq and other war time theaters\naround the world.  But even according maximum whole person credits to Applicant\u2019s worthwhile\nscientific and teaching achievements, minimum security clearance eligibility standards do not permit\nthe level of relaxation of applicable adjudicative standards that Applicant seeks.  If an exception is\nto be made in recognition of Applicant\u2019 special and valuable contributions to the defense effort, it\ncannot be made at this adjudicative level.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and lack of concrete steps taken to date to resolve them, Applicant fails to mitigate\nsecurity concerns related to his covered debt delinquencies.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.o of the SOR.\n\n9\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2.2\nfactors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the\nFINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.i:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.j:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.k:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.l:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.m:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.n:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.o:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.
