Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 9, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 12, \n2022, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 27 delinquent debts and that she had a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy filing dismissed in 2018. In responding to the SOR, Applicant denied two of the \nalleged debts, claiming one was fraudulent and the other did not belong to her. In admitting the \nother alleged debts, Applicant claimed they were either paid, settled, or disputed. The Judge found \nfavor of Applicant on six debt allegations and against her on the remaining allegations. The Judge \nconcluded that Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief consists of the following assertion of error: \nI feel that my progress for my clearance was not fairly taken into consideration. I \nfelt that I had a bias against me because of the color of my skin. I felt uneasy and \nunheard when given the opportunity to submit the progress of my debt[.] I truly \nfelt that it was not taken into consideration and a decision was already made. \n[Appeal Brief at 1.] \nThe Appeal Board is tasked to address material issues raised by the parties to determine \nwhether the Judge committed factual or legal error. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32 \u2013 E3.1.32.3. There is no \npresumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and \nidentify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-12199 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005).  \nBias and Unlawful Discrimination \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that quasi-judicial officers are impartial and unbiased. \nSee Schweiker v. McClure, 456 U.S. 188, 195 (1982). An appealing party has a heavy burden of \ndemonstrating conduct by an Administrative Judge that deprived the hearing or decision of fairness \nand impartiality. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 94-0282 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1995) (citing \nFederal cases). In this regard, an adverse decision or adverse rulings, standing alone, do not \ndemonstrate judicial bias. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-03233 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2009) and \nISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020); see also Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751 at \n762 (10th Cir. 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s brief does not direct our attention to anything in the record that would likely \npersuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite impartiality. More \nspecifically, her claim that she felt uneasy and unheard is not sufficient to establish judicial bias. \nBased on our review of the record, we find no reason to conclude that the Judge exhibited bias \nagainst her. We conclude that Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to meet the heavy burden on her to rebut \nthe presumption of impartiality. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5. \nAdditionally, \nApplicant\u2019s bare allegation of discrimination is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case that \nshe was treated unfairly or differently on the basis of her race or the color of her skin. We find \nadversely to Applicant on these assignments of error.  \nWeighing Evidence \nIn the decision, the Judge cites to the specific evidence, i.e., exhibits and pages of the \ntranscript, supporting her findings of fact. In her brief, Applicant does not identify any specific \nevidence that the Judge did not consider. Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge did not consider \nher debt resolution progress amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. \nThis contention is not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence \nin the record or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd.

On January 25, 2022, after considering the \nrecord, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Philip J. \nKatauskas denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in the findings \nof fact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2015 \nuntil the present; that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2017 until the present \nwhile holding a security clearance; and that Applicant intends to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture. Applicant admitted the first two allegations with qualifications and denied the third. \nApplicant made inconsistent statements about the extent of his marijuana use. Moreover, in \nsecurity clearance applications (SCAs) completed in 2016 and in 2020 he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s stated intent to refrain from future marijuana use \nlacked credibility in view of contradictory statement denying use of marijuana between 2015 and \n2020 and by his explanation that he was confused regarding the information that he should \ndisclose. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent and frequent and that \nApplicant\u2019s promise of future abstention lacked credibility. He stated that the record raises doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness and that Applicant did not meet his burden of \npersuasion as to mitigation. \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. He argues that the \nJudge did not make findings about the frequency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and that he did not \nfind that Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions were accompanied by clarifying remarks. He also contends \nthat the Judge erred in finding that Applicant had denied use of marijuana between 2015 and 2020. \nRegarding this last argument, we conclude that the challenged finding is in error. In responding \nto the SOR, Applicant admitted infrequent marijuana use between 2015 and 2020. Item 5 at 18. \nHowever, even if he had not made this error the Judge\u2019s overall decision would have been the \nsame. Therefore, the error is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-02033 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n11, 2022). We have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact, and we conclude that, other than the error addressed above, the essential findings \nare based upon \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.   \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating factors. We conclude that \nhis arguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence \nin the record or to demonstrate that he weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01494 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 24, 2022). \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis complies with the requirements of the \nDirective in that he evaluated Applicant\u2019s case in light of the entirety of the record evidence. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02047 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 24, 2022). We note the Hearing Office cases \nthat Applicant has cited in support of his appeal and give them due consideration.  However, they \nare not binding precedent and, in any event, to not undermine the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions.

The lawsuit is not alleged in the SOR, nor is any related debt. This was a \nharmless error as it did not likely have an impact on the outcome of the case.

At that time, he revised \nhis intentions and committed to not using marijuana in the future. In Applicant\u2019s written statement \nof intent not to use drugs in the future, he stated that his full recognition of the legal implications \nof his employer\u2019s drug policy became clear to him when he reviewed new employee training \nmaterials in early 2020.

He \nhighlights that the mistake is prejudicial, as the earlier date would mean that he continued to use \nmarijuana after being fully advised as to the consequences.  \nOur review of the record confirms not that the Judge erred, but that Applicant submitted \ncontradictory evidence regarding when he received the drug policy training. In his April 2021 \nstatement of intent, Applicant wrote: \u201cDuring early 2020, I reviewed training material for new \n[defense contractor] employees . . . and this policy was made very clear.\u201d Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B \nat 1.

In responding to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted all debts, and the Judge found against Applicant on all allegations.  \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in her findings of fact, gave an appearance \nthat she was biased or less than impartial, and inquired into matters outside the SOR. Consistent \nwith the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact:  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \nThe Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below, in \npertinent part: \nApplicant is 30 years old and graduated from college in 2014. Before beginning his current \njob, Applicant had three periods of unemployment: August 2017 to April 2018, January 2019 to \nMay 2019, and August 2019 to November 2019.  \nApplicant lived with various family members after graduating college, but had an unstable \nliving situation. He and his fianc\u00e9e were expecting a child in February 2019 when they were asked \nto leave his parents\u2019 house. They moved in with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents and subsequently moved \nback in with his parents, but they were again asked to leave and were temporarily homeless. \nOn his December 2019 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he \nhad approximately $44,000 in delinquent student loans and cited his unstable living and financial \nsituation as the cause. On the SCA, he noted his intent to begin making monthly payments of \n$100. In his February 2020 clearance interview, Applicant confirmed the student loan debts and \nrepresented that he would contact the creditor that month and establish a monthly payment plan. \nIn his October 2021 hearing, Applicant testified that his mother had earlier made his student loan \npayments for some period of time, but then stopped; he was unsure when she stopped payments or \nhow much she paid. Applicant testified that he applied for a student loan rehabilitation program \nand began payments in March 2021. The program requires minimum monthly payments of $5 for \nnine consecutive months, and Applicant submitted documents confirming that he has made \nconsistent monthly payments of $50. He will complete rehabilitation in December 2021.  \nApplicant does not know what his monthly payments will be when he completes the \nrehabilitation program. His current monthly expenses outstrip his monthly income. Applicant \nbelieves that his student loans will ultimately be forgiven. \nThe SOR also alleges a car repossession debt, two medical debts, and a dental debt, totaling \napproximately $15,500. Both in his background interview and at hearing, Applicant stated his \nintent to file bankruptcy to resolve his delinquent debts. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted \ndocuments indicating that he had recently contacted these four creditors and started payments on \nthree of the four. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part: \nApplicant\u2019s mother paid his student loans for a period. After his mother stopped \npaying them, Applicant was unable to pay them himself. Although he indicated to \nthe investigator that he was going to begin paying them in 2020, he did not. In 2021, \nhe entered a student loan rehabilitation program, and has made consistent monthly \npayments of $50. If he makes the remaining payment, his loans will be out of \ndefault and a new payment program will be implemented. Applicant did not \nunderstand the specifics of what the new program would require. At this point, his \nloans remain in a default status, but are likely to be removed from that status. The \nfinancial statement on his student loan rehabilitation application reflects he has a \ndeficit of approximately $500 each month. \n2 \n\n \nBias \n  \nErrors in Findings of Fact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \nDiscussion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n.  .  . \nApplicant is supporting his fianc\u00e9e and their child and does not have the \nmeans at this time to pay his delinquent debts. I am not confident that he has a \nrealistic understanding of how his student loan rehabilitation program works, nor \nhas he planned for the likely increase in monthly payments once the loans are no \nlonger in a default status. Although the issues that caused his financial problems \nmay have been beyond his control, Applicant did not begin to address his defaulted \nstudent loans until a year after he completed his SCA and was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator. He did not make payments on the other legitimate \ndelinquent debts until after his hearing. He has not acted responsibly regarding his \nfinances.  [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in several findings of fact. For example, he highlights \nthat she erred in stating the dates for his periods of unemployment and erred by one month in \nstating when he would complete rehabilitation of his student loans. Our review of the record \nconfirms that any such errors were harmless, as they likely had no effect on the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020).  \nMore importantly, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that his student loans \nwere delinquent, as collections on defaulted Federal student loans have been paused since March \n2020.1 Applicant is raising the issue of the Federal pause for the first time in this appeal. In his \nMarch 2021 answer to the SOR, submitted during the Federal pause, Applicant admitted that the \nseven Federal student loans were delinquent. At hearing, he did not dispute the delinquencies, but \ninstead highlighted his recent efforts to rehabilitate the student loans. In her decision, the Judge \ndid not discuss the Federal pause. The record, however, contains two credit reports (one dated \nOctober 2020 and the other April 2021) pulled during the pause that reflect Applicant\u2019s student \nloans remained in a delinquent status. Government Exhibits 2 and 3. Those credit reports provide \na sufficient basis for the challenged finding. Applicant has failed to establish the Judge\u2019s finding \nregarding the student loans was flawed. See generally, ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOctober 28, 2021) for examples of delinquent student loans subject to the Federal pause that were \nnot mitigated.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant takes issue with both the tone and the content of the Judge\u2019s \nquestions and her dialogue with him. To the extent that Applicant is arguing that the Judge was \nbiased, we do not find that argument convincing. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge \nis impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden \n1 Under the CARES Act of March 2020, Federal student loans were placed in forbearance and collection on defaulted \nstudent loans was paused. By a series of executive orders, that protection has been extended through May 1, 2022. \nSee, e.g., https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \n3 \n\n  \nConduct Not Alleged in SOR \n \nNew Evidence \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof persuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). The issue is not \nwhether Applicant personally believes the Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant.  \nRather, the issue is whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that \nwould lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  \nApplicant cites several examples in which the Judge questioned him about particular \nexpenses or debts and then either did not allow him to answer fully or appeared to be dismissive \nof his answer. While the questioning and comments were occasionally sharp, the examples cited \nby Applicant do not rise to the level that might lead a reasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s \nimpartiality, nor do they rebut the presumption that the Judge ultimately decided the case on the \nrecord evidence. Applicant has failed to meet the heavy burden associated with a demonstration \nof bias on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-07395 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2010). \nApplicant also alleges that the Judge inquired into matters that \u201cweren\u2019t in the statement of \nreasons\u201d and \u201cweren\u2019t supposed to be discussed on record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. Applicant appears \nto be referring to the Judge\u2019s inquiry into non-alleged debts that were reflected on documents that \nhe submitted. Tr. at 47-49; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D. A judge may consider non-alleged debts (a) in \nassessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). Our review of the transcript confirms that the Judge\u2019s \ninquiries were confined to financial issues alleged on the SOR, closely-related debts, or issues of \ngeneral financial health and financial planning. Our review of the decision reveals that the Judge \nonly discussed the alleged debts in evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. We find no \nbasis for concluding that the Judge considered non-alleged debts or other matters in an \ninappropriate manner. Applicant\u2019s argument does not establish error by the Judge. \nFinally, Applicant has provided updated information regarding his debts and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s \nemployment. Those are new matters not contained in the record, which we cannot consider. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of his \ncase or in her decision. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for her decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 29, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On February 2, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are citizens \nof China and one is employed by the Hong Kong government. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges \nsix issues of concern, to include: an incident of sexual harassment, online financial relationships \nwith two women of unknown national origin, a misuse of information in Applicant\u2019s workplace, \nan avowed willingness to access work databases for personal use, and a history or questionable \njudgment and vulnerability to manipulation and exploitation. Applicant denied all allegations. \nThe Judge found for Applicant on one of the Guideline E allegations, but found adversely to him \non the remaining five Guideline E allegations and on the Guideline B allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence, rendering her adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is in his mid-forties.  Born in Hong Kong, he immigrated to the Unites States in \n1997, became a naturalized citizen in 2003, served in the Reserve force from 2005 to 2013, and \ndeployed to Iraq in 2007. While on active duty from 2013 to 2014, Applicant received an Article \n15 nonjudicial punishment for sexual harassment and fraternization and was discharged with an \nhonorable discharge. As a prospective government contract employee, Applicant completed a \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) in May 2018 and responded \u201cNo\u201d to a question that asked \nwhether he had been subject to a court-martial or other disciplinary action in the past seven years. \nIn his June 2018 clearance interview, Applicant disclosed Ms. M as a foreign contact with \nwhom he established an online romantic relationship in 2013 in response to an unsolicited email \nfrom her. They never met in person or by video, but exchanged photographs. When Ms. M \nreported to him that she was in danger and seeking to escape Togo, Applicant sent her funds via \nan attorney in Togo. They lost contact after Applicant could no longer afford to help her financially \nand have had no further contact.  \nIn response to subsequent government interrogatories, Applicant confirmed that his last \ncontact with Ms. M was in March 2017, that she was a refugee from an unknown country, and that \nhe provided her funds between 2015 and 2017. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he sent Ms. \nM approximately $7,000 and took out loans to provide her with the funds. He initially stated that \nhe expected to receive $500,000 from her as a reward for helping, but later said he did not expect \nto receive any reward. He no longer believes her story, and testified that the incident made him \nmore skeptical.  Applicant provided contradictory testimony and was not credible. \nIn early 2018, Applicant received another unsolicited email from a Ms. H., whom he \ndescribes as his girlfriend. She sent him nude photos on numerous occasion, and he sent her nude \nphotos about six times, as well as videos of him nude and performing sexual acts. They have never \nmet in person. Ms. H told Applicant that she needed to send him money from her clients; she \nasked him to open bank accounts, deposit the money and then send money orders to two people \nwhom he did not know. When asked at hearing if he believed Ms. H was using him for money \nlaundering, Applicant wavered in his response. \nApplicant testified that he used two accounts for Ms. H\u2019s money. After being blocked by \ntwo companies that transfer money, he sent the funds through Bitcoin.  He deposited money from \nan unknown source and sent Ms. H these funds, but also sent Ms. H his own money. He estimated \nthat he deposited and transferred back to Ms. H about a total of $10,000 of her funds and about \n$2,000 of his own money. At the time he completed his interrogatories in November 2020, \nApplicant was still sending her funds via Bitcoin to cover living expenses. When asked at hearing \nfor the last time he sent money, Applicant responded that he sent her $1,500 the week prior to \nhearing. Although he was not initially suspicious, Applicant now believes Ms. H\u2019s actions were \nnot legitimate and has cut off communication with her.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Ms. H first contacted Applicant, she lived in a neighboring state, but did not ever \nmeet each other. She is now in Nigeria. After he asked for a copy of her passport, she provided \none, which assuaged his concerns. He provided a copy for the hearing. An examination of the \npassport reveals it to be fraudulent. Applicant did not seem to understand that the scenarios he \nparticipated in with both women were scams and did not believe he had been manipulated. \nAt the Government\u2019s request, Applicant submitted to a psychological evaluation. In \naddition to discussions about the relationships outlined above, Applicant described an incident \nwhere he inappropriately obtained derogatory information about a supervisor by retrieving \ndocuments from a copy machine, confronted her with the information, and then shared it with a \ncolleague. At hearing, Applicant admitted he did not have the authority to view the documents or \nto disclose the information. Applicant also told the psychologist that, if Ms. H had a driver\u2019s \nlicense, he would access his state\u2019s database to check her status. Though his job, Applicant has \naccess to the state\u2019s database for drivers\u2019 licenses, but is not authorized to use it for personal use. \nApplicant testified that he does not believe he was manipulated or that he could be exploited.  \nApplicant repeatedly contradicted himself. He minimized, justified, and rationalized his conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of China and a permanent resident of the United States. She \nimmigrated in 1999, worked in the United States, and is now retired. She maintains a Chinese \npassport and returns to China about every two years to visit relatives. Applicant\u2019s father is a \nnaturalized citizen. Applicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are residents and citizens of China, and \nhis brother works for the Chinese government. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted in pertinent part. \nGuideline E \nApplicant does not grasp the gravity of his conduct. Through unsolicited emails, he \nestablished relationships with two women who told him obvious scam stories. He \nsent them money. He unwittingly participated in what is likely a money laundering \nscheme, but he still does not believe it despite transfer services blocking his account \ndue to potential fraud, and continues to have contact with this woman, even after \nbeing provided with an obvious fraudulent passport. He does not recognize how he \ncould be exploited by sending nude photos and sexually explicit videos of himself. \nHe believes his conduct of inappropriately obtaining derogatory information about \nhis supervisor, confronting her, and sharing it with a colleague was justified \nbecause of his high expectations for his supervisor. His willingness to access his \nemployer\u2019s database for his personal use is a concern. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is not minor or infrequent. He says he stopped communicating \nwith Ms. H as of his last email on January 7, 2022. It is obvious she was exploiting \nhim. . . . Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his reliability, judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. None of the mitigating conditions \napply.

None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. [Decision at 11.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in three regards. \nFirst, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to adhere to the procedures required . . . when \nshe failed to consider all relevant evidence submitted by Appellant.\u201d However, counsel cites to \nno evidence that the Judge failed to consider. \u201cThe appeal brief must state the specific issue or \nissues being raised, and cite specific portions of the case record supporting any alleged error.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.30. Applicant\u2019s counsel failed to comply with this fundamental requirement and \nfailed to carry his burden on this issue. \nSecond, Applicant argues that the Judge repeatedly interrupted Applicant\u2019s testimony, that \nshe asked questions \u201cnot posed by the department counsel or Applicant\u2019s lawyer and outside the \nscope of the direct examination,\u201d that she did not allow the Applicant to present his case, and that \nshe \u201ccreat[ed] her own bias against the Appellant.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. Applicant further contends \nthe interruptions and interjections establish that he \u201cwas not able to present evidence on [his] \nbehalf.\u201d Id. at 5-6. The transcript confirms that the Judge asked numerous questions during direct \nand cross examination. As the finder of fact, the Judge is required to issue a decision that sets \nforth findings of fact and conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25. In \nthis case, those allegations were wide-ranging and numerous. Our review establishes that the \nJudge, as permitted, questioned the Applicant to clarify ambiguities in his testimony, to better \nunderstand the evidence before her, and to facilitate the development of a more complete and \naccurate record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-1055 at 2 (App. Bd. May 8, 1996). Applicant was \nrepresented by counsel at the hearing. Near the end of the hearing, counsel was asked whether he \nhad anything further to present, and he responded in the negative. Tr. at 176. Our review of the \nentire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under the \nDirective to present his case.  \nTo the extent that Applicant is alleging bias, he cites to nothing in the record to support \nthis allegation, other than the curious assertion\u2014ungrounded in the Directive or controlling \nprecedent\u2014that the Judge asked questions outside the scope of direct examination. Applicant has \nfailed to rebut the presumption that the Judge was impartial and unbiased. See, e. g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThird, the remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in her whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching her decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nCarl Anthony Marrone, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 28, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 12, 2022, after close of the record, \nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged three delinquent debts and three foreclosures. The \nJudge found favorably for Applicant on the three delinquent debts and adversely to him on the \nthree foreclosures. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to disclose these \nsame financial issues on his March 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and that he \nsubmitted false information on a mortgage modification application in about 2015. The Judge \nfound adversely to Applicant on both Guideline E allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nOn appeal, Applicant raised the following issues: that the Judge was biased, that she \nmisapplied the Guideline F and E mitigating factors, that she permitted inquiry into matters not \nalleged on the SOR, and that she concluded that Applicant \u201cwas deliberately deceitful on his \ne-QIP and loan modification paperwork without any evidence to support this finding . . . .\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 5.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his late sixties, unmarried, with no children. He has a master\u2019s degree and \nover 40 years of experience in the defense industry.  \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nApplicant lives in a home that he purchased in 2000. During the real estate market \ndownturn of 2008, Applicant learned of an opportunity to purchase inexpensive out-of-state rental \nproperties as investments, with tenants and a property manager already in place. \nApplicant \npurchased three of these out-of-state rental properties and became a landlord. \nApplicant never personally saw or inspected the properties he purchased; he never met the \ntenants or reviewed their credit history; and he never met the property manager. Naive, Applicant \ndid not contemplate the risks involved in assuming the responsibility of being a landlord for out\u00ad\nof-state rental properties. \nIn 2008, the real estate market crashed, his tenants stopped paying the rent, and his property \nmanager quit. Applicant attended a real estate seminar where he met two men who offered to help \nhim with his out-of-state properties. Although the men were not licensed business advisors, \nApplicant trusted them, became friends, and accepted their help. One of the men (Friend) advised \nApplicant to default on his mortgages in order to force the note-holders to renegotiate more \nfavorable terms. Applicant paid the men two or three thousand dollars for their advice and \nfollowed it. \nIn 2013, the mortgage holders foreclosed on all three properties, as alleged in the SOR. \nPost-sale, the final judgment amounts ranged from approximately $55,000 to approximately \n$69,000. There is no documentation to confirm that Applicant is fully released from any of the \nthree foreclosure debts. \nApplicant has never indicated that he did not have the funds to pay the mortgages. Asked \nwhy he did not simply pay off the debt on the rental properties, Applicant explained that\u2014at the \ntime of default\u2014 he owed more than the properties were worth. \nDespite his issues with his initial three rental properties, Applicant continued to purchase \nadditional investment properties\u2014a fourth in 2008 and two more in 2012. He purchased the last \ntwo about the same time that he defaulted on the mortgages for his original three investments. \nApplicant continued to rely on Friend\u2019s real estate advice. As part of Friend\u2019s strategy to obtain \nloan modifications, Applicant filed a number of identity theft reports through the credit agencies, \nfalsely claiming that some of the mortgage accounts recorded under his name were not his. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2019, Applicant purchased an additional property, which consists of two land parcels he \nplans to develop into a 13-unit subdivision with a partner. He obtained a loan at 13% interest to \nmake the purchase, and he has a monthly payment of about $3,700.  \nApplicant stated that he has stopped enlisting the help of Friend because he now has all of \nthe loan modifications that he needs, to include one on his primary residence and one on a rental \nproperty. Applicant continues to associate with the acquaintances and friends whom he met \nthrough his real estate deals and who provided him with advice. \nApplicant stated that he is current with all of his regular monthly expenses and has no other \ndelinquent debt. He grosses about $10,000 a month from his employer. He also has a company \nretirement plan and other savings. After paying his regular monthly expenses, Applicant states \nthat he has money left over for discretionary expenses. He believes that his financial situation is \nunder control. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nIn 2015, Applicant applied for a mortgage modification and falsely claimed that he lived\u2014 \nor had lived\u2014 in the property securing the mortgage. Applicant stated that he did not intend to \ndefraud anyone, was relying on Friend\u2019s advice, and was unaware of what he was signing.  \nApplicant\u2019s explanation is not credible. Applicant knew exactly what he was doing \nwhen he signed the paperwork. His purpose was to obtain a loan modification and \nin order to obtain it, he needed to represent that he resided in the property, or the \nproperty would be considered an investment property, and the interest rate on the \nloan would automatically be higher. Applicant also admitted that he had filed a \nnumber of identity theft reports through the credit agencies saying that some of his \nmortgage accounts were not his, when in fact they were his mortgage accounts, in \norder to accomplish this loan modification. This is fraudulent. . . . To trust an \nunlicensed financial advisor\u2019s methodology to help him obtain his loan \nmodification shows poor judgment and unreliability. [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nApplicant completed his SCA in March 2018. In response to the questions concerning \njudgments and foreclosures within the past seven years and civil court actions within the past ten, \nApplicant \u201cdeliberately failed to disclose\u201d his delinquent debts and his three foreclosures. Id. \nat 7.    \nApplicant\u2019s excuse for not being truthful was that he was not familiar with \nthe terms of the questions that were being asked. . . . I do not find this explanation \ncredible. Applicant is an intelligent, well-educated engineer, who has worked for \ndefense contractors for over 40 years. He is expected to understand the questions \non the application. . . . Applicant was consistent in answering each of the three \nquestions in the negative. He knew or should have known how to read and \nunderstand the fairly simple questions on the application, and he should have been \ntruthful in answering them. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInstead, Applicant deliberately lied in response to the questions . . . on his \nsecurity clearance application. Within seven years of the application, he had \nallowed three of his out-of-state properties to go into foreclosure, he had \nstrategically defaulted on his mortgage for his primary residence, strategically \ndefaulted on a vacation home, and was delinquent on a line of credit owed to a \nbank. It is incomprehensible how his responses to the questions can be explained \nany other way. It is clear that he was deliberately not candid or truthful in his \nresponses on the application. [ Decision at 7. ]  \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for the period from 2009 through 2012 are highly \nfavorable. Witnesses and letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf attest to his \ngood character, diligence, and trustworthiness. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted in pertinent part below. \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n[Applicant] purchased three properties intending to make money on his investment.  \nWhen the housing market crashed, and his investment went \u201csouth,\u201d he found a \nway to avoid the issue. He did not want to bear the burden of the decreased value \nof the properties, and so he defaulted on his contractual obligations and allowed the \nbanks to assume the loss. He defaulted on three mortgage loans, and a line of credit. \nInstead of immediately getting out of the market, like a prudent person would do \nafter such a devastating experience, he continued to invest and purchased more \nproperties. He also continued to rely on the same people who advised him wrongly \nin the first place. By scrutinizing the timeline, Applicant was actually purchasing \nmore properties while the out-of-state properties were going into foreclosure. His \nconduct was reckless, na\u00efve, and dangerous. He was using scandalous tactics to \nobtain loan modifications to avoid conventional mortgage rates. Applicant has \nalways had sufficient financial resources available to him to pay his mortgages, but \nchose to allow them to go into foreclosure. . . . He has shown poor judgment, \nunreliability, and untrustworthiness. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n[Decision at 10\u201311.] \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nApplicant obtained a mortgage modification with an application that falsely \nstated that he lived in the property or had lived there prior to being displaced. This \nwas not true. Applicant did not live in the property, and in fact obtained the \nmodification for an investment property he owned. Applicant also deliberately \nconcealed his derogatory financial history on his security clearance application. \nThere is no excuse for this dishonesty. Deliberately concealing material \ninformation from the government on a security clearance application raises serious \nquestions about one\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. [Decision at 12.] \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n---\nDiscussion \nBias \nIn his appeal brief, counsel for Applicant alleges that the Judge demonstrated hostility \ntowards Applicant during the hearing, was not impartial, and was predisposed to find adversely. \nWe do not find that argument convincing. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is \nimpartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of \npersuasion. The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was biased or \nprejudiced against Applicant. Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any indication the \nJudge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and \nimpartiality of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022). \nApplicant\u2019s counsel cites two examples of purported bias. In the first, the Judge interrupted \ncross-examination and admonished Applicant to be candid in his response.  The transcript reveals \nthat Department Counsel was asking Applicant whether he or Friend filled out his applications for \nloan modifications and that Applicant was vague and arguably evasive in his response. The Judge \ninterjected at that point.  She stated\u2014at some length\u2014that she was confident Applicant knew the \nanswer and admonished him to \u201ccome clean and . . . answer [Department Counsel\u2019s] question.\u201d \nTr. at 80. Applicant then admitted that he filled out the applications. Id. at 81. In the second \nexample, Applicant testified that the three out-of-state rental properties went to foreclosure. The \nJudge interrupted cross-examination to clarify, as she recalled reviewing documents that stated \notherwise\u2014that Applicant had disposed of the properties via short sales or a deed in lieu. The \nJudge questioned Applicant\u2019s counsel to determine who had provided the earlier contradictory \ninformation (i.e., Applicant or his counsel) and to resolve whether the properties were in fact \nforeclosed upon. In the ensuing dialogue, Applicant and his attorney confirmed that Applicant \nhad provided the erroneous information when responding to Government interrogatories. Id. at \n98\u201399. \nCounsel now argues that he and Applicant \u201cshould not have had to answer these accusatory \nquestions\u201d and that the \u201cfact that these questions were asked, at all, demonstrates that [Applicant] \ndid not receive a fair and impartial hearing.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. We are not persuaded. The Judge \nis the finder of fact. In both examples cited by Applicant\u2019s counsel, the Judge was attempting to \nresolve factual issues central to the SOR allegations. In the first instance, Applicant was not \nresponding to direct questions posed by Department Counsel. In the second instance, Applicant \nwas providing testimony directly at odds with his own prior representations of record. The Judge\u2019s \nefforts to resolve these factual issues were well within her authority. Although the Judge may have \nspoken sharply to Applicant and his counsel, we find nothing in her comments or in the Decision \nto suggest that she had an inflexible predisposition to render an adverse holding.  To the contrary, \nthe Judge found for Applicant on three allegations under Guideline F. The examples cited by \nApplicant do not rise to the level that might lead a reasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s \nimpartiality, nor do they rebut the presumption that the Judge ultimately decided the case on the \nrecord evidence.  Applicant has not met his heavy burden of persuasion that the Judge was biased \nagainst him.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDue Process \nOver objection by Applicant\u2019s counsel, the Judge permitted Department Counsel to inquire \ninto Applicant\u2019s gambling habits, which were not alleged on the SOR. Applicant now argues that \nDepartment Counsel violated Applicant\u2019s due process rights and that the Judge \u201cacquiesced\u201d to \nthis violation. \nAppeal Brief at 10. \nWithout notice to Applicant, counsel argues, \u201cit is \nimpermissible to expect him to be prepared to address any additional Guideline F concerns . . . \nthat were not included in his SOR.\u201d Id. at 9. First, we note that Department Counsel\u2019s questions \narose from bank statements (Applicant Exhibit M) Applicant submitted that reflected payments to \nbetting agencies. Second, we note that Department Counsel\u2019s questioning did not reveal gambling \nissues of security significance and that the Judge did not reference gambling issues in her decision.  \nFinally, we note that a Judge is required \u201cto examine the totality of an applicant\u2019s financial history \nand circumstances\u201d when considering Guideline F security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). Applicant\u2019s gambling habits, as reflected on a document \nthat he submitted, are part of his financial circumstances and subject to inquiry by Department \nCounsel to determine what role, if any, gambling played in Applicant\u2019s complicated financial \nhistory. We find no due process violation and determine this assignment of error to be without \nmerit. \nMens Rea \nApplicant denies that he intentionally omitted the adverse financial information from his \n2018 SCA and denies that he deliberately submitted false information on his 2015 loan application. \nInstead, Applicant says each was a \u201csimple mistake.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. Through counsel, \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in determining that Applicant acted intentionally as \u201cthe \nrecord is completely devoid of evidence that he acted with deliberation.\u201d Id. at 9. \nWe examine a Judge\u2019s findings to see if they are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as \na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. A controverted falsification allegation \nrequires a Judge to make a finding as to an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the alleged \nfalsification occurred, in light of the record as a whole. As a practical matter, such a finding may \noften rely on circumstantial evidence, rather than on an applicant\u2019s statements concerning his \nintent. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05850 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2013). \nHere, the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s intelligence, his advanced level of education, and \nhis 40 years\u2019 of experience in the defense industry in concluding that Applicant understood the \n\u201cfairly simple questions\u201d on the SCA and that he \u201cdeliberately lied\u201d in response to them. Decision \nat 7. She determined that any explanation other than deliberate deceit was \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d in \nlight of the fact that he had \u201cstrategically defaulted\u201d on two mortgage loans and allowed three \nproperties to go to foreclosure. Id. at 7.  \nWe also note the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination and defer to it. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1. In arriving at her adverse determination, the Judge considered that Applicant submitted \n\u201ca number of fraudulent identity disputes . . . to contest mortgage accounts that he knew were his \nown.\u201d Decision at 13. Although not alleged in the SOR, she determined that this \u201cevidence of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunscrupulous conduct\u201d was \u201cdirectly related to his credibility.\u201d Id. We conclude that the \nchallenged findings with regard to deliberate deception are supported by substantial evidence. \nMisweighing the Evidence and Misapplying the Mitigating Conditions \nApplicant contends the Judge improperly analyzed the evidence, under-emphasizing the \nfavorable evidence and over-emphasizing the unfavorable evidence. In his arguments, Applicant \nhighlights his long-term employment in the defense industry and the absence of any security \nviolations. He attributes his financial problems to his naivet\u00e9 and his reliance on advisors who \nproved to be \u201cfraudsters.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6 and 7. In a similar vein, Applicant argues that the \nJudge failed to apply the mitigating conditions properly. In essence, these portions of Applicant\u2019s \nbrief argue for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence, which is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are erroneous. Applicant has not rebutted the \npresumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he shown the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the evidence. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Applicant \ninitially requested a decision on the written record but later requested a hearing. On September \n20, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 11 delinquent debts totaling about $26,600. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant denied two debts and admitted the others. The Judge found in \nfavor of Applicant on one debt and against him on the others, including the two debts he denied. \nIn her decision, the Judge stated:  \nOnly recently did [Applicant] begin to address the debts when he realized that his \nsecurity clearance and employment were in jeopardy. He did not present sufficient \nevidence to meet his burden of proof. . . . Applicant failed to submit evidence that \nany payments or continuous payments have been made that demonstrate an \nestablished history of good faith payments on the delinquent debts. [Decision at 7 \nand 8.] \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s finding of fact. Instead, \nhe requests the Judge\u2019s decision be remanded so that he can present additional evidence showing \ndebts have been resolved. He states these debts were resolved before his hearing, but he had not \nreceived documentation from creditors showing their resolution. Being unable to provide such \ndocumentation, he argues \u201cput [him] in the position of \u2018proving a negative\u2019 at the hearing.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 9. We find no merit in his request to reopen the record so the Judge can consider new \nevidence.   \nA period of over seven months transpired between the issuance of the SOR and the hearing, \nwhich was held on July 13, 2021. At the hearing, Applicant was provided the opportunity to \npresent evidence, including documents showing resolution of the alleged debts. The Judge kept \nthe record of the proceeding open for a month after the hearing to provide Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents. Tr. at 126-128; Decision at 1-2. Upon Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, the Judge granted a continuance to September 10, 2021, to submit documents. Decision \nat 2. He submitted additional documents that were accepted into the record. In her decision, the \nJudge noted the record closed on September 10, 2021. Id. The record does not reflect that \nApplicant requested another extension of time beyond that date for him to submit additional \ndocuments. \nAbsent a showing of harmful error that affects a party\u2019s right to present evidence in the \nproceedings below, a party does not have any right to have a second chance at presenting its case \nbefore a Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2001). To the extent a \nparty fails to present evidence for consideration by the Judge, the party waives the opportunity to \nhave such evidence considered. Id. A party is not entitled to have the case reopened to allow the \nintroduction of evidence that comes into existence after the close of the record. As the Supreme \nCourt has noted: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative consideration of evidence . . . always creates a gap between the time \nthe record is closed and the time the administrative decision is promulgated [and, \nwe might add, the time the decision is judicially reviewed]. . . . If upon the coming \ndown of the order the litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because \nsome new circumstance has arisen, some new trend has been observed, or some \nnew fact discovered, there would be little hope that the administrative process could \never be consummated in a order that would not be subject to reopening. [Vermont \nYankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Counsel, Inc., 435 U.S. \n519, 554-555 (1978), quoting ICC v. Jersey City, 322 U.S. 503, 514 (1944)]. \nThe burden was on Applicant to present mitigating evidence to the Judge before the record \nclosed. The reasons why documents were not available for submission prior to the record\u2019s closure \ndoes not establish any error on the part of the Judge. It is well settled that, absent a showing that \nan applicant was denied a reasonable opportunity to prepare for the hearing or was denied a \nreasonable opportunity to present evidence on his or her behalf, an applicant is not entitled to have \nthe record reopened just so he or she can have another chance to present evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-03347 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2016). See also ISCR Case 00-0250 at 4 (\u201cIf the Board \nwere to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a new hearing or allow her to submit new evidence in this \ncase, then the Board would be giving her special treatment and denying other, similarly-situated \napplicants of their right to receive the fair, impartial, and even-handed application of Executive \nOrder 10865 and the Directive.\u201d). In this case, Applicant has not shown the Judge or the \nGovernment denied him the opportunity to present evidence. His request to reopen the record so \nthat the Judge can consider new evidence does not establish any harmful error that would justify \nsuch a remand.  \nApplicant also argues the Judge erred in concluding he failed to mitigate the alleged \nsecurity concerns and in her application of the whole-person concept. These arguments amount to \na disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that the \nJudge\u2019s analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nMark S. Zaid, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 2, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  \nApplicant requested a hearing. On October 13, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran granted Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance. Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2014 \nto at least October 2020, that he purchased marijuana from about May 2014 to approximately mid\u00ad\n2020, and that he intends to continue to use marijuana in the future.  In responding to the SOR on \nJanuary 21, 2021, Applicant admitted each SOR allegation with comments, including that, upon \nlearning the seriousness with which the Federal Government views marijuana, he has decided to \ndiscontinue using or purchasing marijuana in the future. The Judge found in favor of Applicant \non all of the allegations. \n\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Consistent with the following discussion, we reverse \nthe Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his forties and has been working for a defense contractor for about 14 years. \nHe is married with children. He has earned an associate\u2019s degree and has taken additional college \ncourses. This is his first request for a security clearance. Witnesses and documents attest to his \nexcellent work performance and character. Among other favorable personal traits, he is praised \nfor his reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. \nDuring the alleged period, Applicant lived in two states. In the first state, marijuana use \nwas legal under state law. While living there, Applicant\u2019s wife successfully used marijuana to \ntreat an illness. On a doctor\u2019s recommendation, Applicant used marijuana in the forms of edibles, \nrubs, and vapes for insomnia and pain management. At that time, he knew marijuana was an illegal \ncontrolled substance under Federal law. In the second state, marijuana use was permitted for \nmedicinal purposes. After moving there, he initially used rubs, but not edibles or vapes. Upon \nreceiving a card from the state\u2019s cannabis commission, he vaped marijuana. When the second \nstate made recreational use of marijuana legal, he no longer needed a card to purchase or use \nmarijuana in that state.  \nIn his April 2020 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed his marijuana \nuse and noted he intended to continue to use it, as necessary, for insomnia and pain management.  \nAbout a month later, he fully discussed his marijuana use in a background interview. He indicated \nthat, although he was aware marijuana was illegal under Federal law, he was following the state\u2019s \napproach. In responding to interrogatories, he again indicated he planned to use marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes. He did not understand the full ramifications of his use of marijuana until he \nreceived the SOR and discussed it with his attorney. He last purchased marijuana in December \n2020 and last used it in January 2021. Applicant is now aware that individuals eligible for security \nclearances cannot engage in such conduct.   \nApplicant credibly testified that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. His wife \nhas also stopped using marijuana for medicinal purposes to support him.  Both are pursuing other \ntreatments for their health issues that do not involve marijuana. In August 2021, a licensed clinical \nsocial worker evaluated Applicant and concluded he did not meet the criteria for cannabis use \ndisorder. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug use, acknowledging any \nfuture use would be grounds for revoking his security clearance.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nMarijuana use is prevalent and accepted in significant segments of our society. \u201cI do not \ncite these facts because I condone marijuana use; I do not. I cite them to provide context to the \nworld Applicant lived in when he made the decision to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and \nwhy it took so long for him to stop.\u201d  Decision at 5-6.

See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \nAfter issuance of the Judge\u2019s decision, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications.1 It \nstates in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The SecEA has \nprovided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies that requires them to use \na \"whole-person concept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's behavior raises a \nsecurity concern, if at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the individual \ncan demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation \nor other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing federal \nlaw and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or \n1 \u201c[A]n applicant\u2019s security eligibility must be adjudicated under current DoD policies and standards, not past ones.\u201d \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3, n.2 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). This principle applies not only to changes to \nthe Directive that occur during an adjudication but also to the issuance of any clarifying guidance by appropriate \nauthorities. Because the recent clarifying guidance does not apply a more restrictive interpretation of the adjudicative \nguidelines pertinent in this case, there is no need to remand the decision to the Judge to consider the new guidance.  \n3 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nholding a security clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once the \nindividual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.2 \nEven under this new clarifying guidance, Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to raise security \nconcerns that have not been mitigated. In this regard, we find persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s \nargument that the Judge failed to consider important aspects of the case. We note the following \nevidence drawn from the record: \n1. Before beginning his use of marijuana for medical purposes at the age of 36, \nApplicant conducted research and learned such use was illegal under Federal law. \nTr. at 75, 80-81. \n2. Applicant testified that physicians cannot prescribe marijuana because it is \nillegal under Federal law, but they can recommend its benefits. Tr. at 79 and 84\u00ad\n85. \n3. Regarding the security clearance process, Applicant testified that he did not \ninitially believe his marijuana use would be disqualifying.  He stated that he talked \nto friends and coworkers who advised him \u201cas long as you\u2019re honest in the process \nthat you could still maintain and achieve a security clearance.\u201d Tr. at 76. However, \nhe never talked to a supervisor, facility security officer, or anyone in authority at \nhis company about implications of using marijuana on security clearance eligibility.  \nTr. at 92-93. \n4. In August 2019, Applicant applied for a position of trust at a Federal agency, \ncompleted a Standard Form 85, and was required to take a drug test.  He could not \nremember whether that form contained questions about marijuana usage.3 Tr. at 72 \nand 94-95.  \n5. In April 2020, Applicant completed a SCA. Section 23\u2015Illegal Use of Drugs \nor Drug Activity\u2015of the application states: \u201cThe following questions pertain to the \nillegal use of drugs or controlled substance or drug or controlled substance activity \nin accordance with Federal laws, even though permissible under state laws.\u201d He \ndisclosed he used marijuana from May 2014 to the month of the SCA\u2019s submission. \nGE 1 at 43.  \n2 Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of \nPersons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated \nDecember 21, 2021 (SecEA Clarifying Guidance), at page 2.  \n3 Revisions of Standard Form 85 in September 1995, December 2013, and December 2017 contain sections asking \napplicants if they used illegal drugs, including marijuana, in either the last year or last seven years depending upon \nthe revision used.    \n4 \n\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n6. In May 2020, Applicant participated in a security clearance interview.  A major \nfocus of that interview was his drug involvement. During the interview, he stated \nhe knew his conduct was illegal under Federal law, but he had adopted the state\u2019s \napproach.  GE 2 at 4 and Tr. at 80-81. \n7. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that she also was interviewed as part of his background \ninvestigation. She stated that \u201c[t]he investigator asked me more than once about \nhis marijuana use, that was one of the first times I realized, that could be an issue.\u201d \nTr. at 59. \nOn cross-examination, she acknowledged that the investigator\u2019s \nquestions about her husband\u2019s marijuana use raised \u201cred flags\u201d and that she \ndiscussed the matter with her husband. Tr. at 67-68. \n8. In October 2020, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. The primary \nfocus of the interrogatories was his drug involvement. It contains five pages of \nquestions asking him about his drug involvement. In responding to those questions, \nApplicant indicated he used marijuana \u201c[d]aily in the evening as necessary.\u201d \nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 9. \n9. Applicant\u2019s wife testified he informed her that he received interrogatories related \nto his drug usage and, at that time, expressed concern that such conduct might not \nbe consistent with holding a security clearance. After discussing this matter, they \ndecided he should continue to use marijuana.  Tr. at 69-70. \n10. On December 2, 2020, the SOR was issued. It stated that the Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility was \u201cunable to find it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant [Applicant] access to classified information\u201d due to his drug \ninvolvement and that his case would be submitted to a Judge for a determination as \nto whether he should be granted a security clearance.  SOR at 1. \n11. Applicant testified that he first learned his marijuana use would be a problem \nwhen he received the SOR.  Tr. at 75-76. \n12. Applicant testified that he continued to use marijuana for about six weeks after \nreceiving the SOR.  Tr. at 76. \n13.

He continued to purchase and use \nmarijuana after applying for a security clearance and after being adequately placed on notice that \nsuch conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. In doing so, Applicant not only \nknowingly violated Federal drug laws but also disregarded security clearance eligibility standards. \nThis behavior raises substantial questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJan. 15, 2019). Viewed as a whole, his conduct raises eligibility concerns, such as poor judgment, \nthat are broader than his marijuana use.  Applicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in \nthe future does not fully address the scope of these security concerns. Nor does the passage of a \nlittle more than six months between his last use of marijuana and the hearing eliminate those \nconcerns. \nFrom our review of the record, security concerns persist regarding Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with security requirements. The Judge erred in \nfailing to address these important aspects of the case.  \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and \ncapricious. It is not sustainable as it fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs \ncontrary to the weight of the record evidence. Furthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, \nviewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan \nstandard. \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPhillip Stackhouse, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 20, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handing Protected Information), \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 30, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline K, the SOR alleged that, while employed by a defense contractor, \nApplicant deliberately downloaded files containing protected information onto a personal external \ndevice in about 2018. This single allegation was cross-alleged as the only allegation under \nGuidelines M and E.

The Judge found against Applicant on the three SOR allegations. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government met its burden \nof proof, whether the Judge erred in his credibility determination and findings of fact, whether the \nJudge was biased against Applicant, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his thirties, has earned two master\u2019s degrees and a Ph.D.  In 2007, he \nbegan working for a defense contractor (Company A) in the information technology field and was \ngranted a security clearance. In 2018, he accepted a position with his current employer and notified \nCompany A of his intent to resign. On his last day of work at Company A in August 2018, \nApplicant downloaded over 15,000 files onto a personal USB drive. Applicant took the USB drive \nwith him when he departed the company. A few days later, Company A noticed Applicant\u2019s \nunusual downloading activity just prior to his final departure and began an investigation. \nIn September 2018, Applicant signed a Company A memorandum that advised him he \nviolated the company\u2019s policies by downloading files onto his personal USB drive without \nauthorization. As instructed, he returned the USB drive to Company A. The company later issued \nan internal memorandum that revealed over 15,000 files totaling over 8 gigabytes were recovered \nfrom the USB drive. The memorandum further indicated \u201cAllegation: Data Exfiltration with \nCI/CT [Counterintelligence/Counter Terrorism] nexus (SUBSTANTIATED)[.]\u201d Decision at 3, \nciting Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 1.  In October 2018, an adverse information report was filed \nagainst Applicant. \nIn a 2019 background interview, Applicant initially denied he had previously misused \ninformation technology before being confronted with Company A records reflecting he was \nineligible to be rehired due to the downloading incident. During that interview, he admitted that \nhe accidentally downloaded Company A proprietary information while attempting to download \nhis personal files. At the hearing, he claimed the interview was the first time he learned Company \nA considered the downloading of the files improper activity. He testified at his hearing that he \nhad Company A\u2019s approval to transfer files using a USB drive between the company\u2019s two \nnetworks and that the company did not require him to use an approved USB drive. He further \ntestified that he used his company laptop for both work and personal purposes. He acknowledged \nthat he was aware he could not take Company A proprietary information when he resigned from \nthe company. He attributed this downloading mistake to haste in retrieving his personal files.  \nThe nature, extent, and seriousness of his conduct speaks for itself. The fact \nthat he did not seek his employer\u2019s prior approval to copy files onto the USB Device \nstrongly suggests that he knew that such approval would be denied or highly \nsupervised. I also found Applicant\u2019s testimony and demeanor while testifying to \nlack credibility on the issue of whether his actions of copying thousands of files \nfrom his employer\u2019s computer network, some of which contained [Company A \nproprietary information], was inadvertent. I conclude Applicant knew better and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nwas seeking to do something without his employer\u2019s approval while hoping he was \nacting \u201cunder the radar\u201d of his employer in the afternoon of his very last day of \nwork there. \nUnfortunately for Applicant, [Company A\u2019s] computer system \ndetected his unusual activity of downloading of large number of files, and an \ninvestigation \nensued. \n[Company \nA] \ninvestigators \nfound \nthat \ntheir \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism concerns were substantiated. [Decision at \n13-14.] \nSome mitigating conditions were partially established; others were not established.  \nApplicant failed to mitigate the alleged security concerns. Overall, the record evidence raises \ndoubt about Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.  \nDiscussion \nDeliberate Downloading of Files and Credibility Determination \nA central theme running throughout Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is that the Judge erred in \nconcluding that Applicant deliberately downloaded the files in question. As a related matter, he \nalso claims the Judge\u2019s credibility determination is flawed. These arguments are not persuasive.  \nApplicant contends that the downloading of Company A\u2019s protective information onto his \npersonal USB drive was inadvertent1 and that insufficient evidence exists to show otherwise. The \nJudge did not accept those claims. It is well established that circumstantial evidence may prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time he or she engaged in a certain act. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02592 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). See also, DISCR OSD Case No. 90-0095 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. Jan. 14, 1991) (circumstantial evidence may be as probative as direct evidence). The entire \nrecord should be examined in making a state-of-mind determination. The relevant factors to \nconsider in making such a determination, of course, depend upon the facts of the case, but \nfrequently include an applicant\u2019s age, education, position, experience, as well as the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct in question, the circumstances surrounding that conduct, and the \nplausibility of an applicant\u2019s explanation regarding it.   \nIn this case, pertinent facts support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s downloading \nof the files was deliberate. First, the downloading at issue occurred on Applicant\u2019s last day of \nemployment at Company A. Understandably, an employee\u2019s downloading of a large number of \nfiles just prior to walking out the door for the last time raises concerns. Another significant fact in \nthis case is Company A\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s use of the personal USB drive violated its \npolicies.

[GE 3 at 2.] \nConversely, Applicant contends that he was authorized to transfer Company A files between \nnetworks using an external hard drive. Tr. at 22-28, 57-66, and 71-78. However, he has not \ncorroborated his claim that the company\u2019s authorization for him to use an external hard drive \nextended to him using a personal USB drive to transfer files from the company\u2019s computer system. \nId. During his testimony, he acknowledged he needed the company\u2019s permission to transfer his \npersonal files, although he claimed he was unaware of that requirement when he made the transfer. \nId. at 26-27. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s testimony, the above quote from the Company A \nmemorandum provided the Judge a sufficient basis to conclude Applicant was not authorized to \nconnect his personal USB drive into the company\u2019s computer system. In this regard, it merits \nnoting the Appeal Board gives deference to a company\u2019s findings and conclusions in its security \ninvestigations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018) (\u201c[B]ecause of \nthe unique position of employers as actual administrators of classified programs and the degree of \nknowledge possessed by them in any particular case, their determinations and characterizations \nregarding security violations are entitled to considerable deference, and should not be discounted \nor contradicted without a cogent explanation.\u201d). In this case, the Judge committed no error in \nrelying on Company A\u2019s report to conclude that Applicant\u2019s downloading of the files to his \npersonal USB drive violated the company\u2019s policies and that his misconduct was substantiated.    \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent or implausible statements regarding this incident \nundercut the believability of his claims. For example, his claim that he was unaware at the time \nthat his actions were in violation of company policy is dubious. Tr. at 26-27, Decision at 10, \nAppeal Brief at 12. The evidence reflects that he is highly educated and worked for Company A \nfor about 11 years. At that company, he held positions as a systems engineer and as an information \nassurance engineer. Tr. at 20 and GE 1 at 18. At the hearing, he testified that he was required to \nbe aware of how to use USB devices \u201cproperly or improperly[.]\u201d Tr. at 20. Given his background \nand experience as an information technology professional, he should have been well aware of the \ndangers involved in the downloading of files from the company\u2019s computer.  It was reasonable to \nexpect that a professional with his background would have taken appropriate steps to safeguard \nprotected information and to conclude that his downloading of the company\u2019s proprietary \ninformation was deliberate. As the Judge stated, \u201cEven a non-expert employee would readily \nunderstand the security risks presented by plugging a privately purchased USB device into the \nemployer\u2019s computer network and copying files without the employer\u2019s permission.\u201d Decision at \n13. \nIn challenging the Judge\u2019s credibility determination, Applicant notes that he wore a mask \nduring the hearing2 and refers to the Judge as a \u201chuman lie detector.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2, 11, and \n19. See also Tr. at 18-19. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 provides that the Appeal Board shall give \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination. Additionally, a party challenging a Judge\u2019s \ncredibility determination has heavy burden on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 \n2 The wearing of masks was required to protect against the spread of the COVID-19 virus. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). In this case, the Judge had the opportunity to personally observe \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor during his testimony despite the mask and to weigh his testimony in light \nof the record evidence as a whole. Key considerations in assessing credibility include whether the \nwitness\u2019s testimony is contradicted by other evidence or whether it is so internally inconsistent or \nimplausible on its face that a reasonable fact-finder would doubt it. \nIn addition to the \ncontradictions in Applicant\u2019s statements noted in the previous paragraphs, the Judge also noted \nthat Applicant initially denied during his background interview that he previously misused any \ninformation technology system despite having received Company A\u2019s memorandum regarding a \nviolation of its information technology policies. Furthermore, although documentary evidence \nconfirmed that he was informed of those violations prior to his background interview, he continued \nto claim at the hearing that the background interview was the first time he learned Company A \nconsidered the downloading of the files as improper conduct.  Tr. at 38-40. \nRecord evidence supports the Judge\u2019s challenged conclusions. Applicant has failed to \nestablish the Judge\u2019s conclusion as to Applicant\u2019s intent or credibility determination were \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant contends the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not support by substantial evidence.  \nFor example, he points out the Judge erred in making a finding regarding the title of his position \nat Company A. Regarding this matter, the Judge apparently confused Applicant\u2019s most recent \nposition title with his former position title at Company A. GE 1 at 17-18. From our review of the \nrecord, Applicant has not cited any error in the Judge\u2019s findings that would likely affect the \noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nMitigating Conditions and Whole-Person Factors \nApplicant contends the Judge improperly assessed and weighed the evidence. He argues \nthe Judge erred in concluding that certain mitigating conditions did not apply or others only \npartially applied. He further asserts the Judge erred in assessing the whole-person factors. In \nmaking these arguments, Applicant highlights evidence supporting the application of those \nconditions or factors. These arguments are not convincing. The presence of some mitigating \nevidence does not compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier \nof fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence \noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not \nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that \nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n31, 2020). \nBias \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions denying him a security \nclearance were biased. Appeal Brief at 3, 6, 7, and 12. He also asserts the Judge\u2019s analysis, which \nhe claims was unsupported by facts, impugns his character. Appeal Brief at 9.

See, \ne.g., Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751 at 762 (10th Cir. 2010). There is a rebuttable presumption that \na Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy \nburden of persuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). Applicant \nhas not directed our attention to anything in the record that would likely persuade a reasonable \nperson that the Judge was lacking in the requisite impartiality.  \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted an exception under Directive, Encl. 2, App. C. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on \nthe record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 7, 2021, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On February 23, 2022, after considering the record, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Gregg A. Cervi denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant states that he understands how the Judge arrived at his conclusions. Indeed, he \nobserves that, given the evidence in the record, the Judge could only have issued an adverse \ndecision. We do not review cases de novo but must address only those issues of harmful error \nraised by the appealing party. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. If the appealing party has not raised issues of \nharmful error we affirm the Decision as it stands. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02330 at 2 (App. \nBd. Mar. 18, 2022).

Despite his apparent concession that the Judge\u2019s decision is understandable and \nsupportable, we construe other aspects of Applicant\u2019s brief as raising a possible due process issue \nand as challenging some aspects of the Judge\u2019s analysis. \nThe SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts totaling about $115,000. The Judge concluded that \nApplicant presented insufficient evidence to show that these debts had been resolved. Applicant \nstates that he did not give his case for mitigation \u201cthe proper attention and focus that [he] should \nhave.\u201d He states that he was not \u201ccounseled well\u201d and that he mistakenly believed that the matters \ncontained in the File of Relevant Material (FORM) would be sufficient to result in a favorable \ndecision.  Appeal Brief at 1. \nPrior to closure of the record, Department Counsel, by means of the FORM, provided \nApplicant with all of the evidence that supported the SOR. In addition, she accompanied the \nevidence by a written presentation placing Applicant explicitly on notice that he had not provided \ndocuments showing a meaningful track record of financial recovery. Applicant received the \nFORM on September 2, 2021. It was accompanied by a cover letter that also advised him of his \nrights and obligations to submit a response to the SOR allegations and cited to relevant provisions \nof the Directive regarding DOHA\u2019s adjudication process. Applicant had previously received a \ncopy of the Directive along with the SOR. After examining the record as a whole, we conclude \nthat Applicant received adequate notice of his right to submit evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n20-01217 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2021). If Applicant did not appreciate the gravity of his \ncircumstances, it was not due to any defect in the guidance that DOHA provided him. Although \npro se applicants are not expected to perform at the level of attorneys, they are required to take \nreasonable steps to protect their interests.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03689 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2018).  Applicant was not denied the due process rights afforded by the Directive. \nApplicant makes arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions and \nthe whole-person factors. Among other things, he contends that he did not wait until he had \nreceived the SOR to begin addressing his financial problems, as the Judge stated. He also notes \nthat he has held a clearance for many years without incident or concern. We have considered \nApplicant\u2019s arguments in light of the record. Applicant\u2019s good prior security record does not \nundermine the Judge\u2019s decision. Even those with clean records can experience circumstances in \nwhich their eligibility for access to classified information could be brought into question. The \nGovernment does not have to wait until a person actually compromises classified information in \norder to issue an adverse determination. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01949 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. \n14, 2021). Applicant\u2019s arguments viewed as a totality are not enough to show that the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 20-02818 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2022).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

She was medically retired \nfrom the U.S. military in 2016 and is a prospective employee of a defense contractor. The SOR \nalleged that Applicant failed to timely file her 2013\u20132017 federal income tax returns, and Applicant \nadmitted the sole allegation. \nIn 2016 or 2017, Applicant received a lump-sum inheritance of approximately $197,000, \nbut she did not use the funds to hire a tax professional to prepare her unfiled federal returns. She \nclaimed to interview several accountants but asserted that she could not afford their fees. Applicant \nused the inherited funds instead to cover bills that were in arrears, medical costs, and living \nexpenses.  The inheritance is now depleted.  \nAfter the SOR was issued in February 2021, Applicant hired a tax attorney to file all of her \nfederal returns from 2013\u20132020. In November 2021, she filed her 2014\u20132016 tax returns. In \nAugust 2022, Applicant filed her 2013 and 2017 tax returns. \nApplicant testified that her medical issues impacted her ability to complete her taxes.  She \nneeded help to file her federal tax returns and did not receive it. Applicant provided character \nletters from colleagues and former supervisors, including retired general officers. They attest to \nher trustworthiness and reliability and recommend that her clearance be continued. \nApplicant provided numerous reasons why she was unable to file for tax years 2013 \nthrough 2017 in a timely manner, to include: reserve duties, mobilization orders, long working \nhours, lack of access to her financial documents, medical issues leading to her medical retirement, \nand a period of homelessness. While several circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, \nsome of them were not. She chose not to hire a professional to assist her when she received her \ninheritance of almost $200,000 in 2016 or 2017.  \nShe finally acted to hire a tax professional in 2021 who filed her missing returns . . . \nafter the SOR had issued. Applicant\u2019s actions do not amount to responsible actions \nunder the circumstances. While it appears Applicant\u2019s missing 2013\u20132017 tax returns \nare all filed, they are all at least four years late and as much as eight years late.  \n[Decision at 6.] \nDiscussion \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant asserts that the Judge made his determination \u201cwithout \nactually having all the facts at his fingertips\u201d and provides additional information about the \ncircumstances that led to her financial issues. Appeal Brief at 1\u20132. The Appeal Board does not \nreview cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \nE3.1.29. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not give appropriate weight to her medical issues and \nher earlier efforts to resolve the tax situation.

On appeal, the Applicant raised the \nfollowing issue: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nFor the reasons stated below, we remand the decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in her mid-forties and has earned two associate\u2019s degrees. Now divorced, \nApplicant was married from 2003 to 2020 and has seven children. She retired from the U.S. \nmilitary in 2015 after a 21-year career. \nUpon retirement in 2015, Applicant and her then-husband (husband) opened a commercial \ncleaning business. Although the business was initially successful, it floundered after one of their \nlargest clients, the prime contractor on a military housing contract, failed to make timely payments \nand then stopped making payments altogether. Applicant and her husband struggled to pay their \nemployees and business expenses. Gradually, they fell behind on federal payroll taxes, state \nemployment taxes, and their personal debts. Prior to the failure of their business, Applicant had no \nfinancial problems. \nIn 2018, Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, listing \napproximately $87,000 of debts. As part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Applicant\u2019s house was \nsold at foreclosure. \nThe couple\u2019s financial problems caused stress in their marriage, and Applicant filed for \ndivorce in February 2020. The couple agreed to split the Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments, but \nApplicant\u2019s husband failed to make his share of the payments, leading to the dismissal of the \nbankruptcy plan, as alleged in the SOR. \nThe three delinquent consumer debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e are owed to the same \ncreditor. Applicant testified that two of the debts represent the same car loan. Subparagraphs \n1.d and 1.e are both auto loans opened on the same day with the same account number. \u201cI \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s contention . . . is substantiated.\u201d \nDecision at 3. \nAdditionally, \nApplicant contends that the three debts were her ex-husband\u2019s responsibility and that she was \nmerely an authorized user on the accounts. She submitted a credit report that indicates her \nresponsibility to pay them was terminated. Applicant referenced a divorce agreement that \ndesignated her husband as responsible for the debts, but she did not provide a copy of the \nagreement. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, totaling $45,000, represent delinquent Federal payroll taxes \nrelated to the failure of Applicant\u2019s business. Between 2016 and 2020, the IRS diverted \napproximately $17,000 of refunds due from Applicant\u2019s personal income tax to her business \ndelinquency. Applicant made two modest payments in 2021. When she contacted the IRS to \narrange a payment plan, the IRS rejected the request and placed the account in a non-collectible \nstatus after concluding that she did not have the disposable income to execute a payment plan at \nthis time. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted in pertinent part below: \nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay her debts on time was not caused by foolish or \nprofligate spending. Instead it stemmed from the failure of her business and her \nsubsequent divorce. In early 2021, a few months after her divorce was finalized, \nApplicant began attempting to contact creditors . . . These efforts are sufficient to \nmitigate subparagraphs 1.b and 1.f and to trigger the application of [two mitigating \nconditions]. I resolve subparagraphs 1.b and 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant successfully established that two of the three debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.c through 1.e were duplicates. However, her contention that she \nwas not responsible for their payment because her ex-husband was legally \nresponsible to pay them, per a separation agreement, was unsubstantiated absent \nrecord evidence of such an agreement. \n. \n. \n. \nShe has gotten off to a good start in satisfying her debts . . . However, the most \nsignificant debt, owed to the IRS, remains outstanding, and per an IRS agent, she \ndoes not currently have the means to initiate a viable payment plan. Consequently, \nalthough Applicant deserves credit for the steps she has made thus far to satisfy her \ndelinquent debts, there is not yet a significant enough track record of financial \nreform to conclude that she has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. [Decision at 6.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the \nlaw. In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we review the Judge\u2019s \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \nTurning first to the three consumer debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e, Applicant challenges \nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions in two regards. First, she highlights that one of the duplicate car loans \nshould have been resolved favorably for her. We agree. As we have previously stated, when the \nSOR alleges the same delinquent debt twice, as the Judge determined here, the Judge should find \nin favor of Applicant on at least one of those allegations.

Again, we agree. The Government submitted four credit reports: two pre-date the \nSOR (March 2020 and December 2020) and two post-date the SOR (September 2021 and April \n2022). The earlier two establish the debts owed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c\u20131.e, debts owed to the same \ncreditor on joint credit card and auto loan accounts. The two credit reports that post-date the SOR, \nhowever, indicate that Applicant was \u201cTerminated\u201d as an \u201cAccount Owner.\u201d GE 6 at 3\u20135; GE 7 \nat 6, 8. For all three accounts, the credit reports reflect balances of $0. Id. This is not a case in \nwhich the debts fell off a credit report or are barred by a statute of limitations. The Government\u2019s \nown exhibits affirmatively establish that\u2014sometime between the credit report of December 2020 \nand that of September 2021\u2014Applicant\u2019s responsibility for the debts was terminated. Assuming \narguendo that the Government established its prima facie case with regard to these debts, the debts \nare mitigated by evidence confirming that Applicant is no longer responsible for them. \nThe Judge\u2019s remaining adverse formal findings involve the Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ndismissal in June 2020 and the delinquent business tax debt owed to the Federal Government. In \nhis analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of conditions \nbeyond her control, i.e., the DoD prime contractor\u2019s failure to pay the company owned by \nApplicant and her ex-husband for services rendered and her ex-husband\u2019s failure to pay his share \nof the Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments. Those circumstances resulted in the failure of the \ncouple\u2019s business, the business tax deficiency, marital strife and the couple\u2019s divorce in late 2020, \nand the Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissal. In the decision, the Judge found \u201cApplicant had no \nfinancial problems before the business failed.\u201d Decision at 3. He also highlighted her efforts to \nresolve other debts. In this regard, we note that, with the exception of the debt alleged in SOR\u00b6 \n1.b for which the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor, her most recent credit report from April 2022 \nreflects no other delinquent debts. GE 7. It also merits noting that the IRS was listed as a creditor \nin the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, and the couple\u2019s home was sold in foreclosure as part of \nthat proceeding. GE 3 at 46; Decision at 3. Following dismissal of the bankruptcy, Applicant \nmade two payments totaling $390 towards the tax debt in 2021. AE G. At some point, Applicant \ncontacted the IRS to establish a repayment plan. \u201cHer request was rejected, and the account was \nplaced in non-collection status because the IRS agent concluded that she did not have enough \ndisposable income to execute a payment plan at this time.\u201d \nDecision at 4, citing Tr. at 48. \nIn his analysis, the Judge concluded that Mitigating Condition 20(g)1 did not apply to the \ntax debt because Applicant had no repayment plan for it. As quoted above, the Judge also noted \nthe IRS debt remained outstanding and concluded that, \u201calthough Applicant deserves credit for the \nsteps she made thus far to satisfy her delinquent debts, there is not yet a significant enough track \nrecord of financial reform to conclude that she has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns.\u201d Decision at 6. Based on our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s emphasis on a lack of \n1 See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(g), \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na track record of payments is misplaced. Given that Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose from \ncircumstances beyond her control and the IRS concluded she does not have the means to execute \na repayment plan, the key issue is whether she acted responsibly under the circumstances and, if \nso, whether the remaining security concerns are mitigated under Mitigating Condition 20(b).2 \nThe Judge has not explained what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that she has not already done to resolve either the Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissal \nor the business tax debt, or explain why the approach she has taken is not \u201cresponsible\u201d in light of \nthe circumstances presented in this case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 29, 2009). Put differently, the Judge has not stated a satisfactory explanation for his \nconclusion that these allegations remain unmitigated under Mitigating Condition 20(b). \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand the \ncase to the Judge to correct the identified errors. \nUpon remand, a Judge is required to issue a \nnew decision.

[Decision at 2.] \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis pertinent to this remand decision is summarized \nand quoted below: \nIn June 2017, Applicant used cocaine and marijuana one time each, establishing two \ndisqualifying conditions under the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG): AG \u00b6 25(a) any substance \nmisuse; and AG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent and over three years ago, both of his \nuses in June 2017 occurred when he was aware of his employer\u2019s drug-free policy and after he was \ngranted his 2008 security clearance. \nEven, if we believe he did not hold an active clearance in 2017, he was fully aware \nof his duties not to use illegal substances as an employee of this defense contractor, \nfrom his time holding an active clearance in 2008, and from his day holding an \nactive clearance in the [military]. For these reasons, AG \u00b6 26(a)1 does not fully \napply.  [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nI considered Applicant\u2019s negative drug tests, his written statement of intent \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future, his substance abuse evaluation conducted by \n1 AG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nMs. B, his military service, his education, his letters of recommendation, and his \njob performance appraisals and awards. However, I also considered that he used \nboth cocaine and marijuana in 2017, while holding a security clearance and while \nfully aware he was violating federal law and the no-drug policy of his employer. \n[Decision at 7.] \nDiscussion \nBackground \nOn appeal, Applicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s factual findings regarding the status of \nhis clearance and his ultimate adverse conclusion that Applicant used marijuana and cocaine in \nJune 2017 while granted access to classified information, as alleged in the SOR. Applicant asserts \nthat his clearance was deactivated when he transferred out of a classified program in September \n2009 and moved to a separate division of his company, where he has worked solely on an \nunclassified project. Therefore, he argues, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he used marijuana and \ncocaine while granted access to classified information is arbitrary and capricious. Based on the \nrecord before us, we concur that it is unclear from his decision how the Judge concluded that AG \n\u00b6 25(f) (any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information . . . ) was established. \nIn addressing Applicant\u2019s appeal issues, it is important to note the distinction between \npossessing a security clearance and being granted access to classified material. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information and the granting of access to classified information are not \nsynonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a security clearance is \na determination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national security information \nup to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an individual access to \nclassified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified materials, an individual must \nhave not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure \nagreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See Executive Order 13526, dated December 29, 2009, at \n\u00a7 4.1. While an eligibility determination is generally made at the agency level and is subject to \nvarious regulatory due process requirements; an access determination is most often made at the \nlocal level without any due process guarantees.  \nApplicant\u2019s Security Clearance Eligibility as of December 2021 \nThe Judge erred in finding that, based on a DISS document, Applicant continued to hold a \nsecurity clearance as of December 2021, and could access classified information at any time.2 To \nthe contrary, the DISS document, Government Exhibit (GE) 4 at 1, reflects: \u201cEligibility Level: \nNone[;] Eligibility Determination: None\u201d as of December 6, 2021. We interpret these entries as \nshowing that Applicant did not have security clearance eligibility on that date. As a result of this \nerror, it appears the Judge erroneously concluded Applicant held security clearance eligibility from \n2008 to late 2021. Because Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility is a key issue in this case \nand, as discussed below, there is conflicting evidence as to his eligibility status during the period \nat issue (June 2017), we are unable to conclude this error was harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013) (an error is harmless if it did not likely affect the outcome \n2 The Judge\u2019s finding at issue is quoted verbatim above in the section on the Judge\u2019s Finding of Fact. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nof the case). At this stage, it also merits noting we are unable to discern from the record evidence \nwhen Applicant lost his security clearance eligibility after being granted a security clearance in \nabout 2008. \nConflicting Evidence Regarding Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Status in June 2017 \nApplicant has consistently denied that he had a security clearance or access to classified \ninformation in June 2017. In his January 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed the June 2017 uses of \nmarijuana and cocaine. In response to the follow-up question\u2014\u201cWas your use while possessing a \nsecurity clearance?\u201d\u2014Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d for both uses. GE 1 at 32\u201334. In his background \ninterview of July 2019, he confirmed his reported June 2017 use of marijuana and cocaine and \nstated that he did not have a security clearance at the time. GE 3 at 2. In his December 2020 \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations that he used drugs while granted access, \nasserting that he did not have \u201can active security clearance\u201d and that he did not have access to \nclassified information in June 2017. SOR Answer at 1. At the hearing, Applicant presented a \nMarch 2021 email from his company\u2019s security manager indicating that he had a security clearance \nfrom August 2008 to October 2009 \u201cwhen he was downgraded as no longer requiring a clearance \nfor his job duties.\u201d Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) R at 1. In the fall of 2009, Applicant left the division \nof his company where he had access to classified information and moved to a different division in \nanother state for a position not requiring a clearance.  Tr. at 45\u201346. \nIn contrast, we note that\u2014although the SOR allegations were obviously controverted\u2014the \nGovernment submitted no evidence in its case-in-chief that Applicant had been granted access to \nclassified information in June 2017, as the SOR alleged. Instead, the Government\u2019s evidence in \nthe case, sent to Applicant in March 2021 and submitted to the Judge at hearing, consisted of \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 SCA (GE 1), a portion of his 2008 SCA (GE 2), and a summary of his July 2019 \nbackground interview (GE 3). Nothing in those documents substantiated the SOR allegations that \nApplicant had been granted access to classified information in June 2017 or even established that \nApplicant was eligible for access in June 2017, i.e., that he possessed a security clearance.  \nDuring Applicant\u2019s cross-examination, Department Counsel produced the DISS document, \na two-page print-out from Applicant\u2019s file dated December 6, 2021, which was 11 days prior to \nthe hearing. The Judge ultimately admitted the document during closing arguments. Tr. at 53\u2013 \n54. As noted above, the first page of the document reflects that Applicant did not hold a security \nclearance. The second page contains electronic notes from an unidentified source, entitled: \n\u201cAssignee Comments,\u201d dated June 1, 2020. In pertinent part, the comments read: \u201cSubject \nadmitted he used cocaine once in 2017 and [marijuana] in 2017. Subject said he did not have \naccess to classified at the time but [Joint Personnel Adjudication System] shows Subject was \ncleared on a [National Agency Check with Law and Credit] since 2008.\u201d GE 4 at 2. Nothing in \nGE 4 substantiates the SOR allegations that Applicant was granted access to classified information \nin June 2017. Moreover, the JPAS entry to which the adjudicator refers is not in evidence.  \nA Judge is responsible for resolving apparent conflicts in the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014). In doing so, the Judge should consider the \ncomparative reliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007).

See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0233 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb 14, 2001). See also Directive \u00b6 6.3 (\u201cEach \nclearance decision must be a . . . common sense determination based upon consideration of all the \nrelevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy . . . .\u201d). In \nconducting an analysis of this nature, the Judge should address not only the evidence supporting \nhis or her determination regarding the conflicting evidence, but also the evidence that fairly \ndetracts from that determination. \nIn this case, the only evidence supporting a determination that Applicant had security \nclearance eligibility in June 2017 was the unidentified assignee\u2019s comment in the DISS document. \nThat comment needed to be weighed against all the evidence supporting Applicant\u2019s claim that he \ndid not hold a clearance during that period. The Judge erred in failing to conduct such an analysis \nof the conflicting evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility in June 2017. \nVariance Between SOR Allegations and Record Evidence \nAlthough the Judge acknowledged that Applicant may not have had access to classified \ninformation in 2017,3 he did not directly address whether the notable disconnect between the SOR \nallegation and the evidence raised due process concerns. As discussed earlier, the record contains \nno evidence establishing that Applicant had, as alleged, access to classified information in June \n2017. In finding adversely to Applicant on the SOR allegations as written, a variance exists \nbetween the SOR allegations and the evidence. We are unable to determine how the Judge \nanalyzed this variance. \nA variance is material when the SOR allegation fails to serve as reasonable notice to an \napplicant of the concerns against him, thereby subjecting him to unfair surprise when confronted \nwith the Government\u2019s evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018). \nIf a variance exists, the Judge should determine whether it is material, i.e., does it create due \nprocess concerns. If such a variance is material, the Judge should take appropriate corrective \naction, which, depending on the nature of the variance, may include amending the SOR, granting \na continuance to address the discrepancy, reopening the record, etc.  In this case, the Judge should \nhave directly addressed the variance both at the hearing and in the decision and determined whether \nor not it was material.  \nConclusion \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand the \ncase to the Judge to correct the identified errors and for further processing consistent with the \nDirective. Upon remand, a Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The \nBoard retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued \nafter remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. Other issues in the \ncase are not ripe for consideration at this time. \n3 \u201cWhile Applicant may not have had current access to classified information, he continued to possess a security \nclearance and could have been granted access at any time.\u201d Decision at 2. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 7, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

In the Remand Decision dated August 31, 2022, the Judge \nagain found against Applicant on the two drug-use allegations and, in doing so, concluded \nApplicant neither had access to classified information nor held a security clearance at time of that \ndrug use.

The Judge \nconcluded: \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent and occurred over five years ago, \nhowever, there are two troubling aspects about his actions that go straight to the \nheart of his reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. First, when he revealed his 1999 use of marijuana in [his 2008 \nsecurity clearance application], he pledged not to use it again. He broke that pledge \nwith his 2017 use of marijuana and cocaine. Second, both of these uses were when \nhe was aware of his employer\u2019s drug-free policy. Even, if he did not hold a \nclearance in 2017, he was aware of his duties not to use illegal substances as an \nemployee of this defense contractor, from his time holding an active clearance in \n2008, and from his days holding an active clearance in the [military].  [Decision at \n7-8.] \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief disputes the Judge\u2019s assertions that Applicant used marijuana and \ncocaine in 2017 while granted access to classified information. Appeal Brief at 4. Applicant is \napparently misreading the Judge\u2019s decision. As noted earlier, the Judge made a finding that the \nGovernment did not produce sufficient evidence to establish that Applicant held a security \nclearance or had access to classified information during 2017. In his analysis, the Judge reiterated, \n\u201c[t]hese uses were not while he was holding a security clearance or when he was granted access to \nclassified information\u201d (Decision at 6) and concluded that Disqualifying Condition 25(f), \u201cany \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position,\u201d was \nnot established. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 25(f). This assignment of error is resolved \nadversely to Applicant because a plain reading of the Judge\u2019s decision simply does not support it. \nApplicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant\u2019s \u201clast use of illegal \nsubstances occurred less than three years ago.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4, citing Decision at 6. \nThis \nchallenged statement is from the Judge\u2019s first decision in this case that resulted in a remand. A \nremanded decision is vacated and becomes a legal nullity. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 90\u00ad\n0821 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 1991). Upon remand, the Judge is required to issue a new decision \nafter correcting identified errors. An error in a remanded decision cannot serve as a basis for error \nin the subsequent decision, which is a separate and distinct security clearance determination \nsubject to appeal.

Regarding this issue, Applicant also notes the Judge \nin the subsequent decision concluded, \u201cApplicant\u2019s marijuana use . . . occurred over five years \nago\u201d (Decision at 7), which comports with the record evidence.  \nIn the decision, the Judge indicated that he was treating Applicant\u2019s alleged use of illegal \ndrugs as an equivalent of a lessor included offense for notice and due process purposes and was \neffectively disregarding the portion of the SOR allegations that asserted the drug use occurred \n\u201cwhile granted access to classified information.\u201d Applicant argues the Judge\u2019s approach created \na material variance between the SOR allegation and the findings of fact and asserts he \u201cdid not \nhave a reasonable opportunity to respond\u201d to that variance.

Apr. 4, 2014) as supporting authority. In this case, the SOR \nallegations stated Applicant used marijuana and cocaine in 2017, which is the conduct that the \nJudge determined raised security concerns. Applicant was adequately placed on notice of the \nconduct at issue in this case. By disregarding the phrase \u201cwhile granted access to classified \ninformation\u201d in the SOR, the Judge effectively eliminated language that, if proven, could have \nraised additional security concerns under Disqualifying Condition 25(f). The Judge\u2019s action in \ndisregarding that language inured to Applicant\u2019s benefit. We fail to see how Applicant was \nprejudiced in any manner by the Judge noting he was disregarding language in the SOR allegations \nbecause the evidence did not support it. This assignment of error fails to establish any due process \nviolation. \nThe Judge found that Applicant regularly associates with the friend who provided him \nmarijuana. Decision at 3. Applicant challenges that statement by asserting he \u201ctestified that he no \nlonger associates with individuals whom he used the illegal substances with.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12, \nciting Tr. at 22. In this regard, Applicant testified that he had not seen the individuals who supplied \nhim with cocaine since that incident in 2017. Tr. at 21-22. However, record evidence establishes \nthat Applicant still associates with the friend with whom he used marijuana in 2017. Tr. at 43; \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 at 16 and 17 (security clearance application); GE 3 at 2 (summary of \nbackground interview). Applicant testified their continuing association involves \u201cother activities.\u201d \nTr. at 43.  This assignment of error establishes no harmful error.  \nApplicant contends the Judge erred by not considering all of the record evidence and by \nnot applying properly the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. He argues, for \nexample, the Judge did not consider that he avoids the environment where he used drugs, that his \ndrug use was not serious based on its nature and extent, that a qualified medical professional \ndetermined he needed no treatment, that he signed a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in \nthe future, and that he now understands the repercussions of his legal drug use. \nNone of his \narguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nApplicant also relies on a number of hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline H cases \nto argue the Judge erred in his analysis of this case.  His reliance on those hearing-level decisions \nis not persuasive. As the Board has previously stated, how particular fact scenarios in other cases \nwere decided at the hearing level are generally not a relevant consideration in our review of another \ncase. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021), setting forth a lengthier \ndiscussion of this issue. In short, Applicant\u2019s arguments based on favorable hearing-level \ndecisions in cases involving different applicants and different facts do not establish that the Judge\u2019s \nconclusions and analysis in this case are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 15, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On April 11, \n2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Gregg A. Cervi denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about 1993 to \nabout 2019 and used cocaine from about 2008 to about 2019. Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged \ntwo DUI arrests, the first in 2004 and the second in 2017. Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-\nalleged the Guideline G and H allegations and separately alleged an arrest for trespassing in 2015 \nand a domestic battery in 2016.

The Judge found \nadversely to Applicant on all allegations. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his mid-forties and currently employed as a laborer. He has previously \nworked as a security officer and in executive protection (bodyguard) positions for various \ncompanies. As an independent contractor, Applicant continues to work as a bodyguard. Divorced \nfrom his first wife, he remarried in February 2022.  \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana regularly from 1993 to 2019. He purchased it \napproximately twice per month from 1998 to 2016 and approximately once per month from 2016 \nto 2019. In response to Government interrogatories of January 2021, Applicant adopted the \nsummary of his personal subject interview (PSI) that was conducted in December 2019 and \ndeclared its accuracy. In that interview by a Government investigator, applicant denied purchasing \nmarijuana.  \nApplicant testified that he used cocaine about once every six months from 2008 to 2019, \nbut also testified that he only used cocaine three to four times. In his PSI, he stated that he used \ncocaine with his ex-wife weekly to quarterly while at nightclubs. During this period of illegal drug \nuse, Applicant worked in security and bodyguard positions, purchased firearms, and held a \nconcealed firearm permit. Applicant testified that he stopped using marijuana and cocaine in \nJanuary 2019, in part as a new year\u2019s resolution. Applicant has submitted a notice of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement.  \nIn 2004, Applicant was arrested for DUI, convicted, and placed on probation.  In 2017, he \nwas again arrested for DUI and having an open container of alcohol after he drove into a tree.  He \nrefused a breathalyzer test and ultimately was found guilty of having an open container of alcohol. \nIn 2015, Applicant was charged with trespassing.  He testified that he was at a casino, had \na disagreement with a card dealer and management, and refused to leave when directed to do so. \nDuring his PSI, Applicant stated that he was drinking while playing, without incident, and that he \nwas unfairly asked to leave. \nIn 2016, his then-wife reported Applicant to the police, accusing him of assaulting her on \ntwo occasions while they were visiting family out of state. Additionally, she described an incident \nin which he assaulted her, then drew his firearm, pointed it at himself, and threatened to kill \nhimself. Applicant admitted that he was drinking on that evening and confirmed the firearm \nincident, but denied assaulting her on that occasion or any other.  \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf, as did a relative of his wife who serves in \nthe military. Neither was aware of the SOR allegations. Applicant also submitted character letters \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nthat attest to his work ethic, positive attitude, and reliability. Neither letter mentioned specific \nSOR allegations. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant has a long history of illegal drug use. Despite his statement of intent to refrain \nfrom further drug use, he has not shown sufficient evidence of disassociation, a changed \nenvironment, or action to overcome his drug use history. He continues to work bodyguard \ncontracts, which appear to be the environment in which he used drugs before. None of his \nwitnesses were able to discuss his past drug use or any changes he may have made to his lifestyle. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use while working in security positions and carrying a firearm is cause \nfor concern. Additionally, Applicant falsely denied purchasing marijuana in his background \ninterview. \u201cWhile not alleged in the SOR, this conduct may be considered to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable, to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or \nchanged circumstances, or as part of a whole person analysis.\u201d Decision at 8. \nApplicant has two alcohol related driving incidents. His involvement in an argument with \nhis former spouse after drinking, drawing a firearm and threatening to kill himself, a trespassing \narrest after drinking, and his alleged spousal abuse are not alleged in the SOR under this guideline. \nHowever, this conduct may be considered to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is \napplicable, to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstance, or as part of \na whole\u2013person analysis. \u201cI have considered Applicant\u2019s conduct where alcohol was involved to \nany degree for these limited purposes.\u201d Decision at 9. Based on his alcohol-related driving \noffenses and the other incidents where alcohol was involved, significant doubts remain about his \njudgment.  \nI found his testimony to be at times elusive, evasive, and unconvincing, especially \nwhen it involved allegations of spousal abuse, and the degree to which drug \ninvolvement and alcohol contributed to noted incidents. \nBased on the totality of the SOR allegations, inconsistent testimony, and \nrecurring inappropriate or illegal conduct, Applicant\u2019s judgment continues to be \nquestionable. . . . The allegations are not minor, nor did they occur in unique \ncircumstances where they are not likely to recur. He has not accepted full \nresponsibility for his conduct, and appears to downplay the gravity of his conduct \nor the extent of his involvement. . . . I continue to question his past judgment and \nI am not convinced it is appropriate at this time to mitigate his history of poor \ndecision making and misconduct.

Although Applicant does not cite to any \nspecific matters, the Judge explicitly stated that he was considering certain matters for a limited \npurpose: Applicant\u2019s false statement to the government investigator regarding purchasing \nmarijuana; Applicant\u2019s adoption of the PSI as accurate; and the fact that certain events alleged \nunder Guideline J were also alcohol-related. A Judge is precluded from raising security concerns \noutside the scope of the SOR without amending the SOR and giving the parties a reasonable time \nin which to prepare to address the amendment. However, it is well established that a Judge may \nconsider unfavorable non-alleged matters for those limited purposes to which the Judge cites in \nhis decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). \nOur review \nof the decision reveals that the Judge only considered the non-alleged issues for authorized \npurposes. We find no basis for concluding that the Judge considered matters not alleged in the \nSOR in an inappropriate manner. \nApplicant alleges that the Judge misconstrued his testimony or took evidence out of context \nto \u201cpaint a more negative picture of events.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. For example, Applicant points \nout the Judge failed to note that his comment in the PSI about use of cocaine weekly or quarterly \nwith his former spouse was qualified by the word \u201csporadically.\u201d Id. at 1, citing Government \nExhibit 2 (PSI at 4). None of his arguments, however, establish that the Judge committed any \nharmful error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020), noting an error is \nharmless if it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. To the extent that Applicant is alleging \nbias, we are not persuaded. Bias involves partiality for or against a party, predisposition to decide \na case or issue without regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack of impartiality. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 16-03451 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017).  There is a rebuttable presumption that a \nJudge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy \nburden of persuasion. Id. The standard is not whether a party personally believes a Judge was \nbiased or prejudiced against that party, but rather whether the record of the proceedings below \ncontains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested \nperson to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 \nat 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006). We have examined the entire record and decision. We find nothing \ntherein to suggest that the Judge lacked impartiality or that he entered the hearing with an inflexible \npredisposition against Applicant. The findings of fact are grounded in evidence of record. The \ntranscript does not support any claim of bias. Applicant has directed our attention to nothing that \nwould likely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite impartiality. \nFinally, Applicant contends that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the mitigating \nevidence.  None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption that the \nJudge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in \na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with \nthe requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of \nrecord in reaching his decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.

Applicant requested a hearing. On \nMarch 16, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

The \nJudge found against him on 11 of those debts totaling about $145,000. Applicant, who is in his \nsixties, and his spouse operated a limited liability corporation (LLC) as partners for about 16 years. \nThey used multiple credit cards to fund business operations. The business began experiencing \nfinancial problems in about 2012 and closed in 2018. \u201cApplicant contended the debts were the \nresponsibility of the LLC and not his personal responsibility. (Tr. 56) He did not provide the \ncontracts used to obtain the credit or other documentation showing the LLC was responsible for \nthe debts, or that he was not responsible for the debts.  (Tr. 58-59).\u201d Decision at 2.  \nApplicant took steps to resolve some LLC debts, others fell off his credit report due to the \npassage of time, and others remain in a charge-off status. At least one creditor sued the LLC, and \nApplicant settled and paid the debt without litigating the merits of his liability. A court document \nlisted \u201c[Applicant by name], et. al.,\u201d as defendants. Decision at 3. \nAfter a credit counseling \nservice informed Applicant of state\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, he waited until the statute \nof limitations ran to improve his negotiating position with creditors, but they were not interested \nin settlements. Even though the 11 debts in question may be beyond the statute of limitations, they \nremain relevant for evaluating security clearance eligibility.  \nApplicant is current on his other financial obligations. Over the past five years, he had \nadequate financial resources to resolve the 11 debts. His net worth is about $2.5 million, and he \nestimated his 2021 income after taxes to be about $250,000. There is no evidence the 11 debts are \nbeing resolved.  He presented insufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged security concerns.  \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant again argues that he is not personally responsible for the 11 \ndebts at issue, contending they are the responsibility of the LLC. He asserts that there is no \nevidence that he personally guaranteed these debts, that \u201c[a] credit report is not substantial \nevidence that [Applicant] is personally liable for a debt[,]\u201d and that the Government has not met \nits burden of proving that Applicant was personally responsible for these debts. Appeal Brief at \n18. \nHe also contends the Judge based his decision on Appeal Board precedent that is \ndistinguishable from his case because those cases dealt with applicants who were personally \nresponsible for alleged debts.  These arguments are not persuasive. \nIn the decision, the Judge correctly cited ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010) for the proposition: \nIt is well settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet \nthe substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under \n[Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to \napplicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that \nmatters in mitigation apply.

Some of those debts are listed in later credit reports in the record. \nThe credit reports in the record are sufficient to establish by substantial evidence that Applicant \nwas personally responsible for these debts. Once the debts were proven, Applicant had the burden \nof presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns arising from \nthose debts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Put differently, Applicant had the burden of establishing that he \nhad no personal responsibility for the debts. It also merits noting that the Board has previously \nstated that business-related debts can have a bearing upon the judgement and reliability of \ncompany officials who incurred them. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 93-1096 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n1995), ISCR Case No. 14-01231 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015), and ISCR Case No. ISCR Case \nNo. 12-10335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). From our review of the record, we find no error in \nthe Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant failed to meet his burden of production on this issue. \nApplicant notes the Judge concluded Disqualifying Conditions 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligation;\u201d applied in this case. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c). Applicant \npoints out the Judge later noted in the decision that Disqualifying Conditions \u201c19(a) and 19(c)\u201d \nwere established without explaining why the former disqualifying condition applied.1 Decision at \n6. The Judge\u2019s reference to Disqualifying Condition 19(a) appears to have been a harmless \ntypographical error that had no bearing on the outcome of the case.  \nApplicant further argues the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed the \nevidence, and erred in his analysis of the mitigating conditions and whole-person factors. He \ncontends, for example, that the debts at issue occurred due to circumstances beyond his control \nand that he acted reasonably under the circumstances, e.g., following the advice of the credit \ncounseling service on how to handle the debts; that he adequately disputed the debts by providing \nevidence to substantiate he took action to resolve the debts; and that he is financially stable and \nnot a security risk. None of his arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. \nBd. May 13, 2022). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.

Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2006; failed \nto file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2017 in a timely manner; owed \nover $34,000 in delinquent Federal taxes for 2014, 2015, and 2017-2019; owed about $2,000 in \ndelinquent state taxes for 2015; and had seven other delinquent debts totaling about $6,300. In \nresponding to the SOR, he admitted each of the allegations with explanations. The Judge found \nin favor of Applicant on his 2017 Federal tax indebtedness because he was entitled to a foreign \nexemption for that year and found against him on the remaining allegations.

His financial \nirresponsibility was ongoing, frequent, and casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to a period of unemployment in \n2014 and his belief he was to receive a foreign exemption for certain tax years. His \nunemployment was beyond his control. I also find that his confusion over his \nforeign exemption status was complicated, and he had difficulty understanding its \napplicability. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He did not. He failed to pay any of his debts \nthat became delinquent in 2014 and 2015 until 2021. He also continued to ignore \nhis responsibility to timely file his tax returns and, if he was unable to pay, to \ncontact the IRS to participate in a repayment plan. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. \nApplicant sought the assistance of [tax relief service] to help him resolve his \ntax issues. In 2021, he participated in a repayment plan with the IRS.

Applicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debts \nfor years and then finally paying them does not constitute a good-faith effort to \nrepay his overdue creditors, but rather reflects a last ditch effort to resolve them after \nreceiving the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. [Decision at 9-10.] \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems beginning when he filed \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and had his debts discharged in 2006. It is noted that his \nbankruptcy documents reflected a tax liability of more than $15,000 at the time. \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 unemployment impacted his finances, but his repeated failure to \ntimely file and address his tax debts continued beyond that period. After completing \nhis [security clearance application] in April 2019, he began to address them. \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation \nto timely file and pay his federal income taxes raises serious concerns. The evidence \nshows that Applicant has likely paid all or most of his tax debts and his delinquent \ndebts. However, he also has an unreliable financial track record. His failure to \naddress his delinquent debts for years and failure to comply with timely filing and \npaying his income taxes is a serious concern. Although it appears his delinquent \ndebts and federal and state taxes are now paid, it does not negate his past \nirresponsible conduct and noncompliance with his legal obligations. These facts \ncannot be ignored. Therefore, considering all of the evidence, and despite some \nmitigation, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns.

Rather, he \ncontends the Judge erred by not considering all of the circumstances he confronted and by failing \nto apply the whole-person concept properly. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge failed \nto properly weigh his periods of unemployment, his attempts to mitigate the situation by returning \nto overseas employment, and his unexpected loss of the foreign earned income exclusion for tax \nyears 2016 and 2018.  \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, our review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision \nconfirms that the Judge considered all the evidence presented, including those circumstances cited \nby Applicant in his appeal. In her decision, the Judge thoroughly explored all mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F before concluding that, although AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) apply, Applicant failed \nto fully mitigate the security concerns raised. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is well \ngrounded in the appeal board precedent to which she cites.  \nAs the Judge noted in her decision, failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules, raising questions as \nto whether he will comply with the rules for protecting classified information. Decision at 11, \nciting ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). The fact that Applicant has recently \ncorrected his Federal and state tax problems does not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s \nlongstanding prior behavior and how it reflects on his security worthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 12-05053 at 4\u20135 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Moreover, as the Judge noted, the timing of \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts is relevant, as an applicant who begins to resolve financial \nconcerns only after his clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment to follow rules and \nregulations when his personal interests are not threatened. Decision at 11, citing ISCR Case No. \n17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant requests that the case be remanded to the Judge for reconsideration. The Appeal \nBoard has no authority to remand a case for further proceedings unless it identifies an error below \nthat needs correcting. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.33.2. We have not identified any such error. Applicant \nalso presents additional IRS documents, but the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new \nevidence on appeal.  Directive E3.1.29. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

In examining alleged financial delinquencies, a Judge may consider an applicant\u2019s \nfinancial history. See, e.g., Directive, Encl. 2, App. \u00b6 19(c). Applicant further asserts that his most \nrecent credit report does not reflect any delinquent debts. This assertion is not persuasive.  As the \nBoard previously noted, there is more than one plausible explanation for the absence of debts from \na credit report, such as their removal due to the passage of time, and the absence of unresolved \ndebts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not establish meaningful evidence as to the disposition \nof those debts or constitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation.

In this regard, he claims he did not submit \nevidence regarding the first payment on that plan because it did not appear on his bank statement \nuntil after the hearing closed. This claim, however, constitutes new evidence that the Appeal \nBoard is prohibited from considering.

Of note, the SOR alleged ten delinquent debts \nthat Applicant amassed following the Chapter 7 discharge in 2014. In the record before the Judge, \nthose debts remained in arrears, with \u201cno evidence that Applicant made any payments, established \nany payment plans, or contacted his creditors.\u201d Decision at 2. Applicant made only a simple \nrepresentation that he had filed another Chapter 7 bankruptcy following issuance of the SOR. In \nlight of that record evidence, it was not unreasonable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had \nfailed to demonstrate financial reform and rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-21045 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2004). Moreover, it is well established that, even if debts are ultimately \nresolved through bankruptcy or by other means, a Judge may still consider the circumstances \nunderlying the debts for what they may reveal about an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility. See, \ne.g., ADP Case No. 17-00684 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). \nApplicant\u2019s brief also contains financial details and assertions that were not previously \npresented to the Judge for consideration. The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new \nevidence on appeal.  Directive E3.1.29. \nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. The standard applicable to trustworthiness \ncases is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), regarding \nsecurity clearances:  such a determination \u201cmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-01882 at 2 (App. Bd.

He and his wife incurred significant \ndebt by borrowing money and using credit cards. Their financial obligations also increased when \ntheir oldest son and his family moved back into their home. In May 2018, Applicant and his wife \nhired a credit-counseling company to assist them with their debt. The company advised him to \nstop paying on the accounts so settlements could be negotiated. When only one debt was resolved \nin a six-month period, Applicant stopped working with that company and began working with a \nlaw firm to help resolve the debts.  He also sold non-essential assets to reduce the debt. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven charged-off debts totaling about $94,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, he admitted each allegation. Applicant has assets to pay the alleged debts, \nincluding over $500,000 in a retirement account, about $500,000 in home equity, and about $1,500 \nas a net monthly income remainder. He also \u201chas an \u2018unvested\u2019 interest in his employer\u2019s public \nstock with a value of over $345,000 and vested shares worth about $28,000.\u201d  Decision at 5. The \nJudge found for Applicant on the three debts he resolved and against him on the four remaining \nunresolved debts. Three of the unresolved debts are no longer collectible due to the expiration of \nthe statute of limitations, while the fourth is being disputed \u201cunder an unspecified legal theory.\u201d \nDecision at 4.   Applicant has resolved other delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR. \n[Applicant] exercised poor judgment through excessive spending using multiple \ncredit cards. His poor judgment continued by his reliance on his counselor\u2019s advice \nto stop paying his credit cards when he could have continued to pay them and seek \nto negotiate settlements of all of his debts over time.  Instead, he waited for time to \nelapse and render some of his debts unenforceable under applicable state statute of \nlimitations.  [Decision at 9.] \nDiscussion \nDue Process Issues \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises various due process issues. First, he contends that he \nemailed evidentiary exhibits to DOHA that were not presented to the Judge prior to the hearing.  \nTo the extent he is contending this was a procedural error that prejudiced him, we conclude no \nrelief on appeal is warranted.  About eight days before the hearing, Applicant emailed 14 exhibits \nto DOHA. The email and exhibits are included in the record. Correspondence File. At the hearing, \nthe Judge noted he was presented with 17 exhibits prior to going on the record (Tr. at 26), which \nincluded the 14 exhibits provided in the email. The 17 exhibits were admitted into evidence as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits G-W.1 Since the Judge had the exhibits in question prior to rendering his \ndecision, Applicant has failed to show how he was prejudiced by the delay in presenting them to \nthe Judge.  \n1 One page of the 14 exhibits is not included in the admitted exhibits. The missing page is a summary of a bank \nstatement (Exhibit 13, page 1). The admitted pages of that exhibit (Exhibit 13, pages 2 and 3) contain the information \nthat is in the missing page. The omission of the summary page from the admitted exhibit did not result in harmful \nerror. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nSecond, Applicant claims Department Counsel made statements to him that \u201ccreated an \nunfair hearing process.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Coming from outside the record, these claims \nconstitute new evidence, which we are generally prohibited from considering. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nWe will, however, consider them because they raise due process claims. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). \nApplicant claims Department Counsel \u201cprovided recommendations to [him] on how to \npresent evidence prior to hearing start which created an unfair hearing process and confusion for \n[him.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. In making this generalized claim, Applicant provides no specific \nexplanation as to how he may have been confused or prejudiced by Department Counsel\u2019s \npurported statements. Prior to the hearing, Applicant was provided the Chief Administrative \nJudge\u2019s Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and \nTrustworthiness (ADP) Hearings, dated January 15, 2019.2 This guidance advised Applicant that \nhe had a right to present evidence and witnesses; that he had a right to cross-examine witnesses \nagainst him, and that he had the right to object to evidence. Applicant has not claimed or shown \nthat Department Counsel\u2019s purported statements contradicted the Chief Judge\u2019s guidance.  \nRegarding this claim, it also merits noting there is a rebuttable presumption that Federal officials \nand employees carry out their duties in good faith, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption \nhas a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. \n20, 2001). Applicant has not met that heavy burden in that he fails to identify anything in the \nrecord below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department \nCounsel misled him or otherwise acted improperly, unfairly, or unprofessionally.  \nApplicant also claims Department Counsel \u201cstated most people represent themselves and \nto just tell your story[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. To the extent Applicant is claiming Department \nCounsel somehow misled him by that statement and thereby caused him not to hire counsel or \nobtain personal representation, we do not find that argument persuasive. The record contains a \nletter that Department Counsel sent to Applicant more than a month before the hearing. It advised \nhim that \u201c[y]ou may represent yourself, retain an attorney, or obtain the help of a personal \nrepresentative who could be a union representative, family adviser, knowledgeable friend, or \nanyone else. In making this decision, you should consider the Government is represented by an \nattorney and that any adverse determination could negatively affect your current job and your \nfuture employability.\u201d Correspondence File, Department Counsel\u2019s letter of July 1, 2021. The \nChief Judge\u2019s guidance also advised Applicant of his right to employ counsel, or to have some \nother person represent him during the proceeding. At the beginning of the hearing, Judge also \nasked Applicant if he understood that he had a right to have a lawyer. Applicant responded that \nhe understood this right and indicated that he decided to represent himself.  Tr. at 8-9.  During the \nhearing, Applicant presented documentary evidence and testified on his own behalf. Applicant \npoints to nothing in the record which he likely would have done differently had he been represented \nby counsel, or anything likely to have produced a different result. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08\u00ad\n07352 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2009). Applicant has failed to show his right to counsel or a personal \nrepresentation was impeded or infringed.  \n2 A DOHA email of July 19, 2021 provided Applicant the prehearing guidance.

The Chief Judge\u2019s prehearing guidance advised \nApplicant that the hearing was an adversarial proceeding.  See also ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 9 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005). Department Counsel was responsible for representing the Government\u2019s \ninterests\u2015not Applicant\u2019s\u2015in the proceeding. \nFinally, Applicant contends that the Judge offered him only a short period of time to \naddress the debts and notes that financial problems can take up to seven years to resolve. As the \nJudge indicated in his decision, a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Instead, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. \n22, 2008). An applicant is not entitled to delay or defer adjudication of security eligibility to \nresolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-22044 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2008). In this case, the \nJudge decided to keep the record open for about a month after the hearing to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to present additional evidence. When the Judge informed him of that decision, \nApplicant responded, \u201cThat would be fine.\u201d Tr. at 93-94. The record does not reflect that \nApplicant submitted any request to extend the period for post-hearing submissions. Applicant has \nnot shown the Judge\u2019s decision regarding this issue was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nIn summary, under the facts of this case, there is no basis to conclude that Applicant was \ndenied the due process afforded by the Directive.  \nAnalytical Issues \nFor three of the unresolved debts, Applicant argues that he exercised his consumer rights \nregarding them. He contends no further action need be taken regarding them, noting they have \nbeen charged off and the creditors have not requested further action from him. However, even if \ndelinquent debts are legally unenforceable because the state statute of limitations has expired, a \nJudge may still consider the circumstances surrounding the debts, including any irresponsible \nactions in incurring or handling them, for what they reveal about an applicant\u2019s worthiness for a \nclearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-26018 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2005). For the fourth \nunresolved debt, Applicant makes assertions from outside the record, which we cannot consider.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29 (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments are, in effect, a challenge to the way in which the Judge \nweighed the evidence. None of his arguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02592 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). Applicant also notes the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision will \nhave a negative impact on him. The Directive, however, does not permit us to consider such \nconsequences.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02020 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2020). \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 22, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On July 26, \n2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged ten financial concerns\u2014Chapter 7 bankruptcies in 1998 and 2010 and \neight delinquent debts. The Judge found for Applicant on the two bankruptcies and against \nApplicant on the eight delinquent debts. The favorable findings are not in issue. Applicant raises \nthe following issue on appeal\u2014whether the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Two are student loans that \ntotal about $90,000, and the other six are delinquent medical debts. The student loans first became \ndue sometime in 2010, but Applicant applied for forbearance or deferrals for several years. At \nmost, Applicant made one or two payments on the loans. In December 2021, he entered into a \nstudent loan rehabilitation agreement, prompted\u2014he admitted\u2014by receipt of the SOR.  As of the \nhearing, Applicant had not yet started payments under his rehabilitation agreement. The Judge \ntook administrative notice that all federal student loans were deferred as of late March 2020, but \nalso noted that Applicant was delinquent on the debts prior to their placement in a deferment status.    \nIn April 2021, Applicant borrowed money from a family member and settled the six \ndelinquent medical debts. He then borrowed money from his retirement savings to pay back his \nfamily member. Applicant admitted that receipt of the SOR motivated him to settle and pay the \nmedical debts, which arose in 2018. \nApplicant has \u201ctwice afforded himself fresh starts through Chapter 7 bankruptcies, thereby \ndischarging hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt,\u201d but once again has financial problems.  \nDecision at 6. His student loan debt has been due for over a decade and has been in collection for \nseveral years.  Additionally, he had delinquent medical debt that went unresolved for many years. \nHe has now resolved his medical debts and entered into a rehabilitation plan for his student loans. \nHowever, the timing of his efforts\u2014only after he received notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \n\u2014 reduces their value in mitigation. \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances \nor that he made a good-faith effort to pay his student loans and medical debts. . . . \nHis prolonged history of financial problems with little to no track record of financial \nstability fails to show that his financial issues are unlikely to recur.  [Id. at 7.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by mis-weighing the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. For example, Applicant \nargues that the Judge \u201crefused to find in favor of Applicant regarding [the medical debts] solely \ndue to the timing of Appellant\u2019s efforts to rectify these debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. However, the \nJudge\u2019s determination that Applicant\u2019s post-SOR efforts were of \u201clittle mitigative value\u201d is well-\nrooted in the Appeal Board precedent to which he cites. Decision at 7. None of Applicant\u2019s \narguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence \nor to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-30s and has received two college degrees.

In \n2014, an employer reprimanded him for showing up at work hungover and smelling of alcohol. A \nyear later, the employer again reprimanded Applicant for excessive tardiness due to alcohol \nconsumption.  \nIn late 2016, Applicant was on a temporary duty assignment overseas. While there, he \nwould consume alcohol with fellow employees and on the date in question met a foreign woman \nat a bar. Applicant and the woman consumed alcohol together and later that night engaged in \nsexual relations. The next day, Applicant reported late to work and smelled of alcohol. Applicant \ndid not report this foreign contact to his employer. Upon discovery of Applicant\u2019s conduct, his \nemployer gave him one more chance to modify his behavior. \nIn mid-2017, Applicant went to a bar in the U.S., where he consumed between 8 to 10 \ndrinks, including beer, mixed drinks, and shots.  Later, while driving himself and his companions \nhome, Applicant was in a traffic accident in which he struck a car from behind while he was \ntravelling about 45 mph. Subsequent breathalyzer testing yielded a result of .195%. Pleading no \ncontest, Applicant was convicted of DUI with property damage and sentenced to 12 months \nsupervised probation, fined, and assessed court costs. He was also required to undergo alcohol \ntreatment and complete 50 hours of community service. \nApplicant was terminated from \nemployment due to his issues with alcohol. \nApplicant completed his court-ordered alcohol treatment, his counselor diagnosing him \nwith Alcohol Dependency, sustained remission. The counselor stated that Applicant\u2019s prognosis \nwas good if he was involved in a support system such as Alcoholics Anonymous but fair if he was \nnot involved in a support system. The counselor told Applicant that if he wished to follow up with \ngroup treatment he could do so at no charge. Applicant testified that he modified his drinking \nhabits by not consuming alcohol every day, \u201cbut he drinks a couple of times a week and has \nbetween 8 and 12 beers at a time.\u201d Decision at 4. Applicant stated that he does not drink to \nintoxication while having custody of his minor child. Applicant has close family relations who \nare or were alcoholic, and he has lost a friendship due to his continued drinking. He has not \nparticipated in alcohol counseling since completing his court-ordered treatment. He testified at \nthe hearing that he now intends to abstain from drinking and to attend counseling.  \nThe Judge noted the extent of Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems and his failure to have attended \ncounseling beyond his court-ordered sessions. She stated that Applicant continues to abuse alcohol \ndespite its negative impact upon him and his various relationships. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse to include his multiple \nincidents at work; incidents away from work; habitual drinking; diagnosis of \nAlcohol Dependent, in remission; court-ordered treatment; opportunity to attend \ncounseling free of charge; multiple declarations that he modified his drinking habits \nafter each incident; multiple declarations that he was seeking counseling; and his \nmost recent declaration that he would abstain from drinking. Although not alleged, \nI have also considered the risks he willingly takes when consuming alcohol such as \ndriving, caring for his young child, and having intimate contact with a foreign \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational when he was intoxicated holding a security clearance1 . . . He has not taken \nthe necessary steps to address his problem with alcohol, despite repeatedly \npromising to do so. I cannot find that there are changed circumstances or that he \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation. I have considered that he has not had \nan alcohol-related incident since his DUI arrest and that is some mitigation, but it \nis insufficient to conclude that his behavior was infrequent, happened under unusual \ncircumstances and is unlikely to recur. [Decision at 9-10.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider, or that she mis-weighed, significant \nrecord evidence, including the absence of alcohol incidents since 2017, his completion of court-\nordered alcohol counseling, and his evidence of modified consumption. He argues that continued \ncounseling beyond that ordered by the court was not formally recommended and that the Judge \nextended too much weight to his having failed to take advantage of that opportunity. He also \nargues that the Judge erred in concluding that he had not demonstrated changed circumstances \ndespite the evidence cited above. We have considered Applicant\u2019s appeal arguments in light of \nthe record evidence. The Judge made findings about the issues Applicant has raised and she \ndiscussed them in her analysis. We interpret the Judge\u2019s challenged comment to mean that \nApplicant has not shown changes in circumstances sufficient to demonstrate rehabilitation, not \nthat there have been no changes at all in his conduct. For example, his evidence that he now drinks \nsubstantial amounts of alcohol fewer times a week describes a change that a reasonable person \ncould find far short of that necessary to mitigate SOR concerns rooted in alcohol dependency. \nApplicant has advanced an alternative interpretation of the record, which is not enough to show \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nMoreover, Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence \nin the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01236 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2022). We have given \ndue consideration to the cases that Applicant has cited, both from the Hearing Office and from the \nAppeal Board.  However, each case must be decided upon its own merits.  The cited cases are not \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions. Id. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nFebruary 5, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On \nSeptember 19, 2022, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had five delinquent debts totaling over $47,000. These \nincluded a charged-off credit union loan for about $43,860 and four medical debts in collection. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations pertaining to the \ncredit union loan and one of the medical debts. She denied the other three medical debts. The \nJudge found against Applicant on credit union debt and in favor of her on the medical debts. \nRegarding the credit union debt, the Judge concluded that Applicant did not make a good-faith \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \neffort to resolve it; that she did not act responsibly under the circumstances; that the debt was \nrecent, ongoing, and continued to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; \nand that none of the mitigating conditions applied to that allegation. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased and whether \nhis decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm \nthe Judge\u2019s decision. \nBias \nApplicant\u2019s brief states: \n[T]he Judge admitted on record to being a member of the . . . Credit Union and \nhaving financial ties with the institution. He stated, he was disappointed that the \nCredit Union did not receive payment for the debt. The Judge even states in his \nruling, that the \u201capplicant\u2019s financial stability came at the expense of the credit \nunion.\u201d These ties and the above contradictions show the Judge was unable to \nseparate his personal attachments to the Credit Union from this case. I believe he \nruled against me keeping my security clearance based on his bias and not on a fair \nassessment of a potential risk to national security.  [Appeal Brief at 2.] \nDuring the hearing, the Judge noted he was a member of that credit union. Tr. at 27. However, \nwe find nothing in the Judge\u2019s decision or in the record to support Applicant\u2019s assertion that the \nJudge expressed his disappointment that the credit union debt was not paid. \nTo address Applicant\u2019s bias claim, it is helpful to examine 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, which sets \nforth the disqualification requirements for Federal judges. Under \u00a7 455(b)(4), a Federal judge \nshall disqualify himself when he \u201chas a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy, or \nin a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the \noutcome of the proceeding[.]\u201d The term \u201cfinancial interest\u201d is defined in the statute. That \ndefinition provides, \u201cThe proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual insurance company, of \na depositor in a mutual saving association, or a similar proprietary interest, is a \u2018financial interest\u2019 \nin the organization only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of \nthe interest.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 455(d)(4)(iii). Mere membership in a credit union is similar to the proprietary \ninterest of being a depositor in a mutual saving association and is disqualifying only if the outcome \nof the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the Judge\u2019s financial interest in that \ninstitution. \nIt should go without saying that the credit union identified in the SOR allegation is not a \nparty to Applicant\u2019s security clearance proceeding. In this proceeding, moreover, the \u201csubject \nmatter in controversy\u201d is Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. As the Appeal Board has \nrepeatedly stated in the past, a security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection proceeding, \nbut rather is aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.1 See, \nFor debts involving financial institutions (banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage lenders, \netc.) or commercial entities (consumer debts), alleging the identity of the creditor in an SOR allegation is helpful to \nplace the applicant on notice of the specific debt at issue. However, the identity of the creditor for those types of debts \n1 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The outcome of the Judge\u2019s security \nclearance determination is likely to have no effect on the value of his financial interest in the credit \nunion. Given these circumstances, a reasonable, well-informed observer with access to all the \nfacts is unlikely to question the Judge\u2019s impartiality in this case.  See, e.g., United States v. Stone, \n866, F.3d 219, 229-31 (4th Cir. 2017). We conclude that Applicant failed to meet her heavy burden \non her to rebut the presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). \nWeighing Evidence \nApplicant argues the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis and whole-person assessment are \ndefective. For example, she points to the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions that were favorable to \nher and argues they establish her security clearance worthiness. However, the presence of some \nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance \ndecision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of \nthe evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). See also, Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nis generally of no significance in the Judge\u2019s analysis in determining whether the applicant acted responsibly in \nacquiring, handling, or resolving such debts. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Additionally, the \nJudge found that Applicant made a $1,000 payment to the IRS after the hearing. In his analysis, \nthe Judge concluded: \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, she has failed for the most part to take any documented \nvoluntary steps to address her accumulated delinquent federal and state tax . . . and \nprovide persuasive proof of her voluntary resolving these debts.  \n1 In her SOR Response, Applicant made a similar argument. In the decision, the Judge noted, \u201c[Applicant] claimed \ngenerally that she did not have any of the underlying conditions characterized as potential problems under the financial \nconsiderations guideline.\u201d Decision at 2. \n2 In her appeal brief, Applicant acknowledges the decision to rely on tax refund withholdings to resolve this \nindebtedness was a mistake. She states, \u201cI explained I had tried to reinstate a payment plan with the IRS on a few \noccasions but after being on hold on the telephone for hours each time and not being able to start a payment plan, I \nsettled on the use of tax refunds to settle the debt as a strategy. It was brought to my attention this was a fool hardy \nway to settle the matter and I agree.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant is credited with making some voluntary payments on her \n2013-2015 federal tax and 2015 state tax payment obligations, most of the tax and \nother payments were credited through involuntary levies on her scheduled tax \nrefunds for other years. Debts reduced through involuntary initiatives, such as \ncreditor levies, attachments . . . , generally do not meet the mitigation requirements \nof MC [Mitigating Condition] \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith [effort] to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Absent \nmore evidence of voluntary payment initiatives on Applicant\u2019s part to discharge her \ndocumented delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2013-2015, state taxes for tax year \n2015 . . . , MC \u00b6 20(d) is not available to Applicant.  [Decision at 11-12.] \nWe find no error in this analysis. The satisfaction of a debt through involuntary payments\u2015such \nas a tax levy or the withholding of tax refunds\u2015is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith \ninitiation of repayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, \n2018). Moreover, although Applicant\u2019s Federal tax debts for 2013 and 2014 are resolved, the \nJudge was not precluded from finding against her on those debts. As we have previously stated, \neven if an applicant paid a debt or is making payments on a debt, a Judge may still consider the \ncircumstances underlying the debt as well as any previous actions or lapses to resolve the debt for \nwhat they reveal about the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). The Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings regarding the SOR tax \nallegations are sustainable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant was delinquent on a credit card debt in the approximate \namount of $214,175. Applicant disputes this debt, which relates to a private business she operated \nfrom 2004 to 2015. This dispute involves the billing model that an internet search-engine company \nuses for charging advertisers on its platform. More specifically, the dispute centers on Applicant\u2019s \nclaim that she should be billed for \u201cvisits\u201d to rather than \u201cclicks\u201d on her website. Applicant \ncontends there were only 839 visits to her website and disputes being charged for 71,000 clicks. \nIn this regard, the Judge found: \nEnsuing investigations by both the credit card issuer and the charging \ninternet merchant with Applicant-supplied data produced favorable results for the \nfinancing credit card firm who confirmed that validity of the billings. (AEs F and \nH; Tr. 90-91) Communications between Applicant and the internet merchant \nwhose services she used for her business advertising never facilitated any kind of \nresolution of the charges billed to SOR creditor 1.g. Unable to convince her \ncreditors of the validity of her claims, Applicant ceased all communications with \nboth the creditor and internet merchant after June 2014. (GEs 2-4 and AEs F and \nH; Tr. 38-46) Applicant\u2019s dispute with SOR creditor 1.g has never been resolved.  \n(Tr. 92) Credit reports confirm that in 2016 the debt was charged off to profit and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloss.

[Decision at 6.] \nIn his analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant provided insufficient evidence to support the \napplication of Mitigating Condition 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis for the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue[.]\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(e). Based on our review of the record, we find no error in the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not meet her burden under this mitigating condition to \nproduce sufficient documentation to show she had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthis debt.3 Furthermore, the fact that a debt is no longer reported on her recent credit report is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, \n2016). \nApplicant\u2019s brief also highlights her efforts to resolve her financial problems. None of her \narguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge reached conclusions that were arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. Additionally, Applicant contends the \nrevocation of her security clearance will have a negative impact on her. The Directive, however, \ndoes not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01206 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT  \nRyan C. Nerney, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 7, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On January 20, 2022, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used both marijuana and cocaine \nbetween 2007 and 2009 while holding a security clearance. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant falsified his security clearance applications in 2011 and 2020 regarding his drug \nuse. Applicant admitted all allegations. The Judge found that the Guideline H concerns were \nmitigated due to the passage of time; those favorable findings are not in issue on appeal. The \nJudge found adversely on the Guideline E allegations. The Applicant raised the following issues \non appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, whether he failed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto apply the mitigating conditions, and whether his adverse decision is consequently arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 62 years old and married. He has held a security clearance since 1985 and has \nbeen employed by the same defense contractor since 1989. Between January 2007 and December \n2009, while granted access to classified information, Applicant used marijuana about once or twice \na month and used cocaine twice.  \nIn November 2011, Applicant falsified his SCA by failing to disclose his marijuana and \ncocaine use. In May 2020, Applicant falsified his SCA by failing to disclose his cocaine use. The \nJudge found both falsifications to be willful. Decision at 2. \u201cApplicant\u2019s willful falsifications \ncover a decade. He made no prompt, good-faith effort to correct this personal misconduct on either \noccasion.\u201d  Decision at 6. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in two regards: first, he failed to consider all the mitigation evidence \nsubmitted; and, second, he failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions. Consequently, \nApplicant argues, the Judge rendered a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nIn particular, Applicant argues that the Judge failed in his application of Adjudicative \nGuideline (AG) \u00b6 17(a)\u2014the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. Directive, Encl. 2., App. A. \nApplicant contends that, although he failed to disclose his drug use on his 2011 SCA, he reported \nthe marijuana use on his 2020 SCA and volunteered the cocaine use during his subsequent \nclearance interview, placing him solidly within AG \u00b6 17(a). The Board is not persuaded by this \nargument. \nWe turn first to the falsification of his SCA in November 2011. The word \"prompt\" is not \ndefined in the Adjudicative Guidelines or in Appeal Board precedent. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n98-0809 at 5 (App. Bd. August 19, 1999).  Resolution of this appeal does not require the Board to \nprovide a \"bright line\" definition of the word \"prompt,\" as nine years is inarguably outside the \nmeaning of the word. The Judge properly determined that Applicant\u2019s partial correction in 2020\u2014 \nnine years later\u2014failed to mitigate the 2011 falsification. \nTurning to the falsification in May 2020, Applicant\u2019s argument is facially more persuasive. \nHe contends that he disclosed his marijuana use on the SCA and then volunteered his cocaine use \nat his clearance interview two months later, in July 2020. However, the security concerns raised \nby an applicant\u2019s falsifications are not necessarily mitigated by the fact that the applicant \nvoluntarily disclosed his falsifications to an investigator upon interview. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004). That is particularly true under the facts of this case.  \nTestimony at hearing established that Applicant failed a polygraph for a new job in 2013. \nAlthough he was never advised of the specific reason that he failed the polygraph, Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuspected that it was because he had disclosed his marijuana use, but failed to disclose his cocaine \nuse.

In the wake of that incident, Applicant was \u201cdetermined not to have anything \nin [his] life that [he] couldn\u2019t be straightforward about\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hide things \nanymore because it wasn\u2019t a good feeling.\u201d  Tr. at 19, 22. \nFollowing that 2013 epiphany, however, Applicant did not correct his 2011 falsification.  \nIndeed, when it was time for his periodic clearance renewal in 2020, Applicant chose again not to \ndisclose his cocaine use. Said differently, Applicant made the same decision he made at the 2013 \npolygraph\u2014to report the marijuana use, but not the cocaine use\u2014despite his resolution \u201cnot to \nhide things anymore.\u201d Tr. at 22. The Judge\u2019s determination that this repeated falsification in 2020 \nwas willful and was not mitigated by the subsequent disclosure is amply supported by the evidence \nof record.    \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 20, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On March 25, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline E allegations and on one Guideline \nF allegation. Those favorable findings were not challenged on appeal. The Judge found against \nApplicant on five delinquent debt allegations. In his findings of fact, the Judge noted two of those \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) involved the same debt. The four debts at issue total about \n$32,000.

He was \nunemployed for about a year between 2009 and 2010 and for about four months between 2016 and \n2017. He has held a security clearance since 2007. He took his children on trips outside the United \nStates in 2011, 2017, and in either 2018 or 2019.  The latter trip cost about $1,500. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. This debt is for a car loan that Applicant opened in 2017. The car was totaled \nin an accident. The loan became delinquent in 2019. Applicant had \u201cGAP\u201d insurance on the car \nand is negotiating with the insurance company on the amount he has to pay under the policy. He \ntestified he entered into a formal payment agreement with the creditor in February 2021. He \nprovided no documentation of that agreement. His intent to repay the debt was thwarted by marital \nplans and other obligations, including the Christmas holidays. In a post-hearing submission, \nApplicant provided a document showing the account was closed in 2019 with a zero balance, but \nit does not show how the account was resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. This account is for a line of credit that was opened in Applicant\u2019s name in 2015 \nand became delinquent in 2016. He claimed this account was the result of identity theft. He \ndisputed the debt with a credit service but testified that he was still making payments towards it.  \nThe debt was closed in 2016 with a zero balance. \u201cThe unanswered question is how did the account \nclose [in] 2016, with a zero balance, but he was still making payments on the account in 2021.\u201d \nDecision at 4. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.  Both of these accounts are for the same auto loan that was opened in \n2016 and became delinquent in 2017. Applicant owes this debt, but he filed a dispute when the \ncreditor refused to fix the car while it was under warranty. He fixed the vehicle with his own \nmoney, and it broke down again.  He asked the creditor to repossess it because it was a lemon. In \nFebruary 2021, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement, but has missed payments. He \ntestified that he refused to make payments because he was treated unfairly. He presented \ndocumentation indicating he disputed the debt because it was opened fraudulently. The creditor\u2019s \ninvestigation verified the debt was accurate.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. This debt was for dental services received in 2015 and became delinquent in \n2020. Applicant recalled this involved services that were not completed because there was a \nproblem with his insurance. Another dentist completed the service. He was informed the statute \nof limitations could apply to this debt. He paid about $600 on this debt in 2021 and agreed to \nmake regular electronic payments to the creditor.  \nBesides the alleged debts, Applicant has incurred no new debt. His financial problems are \nattributable to his unemployment. He has talked to a credit union advisor and financial counselor. \nHe has the reputation of being a diligent and trustworthy employee.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \n\u201cThe delinquencies and Applicant\u2019s confusing and conflicting explanations about their \nstatus continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgement.\u201d  Decision \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nat 8.  Except for a three-month period between 2016 and 2017, he has been continually employed \nduring the past 11 years. Instead of making good-faith efforts to pay the debts, he relied on the \nstatute of limitations to resolve four of them. He did not present sufficient evidence to show he \nhad a legitimate basis to dispute any of the debts. His testimony regarding the debts undermines \nhis credibility. Overall, Applicant presented no meaningful evidence that most of his financial \nproblems are being resolved or are under control. \nDiscussion \nIn his brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred in concluding there was no indication \nApplicant participated in a premarital counseling session given by a minister that addressed \nfinancial counseling. The minister\u2019s letter, however, states, \u201c[Applicant] was receptive to the \ninformation. He was advised to monitor his spending over time to see what was being spent and \nwhere (ex. cash flow and misc. spending), what was owed and needed to be paid off . . . .\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit K. Applicant also testified that he participated in marriage counseling that \nincluded financial counseling. Tr. at 86. Even though the Judge may have erred in reaching that \nconclusion, it was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See \ne.g., ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 18-02239 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020). \nIn his Guideline F analysis, the Judge concluded that Disqualifying Conditions 19(a), \ninability to satisfy debt, and 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations, applied in this \ncase. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). On appeal, Applicant argues he \u201cnever had \nan inability to satisfy any debt.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. Interestingly, he also asserts on the same \npage of his brief that his debts \u201cresulted from peculiar circumstances following a period of \nunderemployment and unemployment.\u201d Id. In testifying about his periods of unemployment in \n2009 and 2016, Applicant stated: \nWhen you stop working you have to literally rely off of your unemployment.  So I \nwas only making enough to pay some of my current bills. I was also getting help \nfrom my mother on paying some of my bills. But some of them fell to the wayside \nand it was actually on one of my credit report (sic) during those times.  [Tr. 27] \nThe Judge committed no error in concluding Disqualifying Condition 19(a) applied. Substantial \nevidence in the record supports that conclusion. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. He argues, for example, the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, misapplied \nthe mitigating conditions, misweighed the evidence, and erred in his whole-person assessment. \nNone of his arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00290 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2022). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.

Those matters constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is \nprohibited from considering. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all the evidence. He also argues that he \nencountered conditions beyond his control contributing to his financial problems, that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, and that he is financially stable. None of his arguments, \nhowever, are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the \nrecord or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

In April 2001, Applicant and her husband filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and eligible debts were discharged in October 2001.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT  \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 7, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On March 29, \n2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Eric H. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two financial concerns\u2014a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 and another in \n2019. At hearing, the Government amended the SOR to allege a federal tax issue. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on the original two allegations and for Applicant on the additional \nallegation. The favorable finding is not in issue. Applicant raises the following issue on appeal \n\u2014whether the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, rendering his adverse \ndecision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Divorced from her first husband, she married her current husband in \n2000. She has two adult children and three adult stepchildren. \nIn April 2001, Applicant and her husband filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and \neligible debts were discharged in October 2001. Applicant testified that about $17,000 in \nunsecured debt from their earlier marriages was discharged. \nApplicant\u2019s husband is in his late sixties. Upon his retirement in 2007, he took a lump-\nsum payout in the amount of about $400,000, which he placed in an investment account. Prior to \nretirement, he also had a part-time realtor practice and planned to transition to a full-time realtor \nin retirement. He used withdrawals from his retirement account to pay initial costs as a full-time \nrealtor and to start a small furniture retail business, which triggered tax liabilities and penalties. \nWith the national financial crisis of 2008, his retirement account was reduced to about $200,000, \nhis real estate business plummeted, and his small retail business quickly closed. From then through \nSeptember 2013, Applicant\u2019s husband took additional withdrawals from his retirement account to \ncover monthly expenses. In 2013, the couple elected to downsize. They sold their larger home \nand used the last $60,000 from his retirement account to purchase a smaller home. \nAfter purchase of their new home, the couple incurred a $237,000 construction loan to \ncomplete renovations. In addition, they charged approximately $11,000 on credit cards for items \nnot covered by the loan. In about 2014, Applicant\u2019s husband began receiving approximately \n$1,900/month in Social Security benefits.  In 2015, he closed his real estate practice. From about \n2016 to 2019, he drove a school bus, with an annual income of about $20,000, to supplement his \nSocial Security income. \nIn January 2019, the couple was only making minimum payments on their credit-card bills. \nAfter consulting the bankruptcy attorney whom they previously used, the couple filed a petition \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The joint unsecured debts included approximately $71,600 in credit \ncards and personal loans; $16,300 for delinquent taxes; and $85,600 in student loans. Their eligible \ndebts were discharged in June 2019. \nApplicant attributed the 2019 bankruptcy to the downturn in the housing market, losses in \nthe husband\u2019s retirement account, and their mistake in taking early withdrawals from that account \nto pay bills. When questioned why she did not elect a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan or a \ndebt-consolidation plan, Applicant testified that she favored a fresh start and was concerned about \ngenerating the income necessary to make payments under either of those options.  \nBeginning in 2008, the couple owed significant federal income taxes due to early \nwithdrawals from Husband\u2019s retirement account. Applicant testified that, for TY2008 through \nTY2012, they owed and paid approximately $42,700, using further withdrawals from her \nhusband\u2019s retirement account to pay those liabilities. Applicant also testified that she took two \n$10,000 loans from her own retirement account to pay for her daughters\u2019 weddings in 2008 and \n2011. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nIn TY2013, the couple owed $19,600 in federal taxes in excess of their withholding, largely \nbecause of withdrawals from her husband\u2019s retirement account. \nIn November 2014, they \nestablished a payment plan with the IRS and made monthly payments from January 2015 until \nfiling for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2019. For TY2014. the couple owed approximately \n$6,950 in excess of withholding. No payments were allocated to the TY2014 delinquency prior to \nthe bankruptcy discharge. Upon the bankruptcy discharge, approximately $7,400 in federal taxes, \npenalties, and interest were written off for TY2013 and 2014. Currently, Applicant and her \nhusband have no delinquent federal taxes. \nAfter the June 2019 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant reduced some of their monthly \nexpenses and increased her retirement withholding. A September 2021 credit report reflects no \nnew delinquent accounts. Applicant testified that they recently refinanced their residence, received \n$16,000 in a cash payout, and have approximately $19,000 in their checking account. In January \n2021, Applicant received a promotion and raise. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe real estate market collapse and the significant loss in her husband\u2019s retirement account \nwere conditions largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nresulted from her husband\u2019s repeated early withdrawals from his retirement account, done with \nher knowledge and approval. Applicant chose to pay approximately $20,000 towards her \ndaughters\u2019 weddings in 2008 and 2011 rather than use the funds to pay her delinquent taxes and \nother debts. Although the couple downsized their residence in 2014, they obtained a large \nconstruction loan and incurred credit-card expenses to complete a significant renovation. \nApplicant testified that they did not implement any cost-cutting measures until after their 2019 \nbankruptcy discharge. They elected to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and there is no \ndocumentary evidence that they initiated any other debt resolution efforts to repay creditors or \nsettle debts.  \nWhile Applicant and [her husband] experienced some circumstances beyond their \ncontrol, they repeatedly acted in a manner that worsened their tax problems and \nfinancial problems, and twice elected a \u201cfresh start\u201d through bankruptcy discharge \ninstead of repaying their creditors. Taken in its entirety \u2013 including the recurring \nand worsening tax problems, the two bankruptcies, the $80,000 in discharged debt \nand taxes, the several years of tax payments, and the current financial situation \u2013 \ndoubts remain about Applicant\u2019s adherence to the fulfilment of her financial \nobligations under contractual terms.  \n. \n. \n. \nAlthough she has not incurred any financial delinquencies since her June \n2019 bankruptcy discharge, it is too soon to conclude that financial problems are \nunlikely to recur given the years of such problems.

Appeal Brief at 11.  Our review of the record confirms that Applicant was asked \nduring the hearing whether she had considered a debt consolidation repayment plan or a Chapter \n13 repayment plan. Although she initially equivocated in her response, she ultimately testified \nthat she had sought advice on both options. The Judge extended an opportunity for Applicant to \nsubmit documentation of any efforts, but she failed to do so. Tr. at 61\u201362, 100, 121\u2013122. In his \nanalysis, the Judge more specifically concludes that \u201c[t]here is no documentary evidence that they \ninitiated any other debt-resolution efforts to repay their creditors or settle their debts.\u201d Decision at \n9 (emphasis added). That conclusion is supported by the record. Any error in the Judge\u2019s finding \nthat there was no evidence of such efforts is harmless, as it did not likely have an impact on the \noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020).  \nSecond, Applicant highlights that bankruptcy is \u201ca legally authorized means for resolving \ndelinquent debt\u201d and that she has now been financially stable for almost three years. Appeal Brief \nat 11\u201312, 14. It is well established that, although an applicant has a legal right to file for \nbankruptcy, the Government may still consider the applicant\u2019s underlying financial circumstances \nfor what they reveal about judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02246 at 2\u20133 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). Additionally, even though bankruptcy is a legal option, the Judge may \nconsider what efforts, if any, Applicant took to resolve the debts short of bankruptcy.  Id. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He came to the U.S. about ten years \nago and was naturalized a U.S. citizen about five years later. In 2018, he was hired by a Defense \ncontractor and expects to deploy after his clearance is approved. Applicant has worked for Defense \ncontractors in the past, and he has also experienced periods of unemployment. During one such \nperiod he made six foreign trips, four of which were to Iraq that lasted more than 30 days each.  \nApplicant has numerous relatives and friends who are residents and/or citizens of Iraq. \nThese include his mother, who lives in Iraq with three of Applicant\u2019s siblings. Applicant speaks \nwith them weekly. He has other siblings who live in Iraq. They are married and live separately \nfrom their mother, and Applicant has weekly contact with them. Applicant has another sibling \nwho lives in a European country with whom he maintains weekly contact, either by phone or social \nmedia.  In addition to these close relatives, Applicant has numerous Iraqi cousins and friends with \nwhom he maintains regular contact. These include a cousin who is employed in law enforcement, \nanother cousin employed in a governmental capacity, and a friend from childhood who works for \nan Iraqi government ministry. Applicant contacts these persons on a weekly or monthly basis. \nApplicant has sent funds to his relatives and friends from time to time. He provides $10,000 to \nhis mother annually, and he has given money to other relatives and friends in amounts ranging \nfrom about $200 to about $2,500.  During his 2018 security clearance interview, he disclosed that \nhe had given at least $34,200 to his Iraqi contacts. Applicant has no property or financial interests \nin Iraq.  On the other hand, he owns no real estate in the U.S., although he has about $20,000 in a \nsavings account. \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of his prior work for DoD \ncontractors. A letter from a military official advised \u201cthat Applicant risked his life on numerous \noccasions in patrols and forays with coalition forces.\u201d Decision at 7. He has also been commended \nfor his loyalty, honesty, and capable performance of duty.  \nHuman rights problems are widespread in Iraq, such as arbitrary arrest, limitations on \nfreedom of speech and assembly, and discrimination based on gender, race, and religion. The U.S. \nState Department warns that U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist \nviolence. These threats are sufficiently grave as to require U.S. Government personnel to live and \nwork under strict security guidelines. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s trips to Iraq, his frequent contact with foreign \nrelatives and friends, and his financial support for them pose a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign \nexploitation as well as a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s desire to assist his Iraqi \nconnections and his obligation to protect classified information. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b\u204b \n7(a) and (b). In evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s \nprior work in support of U.S. objectives \u201cweighs in his favor.\u201d Decision at 11. However, he \nconcluded that the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts raise a real possibility that he \ncould come to the attention of forces interested in obtaining access to U.S. classified information \nand subjected to pressure. The Judge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s ties within the U.S. are not \nso significant as to outweigh his ties within Iraq. In his whole-person analysis the Judge noted \nApplicant\u2019s service to the U.S., which he characterized as \u201coutstanding.\u201d Decision at 12. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, he reiterated that Applicant\u2019s Iraqi family members and friends, with whom he maintains \nfrequent contact, entail a heightened risk of coercion that his evidence is not sufficient to mitigate. \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not \u201cgive proper weight\u201d to evidence of his prior \nservice in support of the U.S. Appeal Brief at 5. We acknowledge that the record contains \nevidence that Applicant has assumed significant risk to himself in the performance of his duties.  \nFor example, a 2010 memo by a military officer asserts that Applicant \u201chas risked his life in \nsupport of our operations . . . As an Iraqi national openly serving with U.S. forces, it is inevitable \nthat he is threatened as he assists the United States.\u201d Applicant Exhibit (AE) D. Another memo \nstates that \u201cduring [Applicant\u2019s] service with [military unit] he conducted numerous combat \npatrols, risked his life, and made enormous sacrifices in support of U.S. objectives.\u201d AE E. We \nhave long held that evidence of \u201csignificant contributions to U.S. national security in dangerous, \nhigh-risk circumstances is entitled to greater probative weight than evidence of mere compliance \nwith security rules and regulations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 13-00142 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2014). \nApplicant deserves the accolades that he has received for his bravery. However, each case must \nbe decided on its own merits. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). Even such evidence as described \nabove cannot, in and of itself, be dispositive. Rather, it must be evaluated in light of the entire \nrecord, with particular attention to evidence of circumstances that pose foreseeable risks to the \napplicant of pressure or coercion. In the case before us, the extent of Applicant\u2019s family members \nand other connections in Iraq, his frequent communication with them, and evidence that some of \nhis contacts are employed by the Iraqi government in one capacity or another, suggest the extent \nto which he could come to the attention of persons interested in acquiring U.S. classified \ninformation. In addition to this, we note a State Department report regarding Iraq, included in the \nofficial notice documents submitted by the Government, state that terrorism is a critical threat in \nBaghdad and terrorist groups remain capable of operating throughout the country. Iraq 2020 Crime \nand Safety Report: Baghdad, at 2. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, \n2015) to the effect that the presence of terrorist activity in a foreign country is an important \nconsideration that must be brought to bear upon a clearance decision.  \nApplicant\u2019s argument includes reference to other factors that he believes the Judge failed \nproperly to weigh, such as his U.S. savings account and what he terms merely casual contact with \nhis Iraqi relatives and friends. Given the totality of the record evidence, however, we conclude \nthat Applicant is expressing a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is \nnot enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Moreover, \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the \nrecord. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). We give due \nconsideration to the Hearing Office cases that Applicant has cited. However, as noted above, each \ncase must be decided upon its own merits. Moreover, Hearing Office decisions are binding neither \non other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Appeal Board. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAngelo Fernandez, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 31, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 20, 2022, after the record closed, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant purchased and used marijuana from \nabout 1994 to about 2019, that he was arrested for misdemeanor possession in 1996, that he used \nmarijuana while granted access to classified information, and that he intends to use it in the future.  \nThese same behaviors were cross-alleged under Guideline E. The Judge found favorably for \nApplicant on the allegation that he used while granted access. He found adversely on the \nremaining Guideline H allegations and on the Guideline E allegation. The favorable finding is not \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin issue. Applicant raises the following issue on appeal\u2014whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \nbroadly contends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 \nand the Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by mis-weighing the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. In his only specific \nassignment of error, Applicant\u2019s counsel argues that the Judge erred in adopting his Guideline H \nanalysis when he turned to the Guideline E allegations by stating \u201cThe analysis under Guideline \nH applies equally here. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.\u201d  Decision at 7. \nGuideline E and Guideline H have different mitigating factors; thus there can be no \nrational connection between the decision under Guideline H and Guideline E \nbecause different evidence is needed to support the different mitigating factors. \nEssentially, the [Judge] used the conclusion and analysis of Guideline H for \nGuideline E without balancing the evidence under Guideline E factors. [Appeal \nBrief at 6\u20137.] \nTo the extent that we understand counsel\u2019s argument, we are not persuaded. Contrary to \ncounsel\u2019s assertion, different evidence is not necessarily required to establish security concerns \nunder both guidelines. It is well-established that a judge may weigh the same evidence differently \nunder different guidelines. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03941 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2022). The \nJudge cited to the applicable mitigating conditions (MC) under both Guidelines: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26 (a) \u2013 \n(b) and MC \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c) \u2013 (e). Those conditions in fact closely mirror each other, and the Judge\u2019s \nanalysis under Guideline H was equally applicable under Guideline E. It did not need to be \nrepeated. This assignment of error is without merit. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). The \nHearing Office cases that Applicant\u2019s counsel has cited are easily distinguishable, not binding \nprecedent on the Appeal Board, and insufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On September 8, 2022, after consideration of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C.

He served on active duty from \n1994 through 2000, has held a security clearance since approximately 2000, and has worked for \ndefense contractors since at least 2010. The SOR alleged that Applicant owes delinquent \nFederal income taxes for tax year (TY) 2014 in the approximate amount of $11,400 and that he \nfailed to file Federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.  \nIn April 2021, Applicant responded to government interrogatories, adopted the summary of his \nclearance interview, and provided requested tax transcripts. In responding to interrogatories, Applicant \nprovided no proof that he had filed any of the Federal or state income tax returns alleged in the SOR, \nno proof of an established payment plan with any tax authority, and no proof of payments.   \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all SOR allegations and attributed the issue \nto procrastination and a failure to consider the matter a priority. Additionally, he stated that he \nwas in the process of remedying the tax issues. \n[Applicant] has failed to provide supporting documentation to demonstrate his \ngood-faith efforts to remedy this matter. There is insufficient information to determine \nthe amount of additional Federal or state tax debt he may owe, if any. He failed to take \nresponsible action to resolve his unfiled Federal and State A income tax returns for \nmultiple years and pay his tax delinquency. . . . A person who fails to address concerns, \neven after having been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is \nin jeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her \npersonal interests are at stake. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated.  [Decision at 4\u20135.] \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Counsel for Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific \nfindings of fact. Rather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and whole-person concept. \nCounsel argues repeatedly that the Judge did not give appropriate weight to \u201cevidence \nthat the Appellant had/has a plan in place to resolve his outstanding tax obligation.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 8, citing to Applicant\u2019s response to SOR and Interrogatories. Of note, the only plan that \nApplicant articulated in his answer to the SOR was the phrase \u201cIn Process to Remedy.\u201d SOR \nAnswer at 2\u20133. To the extent that Applicant stated a plan in his response to interrogatories, it \nwas \u201clocating paperwork to file.\u201d Item 4 at 5 and 7.  This argument by Counsel is frivolous. \nMoreover, Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s outstanding tax debt \u201chas been reduced to \napproximately $2,000, which is significant and something that was overlooked by the \nAdministrative Judge in her decision.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. This assertion is baseless and \nunsupported by the record evidence. Applicant disclosed a Federal tax debt of approximately \n$11,400 in his response to interrogatories and admitted to the same in his answer to the SOR. \nItem 4 at 6; SOR Answer at 2. He submitted no evidence that the Federal tax debt was reduced.  \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf Counsel seeks to introduce it now, cloaked in argument, the Appeal Board reminds Counsel \nthat the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.

    "summary": "Analysis of the Evidence Applicant asserts the three credit reports submitted with his SOR Response show meaningful resolution of his financial problems. He claims \u201c[c]redit reporting agencies do not remove a debt unless proof of resolution of a debt is provided, the owner of the debt reported the debt as paid in full, or the creditor fails [to] respond to disputed debts and provide factual evidence of current indebtedness of the applicant.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We do not find this argument persuasive. Applicant cites no authority supporting his claim. The fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish meaningful evidence as to the disposition of the debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00683 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018). Debts remain relevant for determining an individual\u2019s security clearance eligibility even if they have been deleted from credit reports due to the passage of time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). As the Board has previously noted, there is more than one plausible explanation for the absence of debts from a credit report, such as the removal of debts due to the passage of time, and the absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or mitigate an 2 overall history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT  \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 18, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord. On February 22, 2022, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and \nwhether the Judge failed to consider and weigh the evidence properly, resulting in a decision that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 11 delinquent debts totaling about $18,000. These \nincluded debts for unpaid rent, personal loans, and utilities. The Judge concluded that Applicant \nresolved two of the alleged debts and found in favor of him on those debts. The Judge found \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagainst him on the remaining debts, concluding no documentation was presented to show they \nwere paid or otherwise favorably resolved. Some of those unresolved debts no longer appear on \nhis most recent credit reports. In general, the Judge concluded Applicant presented insufficient \nevidence to mitigate the alleged security concerns.  \nDue Process Issue \nApplicant claims he was denied due process because he was not provided \u201cclear concise \ninformation required to dispute the Statement of Reasons in the file of relevant material (FORM).\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. He further contends that he was not informed his most recent credit reports \nsubmitted with his SOR Response would be insufficient to mitigate the alleged security concerns.  \nThese arguments lack merit. The Judge and Department Counsel have no obligation to provide an \napplicant guidance on how to rebut or mitigate SOR allegations. In fact, DOHA personnel are not \nauthorized to advise applicants on how to present their cases. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-02329 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015). \nOf note, Applicant was provided a copy of the Directive when he received the SOR. \nParagraph E3.1.15 of the Directive provides that an applicant is responsible for presenting \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or proven facts.  In this case, Applicant \nadmitted some of the SOR allegations and Department Counsel presented substantial evidence to \nprove other allegations. In the FORM, Department Counsel stated Applicant had the burden of \npresenting evidence to overcome the prima facie case against him and argued that Applicant failed \nto meet that burden, contending he presented insufficient mitigation in his SOR response. On \nNovember 3, 2021, Applicant was provided a complete copy of the FORM and was given 30-days \nfrom its receipt to submit additional information for the Judge\u2019s consideration. Applicant did not \nsubmit a response to the FORM.  \nIn essence, Applicant was notified of deficiencies in his SOR Response, was given an \nopportunity to submit additional evidence, and failed to do so. Applicant failed to establish that \nhe was denied any due process afforded by the Directive.  \nAnalysis of the Evidence \nApplicant asserts the three credit reports submitted with his SOR Response show \nmeaningful resolution of his financial problems. He claims \u201c[c]redit reporting agencies do not \nremove a debt unless proof of resolution of a debt is provided, the owner of the debt reported the \ndebt as paid in full, or the creditor fails [to] respond to disputed debts and provide factual evidence \nof current indebtedness of the applicant.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We do not find this argument \npersuasive. Applicant cites no authority supporting his claim. The fact that a debt no longer \nappears on a credit report does not establish meaningful evidence as to the disposition of the debt.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00683 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018). Debts remain relevant for \ndetermining an individual\u2019s security clearance eligibility even if they have been deleted from credit \nreports due to the passage of time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). As the Board has previously noted, there is more than one plausible explanation for the \nabsence of debts from a credit report, such as the removal of debts due to the passage of time, and \nthe absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or mitigate an \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverall history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). Additionally, even if a debt is \nresolved, a Judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debt as well as any previous \nactions or lapses to resolve the debt for what they reveal about security clearance worthiness. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02394 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015). It merits noting that the credit \nreports Applicant forwarded with his SOR Response reflect that he still has four longstanding, \ndelinquent debts totaling over $12,000, including a debt not alleged in the SOR. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017) for the proposition that non-alleged debts may be \nconsidered for certain purposes, such as determining whether an applicant has demonstrated \nrehabilitation and evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for extenuation or mitigation. \nApplicant also argues that most of his financial problems occurred long ago, were \ninfrequent, and happened under circumstance that are unlikely to recur. None of his arguments \nare enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or \nto show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-00362 at 4 (App. Bd. May 4, 2022). \nRequest for a Remand \nApplicant requests the Board remand the Judge\u2019s decision so that he may present additional \nevidence. It is well settled that absent a showing that an applicant was denied a reasonable \nopportunity to prepare for the proceeding below or was denied a reasonable opportunity to present \nevidence on his or her behalf, an applicant is not entitled to a remand just to have another chance \nto present his or her case. Id. at 5. If the Board were to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a remand or \nallow him to submit new evidence in this case, then the Board would be giving him special \ntreatment and denying other, similarly-situated applicants of their right to receive the fair, \nimpartial, and even-handed application of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive. Id. \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

She has worked for her current employer, a DoD contractor, \nsince early 2020. She has earned a master\u2019s degree and has held a security clearance since 2011.  \nThe record contains no evidence of security violations by Applicant. \nApplicant used methamphetamine in 2018 and again in 2019. She did so at a \u201clow point\u201d \nin her life while under the influence of a toxic relationship. In early 2020, Applicant traveled to a \ndifferent state from her place of residence, one in which the recreational use of marijuana is lawful.  \nShe used marijuana on one occasion while in that state. At the time of her illegal drug use, \nApplicant held a security clearance. She disclosed her methamphetamine use during the course of \nan Enhanced Subject Interview (ESI). She did not disclose the marijuana incident during the ESI; \nrather, she acknowledged it in response to subsequent DOHA interrogatories. She has expressed \na willingness to refrain from the use of illegal drugs in the future. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs raised concerns under Guideline \nH. He further concluded that Applicant\u2019s evidence did not mitigate those concerns. He noted that \nshe failed to inform the ESI interviewer about her use of marijuana and that she tested positive for \nmethamphetamine in a drug test performed as a condition of probation for unrelated offenses. He \nstated that he would consider these two non-alleged matters in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for \nmitigation, citing to ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). He emphasized that \nApplicant knew she held a clearance at the time of her offenses, and concluded that such \nknowledge enhanced the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct. Noting Applicant\u2019s evidence that \nshe used the drugs under the influence of others, he stated that such influence could re-emerge in \nfuture and that more time must elapse before Applicant can be held to have shown that her drug \nmisuse is truly behind her. \nDiscussion \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions. She argues \nthat her drug use was infrequent, that she has moved away from those who had influenced her \nbehavior in the past, that she has passed a drug evaluation during a period of probation, and that \nher character references show her to be trustworthy. This argument is, in effect, a disagreement \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. However, a Judge must evaluate the record evidence \nas a totality, and the presence of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable decision.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02990 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2022). We note, for example, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that she underwent a sort of drug evaluation during the course of her \nprobation. \u201cI got permission [to move to a different state] from both probation officers after \nrepeated positive drug tests, and also . . . I spoke to, I guess, a counselor.  She, basically, gave me \nan assessment . . . mental-health-wise . . . and I was allowed to move up here[.]\u201d Tr. at 27. While \nthis was evidence that the Judge was bound to consider, it does not satisfy the criteria set forth in \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 26(d): \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram . . . and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d All in all, \nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not persuade us that the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Neither are these arguments sufficient to rebut \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02862 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2020).  \nThe totality of Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal demonstrate no harmful error in the \nJudge\u2019s findings or analysis. An applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs after having completed a security \nclearance application or after otherwise having been placed on notice of the incompatibility of \ndrug abuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision.

Based on the facts of this case, \nthis error is harmless because it did not affect the outcome of the case. \nApplicant contends the Judge disregarded evidence regarding his ongoing child support \npayments, but he does not specify the exact nature of that evidence. In addressing the child support \narrearage allegation, the Judge found that Applicant presented an earnings statement for February \n2022 that showed a $253 child support deduction. Our review of the record reveals no other \ndocumentary evidence of child support payments. Applicant has failed to show the Judge erred in \nhis examination of the evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s other arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. None of his arguments are sufficient to establish that the Judge weighed the evidence \nin manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at \n5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal.

He has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a Federal contractor, since August 2019. He served in the U.S. military from \n2005 until 2017 and receives a disability pension due to service-connected post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD). \nIn completing his security clearance application (SCA) in 2019, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d \nto a question regarding whether he had ever had a clearance denied or revoked.1 In fact, in 2008, \nthe Government had revoked an existing clearance held by Applicant.

He attended a training \noffsite, where he engaged in sexual relations with a female coworker. Upon discovery of \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct, his employer fired him. \nApplicant lied to his wife about the \ncircumstances underlying his job termination and continued to do so until early 2021. He waited \nuntil then to tell her because he was afraid that he would lose his family. His current supervisors \nare not aware of this matter. \nA year earlier, while working as an intern at a state agency, Applicant and other employees \nunderwent a test of his job knowledge, during which he gave a fellow intern an answer to a test \nquestion. The state agency fired him. In 2015, while in the military, Applicant had an adulterous \naffair with a fellow service member. He attempted to cover up his misconduct by creating medical \nrecords that falsely reported that he was hospitalized during a timeframe that he actually spent with \nthe fellow service member. Applicant\u2019s commander gave him non-judicial punishment under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice. Applicant stated that he told his wife about the affair after \nstarting couple\u2019s therapy. He also disclosed that he had received individual therapy from the \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs arising from his PTSD diagnosis. \nApplicant received numerous awards and decorations while in the military. His current \nemployer has acknowledged Applicant\u2019s contributions to the company\u2019s mission, and his 2021 \nwork appraisal states that he \u201cmeets expectations.\u201d  Decision at 4. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge reiterated his finding that Applicant\u2019s explanation for his SCA omission was not \ncredible. He also cited to evidence that Applicant had lied about his affair while in the military \nand that his current chain of command is not aware of his subsequent incident of sexual \nmisconduct. He stated that Applicant had engaged in behavior that contravened the policies of \ntwo state agencies and the Federal Government; and that he had lied about his misconduct on \nnumerous occasions. Though acknowledging that Applicant has received counseling, the Judge \n1 Section 25 of Applicant\u2019s SCA included the following: \u201cHave you EVER had a security clearance eligibility/access \nauthorization denied, suspended, or revoked?\u201d Government Exhibit 1, SCA, at 45, emphasis in original. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nstated that the record did not contain sufficient evidence of changed circumstances to permit a \nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s misconduct is not likely to recur. He stated that, while Applicant \neventually disclosed to his wife his two incidents of adulterous misconduct and the true \ncircumstances of his 2019 job termination, \u201chis prolonged delay in each case placed him in a \nposition of vulnerability.\u201d \nDecision at 8. \nIn the whole-person analysis, the Judge noted \nApplicant\u2019s military service, combat deployments, awards and decorations, VA disability rating, \nand his family circumstances. However, he also noted evidence that Applicant had engaged in \ndeceitful behavior on multiple occasions and had failed to follow established rules set forth by the \nmilitary and by his employers.  He also cited to Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission on his SCA. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not explicitly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. However, he cites to \nHearing Office cases in which applicants\u2019 omissions or false statements were found to have been \ndue to misunderstandings rather than a result of deliberate intent to deceive. We construe citation \nto these cases as challenging the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant had deliberately provided a false \nanswer on his SCA. We have considered the challenged finding in light of the entirety of the \nrecord evidence. The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s explanation for this omission lacked \ncredibility is consistent with the evidence that was before him, and we give deference to Judges\u2019 \ncredibility determinations. Directive \u204b E3.1.32.1. We conclude that the challenged finding is \nsupported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Id. \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider significant record evidence, such as: \nhis acknowledgment of past mistakes; his treatment for PTSD; his marital counseling; and \nApplicant Exhibit J, his wife\u2019s declaration of support in which she advises that she is aware of the \ncircumstances underlying the SOR allegations and that Applicant enjoys the full support of his \nfamily and friends. On this last matter, although the Judge did not explicitly address the cited \nexhibit, he did find that Applicant had disclosed his infidelities to his wife. Regarding the other \nevidence cited in Applicant\u2019s brief, the Judge made findings about it and addressed it in his \nanalysis. Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence \nin the record, nor has he demonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. \n15, 2020). An ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the evidence is not enough to \nundermine a Judge\u2019s analysis. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020).  \nWe have given due consideration to the Hearing Office decisions referenced above, insofar as they \nbear upon the issues of mitigation and the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis. However, each case \nmust be decided upon its own merits. Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). Hearing Office decisions are \nbinding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Appeal Board. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02074 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019). The cited cases are not sufficient to undermine the \nJudge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s security concerns. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nJuly 13, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On July 5, 2022, after the record closed, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence and whether he misapplied the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent \nwith the following, we affirm. \nApplicant is 52 years old, divorced, with two teenaged children. He earned a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, served in the military for eight years, and subsequently earned a Master\u2019s degree.  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder both Guidelines D and J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested in 2007 and \ncharged with Enticement of Child by Adult and Furnishing Pornographic Material to a Minor; that \nhe was convicted of attempted enticement in 2012; that he served a sentence of five years\u2019 \nincarceration from 2012 to 2017; and that he is required to register as a sex offender.  \nApplicant admitted that he was convicted and sentenced as alleged.  However, he asserted \nthat he was factually innocent of the charge of Attempted Enticement of Child by Adult because \nhe believed the alleged victim was over the age of 18. The person Applicant attempted to entice \nfor sex was an undercover police officer posing online as a child.  \nApplicant pled not guilty at his state trial, but was convicted by a jury of the Attempted \nEnticement of a Child charge, a felony. He appealed the conviction to a state appellate court and \nfiled for relief in federal court, but both efforts were unsuccessful.  At hearing, he \u201cdenied that he \nintended to have sex with a child.\u201d  Decision at 5. \nAfter careful assessment of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, I conclude there \nis substantial reliable evidence of record that in October 2007, Applicant committed \nthe offense of Attempted Enticement of Child by Adult. He attempted to entice \n[Child] to engage in a sex act with him. I am satisfied that Applicant believed \n[Child] was under the age of 15 . . . . I am not persuaded that Applicant believed \n[Child] was 15 years or older. His [explanation of events] is not credible. Because \nhe was not truthful at his hearing about his mental state in October 2007 when he \ncommitted the offense, Applicant has not successfully rehabilitated himself \n(internal citations omitted.) While his offense in October 2007 is not recent, \nApplicant\u2019s lack of rehabilitation as shown by his false statement at his hearing \nshows lack of rehabilitation and continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  [Decision at 9\u201310.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact, but contends that \nthe Judge erred in two regards. \nFirst, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to adhere to the procedures required . . . when \nhe failed to consider all relevant evidence submitted by Appellant.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 4.  However, \ncounsel cites to no evidence that the Judge failed to consider.

Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel failed to comply with this fundamental requirement and failed to carry her burden on this \nissue.       \nSecond, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to apply properly both the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines D and J. Under Guideline D, Counsel for Applicant makes \nseveral arguments that are puzzling at best. First, she notes Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 12\u2019s \nadmonition that \u201cNo adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nsolely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual\u201d and then argues that the Judge was \n\u201cwrongfully biased against Applicant given the evidence from Applicant\u2019s criminal matter and \nthis inference (sic) was disregarded.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7. This case concerns conduct\u2e3aan adult \nmale\u2019s attempted enticement of a purported underage female\u2e3athat is devoid of any sexual \norientation issue whatsoever. Counsel\u2019s allegation of bias is wholly without foundation in the \nrecord. \nCounsel also represents\u2014without further explanation\u2014that AG \u00b6 13(a), sexual behavior \nof a criminal nature, was not established, as \u201c[s]exual behavior never occurred.\u201d Id. Applicant \nwas convicted in state court of Attempted Enticement of a Child, a felony. The Judge concluded \nbased on his review of the record evidence that Applicant committed the attempted enticement of \na child offense. Contrary to Counsel\u2019s assertion, the record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nGuideline D security concerns were established. \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant fundamentally argues that the criminal conduct security \nconcerns are mitigated by the passage of time\u201415 years\u2014without further incident. This argument \nis unpersuasive. In his decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s explanation of events \nsurrounding his arrest was not credible: \nBecause he was not truthful at his hearing about his mental state in October 2007 \nwhen he committed the offense, Applicant has not successfully rehabilitated \nhimself. . . . While his offense in October 2007 is not recent, Applicant\u2019s lack of \nrehabilitation as shown by his false statement at his hearing shows lack of \nrehabilitation and continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.  [Decision at 10.] \nThe Directive requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The Judge is well within his authority to consider that determination in \nassessing whether Applicant successfully rehabilitated himself and in evaluating whether he \nmitigated the Guideline J security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01577 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJun. 6, 2022). Moreover, when an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his \nown actions, such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 96-0360 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nJune 16, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord. On March 23, 2022, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Gregg A. Cervi denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of \nfact, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For \nthe reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Pakistan residing in the United States, \nand that his grandmother and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Pakistan. The Judge \nfound in favor of Applicant on the allegation regarding his wife and against him on the other \nallegations.

He has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor since 2020. Born in Pakistan, he was brought to the United \nStates just before his 18th birthday. While residing with his parents in the United States when they \nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens, he automatically became a U.S. citizen by operation of law. \nApplicant is also a citizen of Pakistan. In 2016, he obtained a Pakistani National Identity \nCard for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP). He used his Pakistani passport to visit Pakistan in 2009 \nand 2015, and used his U.S. passport and NICOP to travel there in 2017, 2018, and 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is an unemployed citizen and resident of Pakistan. He has visited \nher during his trips to Pakistan. He has monthly contact with her and described his relationship \nwith her as casual. His parents-in-laws are also citizens and residents of Pakistan. Since marrying \nin 2017, he has visited with his in-laws during trips to Pakistan. He has quarterly contact with his \nfather-in-law and monthly contact with his mother-in-law. His father-in-law is currently self-\nemployed in the clothing industry. Applicant is unaware of other information concerning the \nemployment history of his grandmother or parents-in-law. He did not provide documentary \nevidence of his financial status, community involvement, or employment performance. He \nprovided no character references. Since he chose to have a decision on the written record, the \nJudge noted he was unable to conduct inquiries at a hearing.  \n\u201cPakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups, and successive \nPakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even supported some of them as \nproxies in Pakistan\u2019s historical conflicts with its neighbors. \nTerrorists have targeted U.S. \ndiplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. . . . U.S. citizens have been kidnapped in other \ncountries and held in Pakistan.\u201d Decision at 2. In 2011, the Office of National Counterintelligence \nreported that sensitive U.S. economic information and technology was targeted by intelligence \nservices, research institutions, and citizens in dozens of countries, including Pakistan. \u201cIn 2019, \nthe U.S. Director of National Intelligence testified to \u2018Pakistan\u2019s recalcitrance in dealing with \nmilitant groups\u2019 and predicted that Pakistan will continue to threaten U.S. interests \u2018by developing \nnew nuclear weapons capabilities, maintaining its ties to militants, restricting counterterrorism \ncooperation, and drawing closer to China.\u2019\u201d Id. Due to terrorism and sectarian violence, the State \nDepartment issued a level-3 advisory (\u201creconsider travel\u201d) for Pakistan in early 2022. Id. at 3. \nGiven these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s family ties in Pakistan are sufficient to establish Guideline \nB disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant has provided very little background information on his \ngrandmother and in-laws living in Pakistan. Applicant maintains regular or \nrecurring contact with each person, and has visited often, but I do not know whether \ntheir family members in Pakistan have had any personal or political ties to or \nemployment with the Pakistani government, military, intelligence agencies, \ndefense establishment, or terrorist group. It is understandable that Applicant \nmaintains some ties to his and his spouse\u2019s family in Pakistan, but it is not credible \nthat he knowns (sic) very little about the family members\u2019 backgrounds after \nmaintaining telephone/Internet and personal contact over the years. Additionally, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe has not provided clear and convincing information regarding his financial status, \ncommunity involvement, employment performance, or personal and professional \ncharacter showing the degree of his ties and loyalty to the U.S.; information that \nwould have been helpful in establishing mitigating credit. Based on the record \npresented, I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s close ties to family members \nin Pakistan would not place him in a conflicted position. . . . Based on the paucity \nof information provided in the record, I am unable to find any of the mitigating \nconditions to be fully applicable.  [Decision at 7-8.] \nDiscussion \nNew Evidence \nThe Appeal Board is prohibited from receiving and considering new evidence on appeal.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. Interspersed throughout Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is information that was not \npresented to the Judge for consideration. This information constitutes new evidence that the \nAppeal Board cannot consider.   \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. We examine a Judge\u2019s \nchallenged findings to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant \nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the \ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02145 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in finding that he provided financial support to his wife \nbefore she moved to the United States. The evidence reflects that Applicant and his wife married \nin January 2017, that she moved to the United States in January 2018, and that he stated he \nprovided \u201c[d]aily or weekly support since this is my wife.\u201d Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) Item 3 at 9, Item 4 at 23 and 33, and Item 5 at 3. The Judge\u2019s finding that \nApplicant provided support to his wife before she moved to the United States was a reasonable \ninference drawn from the evidence. Applicant also argues the Judge erred in finding that he has \nno children, that he was brought to the United States just before his 18th birthday in 2012, and that \nhe used his Pakistani passport to travel to Pakistan in 2015 after becoming a U.S. citizen. These \narguments have merit. Pages 14-15 of FORM Item 3 reflect that he has a child. Pages 8 and 13 \nof FORM Item 4 reflect that he received a U.S. permanent resident card in 2007 and attended high \nschool in the United States from 2009 to 2013. Page 1 of FORM Item 5 reflects he traveled to \nPakistan in 2015 on his U.S. passport. Individually or collectively, however, these errors were \nharmless because they did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n03782 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2021). \nOther Purported Errors \nApplicant notes the Judge concluded that he failed to provide evidence about his financial \nstatus, employment performance, and personal and professional character, and he argues the SOR \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndid not list that such evidence was required. To the extent that he is challenging the adequacy of \nthe SOR, we do not find that argument persuasive. Applicants are entitled to receive reasonable \nnotice of the allegations being made against them so that they can have a meaningful opportunity \nto respond to the allegations. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 4.3.1-2 and E3.1.3. An SOR is not required to allege \nevery piece of evidence that is relevant and material to evaluating an applicant\u2019s security \neligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). In this case, the \nSOR was legally sufficient. It provided Applicant with adequate notice of the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B. \nAs a related matter, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief summarizes information from his security \nclearance application that is favorable to him, including matters regarding his employment \nactivities (Section 13A), police record (Section 22), and financial record (Section 26), and he \nargues the Judge failed to consider that information. In this summary, he intersperses new \nevidence regarding the quality of his work performance and his financial situation that we cannot \nconsider. His arguments based on that summary are insufficient to establish the Judge erred in \nanalyzing the evidence. More specifically, he has failed to rebut the presumption the Judge \nconsidered all the evidence in the record. This presumption is not rebutted merely because the \nappealing party can point to information in the record evidence that was not mentioned or \ndiscussed in the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09781 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, \n2002). \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s statement, \u201cit is not credible that [Applicant] knowns \n(sic) very little about the family members\u2019 backgrounds after maintaining telephone/Internet and \npersonal contact over the years.\u201d Decision at 7. The Appeal Board, however, is required to give \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination. Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s \ncredibility determination fail to provide any persuasive reason why we should not give it deference. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. For example, he argues that he has limited contact with his grandmother \nand in-laws, that those contacts are casual and do not raise foreign influence security concerns, \nand that he is not vulnerable to exploitation. However, an applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what \nhe might do in the future in a hypothetical situation is generally entitled to limited weight. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25202 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 22, 2008). Common sense and a knowledge of \nthe ways of the world suggest that even those whose character is unimpeachable, if faced with a \nserious dilemma, could be tempted to place the safety of loved ones ahead of other competing \ninterests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03991 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2021). Applicant\u2019s \narguments fail to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations. The burden \nwas on him to present evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns \narising from those allegations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nWe find no basis to disrupt the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant failed to meet his burden of production to mitigate the alleged security \nconcerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRequest for a Remand \nApplicant requests the Board remand the Judge\u2019s decision so that he may present additional \nevidence. It is well settled that absent a showing that an applicant was denied a reasonable \nopportunity to prepare for the proceeding below or was denied a reasonable opportunity to present \nevidence on his or her behalf, an applicant is not entitled to a remand just to have another chance \nto present his or her case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03347 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2016). If \nthe Board were to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a remand or allow him to submit new evidence in \nthis case, then the Board would be giving him special treatment and denying other, similarly-\nsituated applicants of their right to receive the fair, impartial, and even-handed application of \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive.

On \nJune 22, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing, during which \nthe SOR was amended upon Government motion. On May 10, 2022, after the record closed, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file State X income tax returns \nfor Tax Years (TYs) 2015 through 2019, Federal income tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2020, \nand State Y income tax returns for TYs 2019 and 2020. The Judge found against Applicant on all \nthree allegations.

After earning a doctorate in the late 1970s, he has spent \nhis career in the defense industry. Married since the mid-1980s, he has three adult children. In \n2012, Applicant and his spouse began caring for his elderly aunt. Although she resided in another \nstate, he was responsible for finding caregivers, managing her finances, and acting as healthcare \nproxy. \nIn 2014, Applicant resigned from long-term employment with a defense contractor in State \nY. In 2015, he secured employment in State X and relocated across the country. His spouse \nremained behind, in part to care for his elderly relative. Between 2016 and 2019, the aunt\u2019s \nmedical and healthcare situation grew more complex and demanded more of their time and \nattention, as they moved her first to an assisted living facility closer to his spouse and then to a \nsecond facility, while also taking responsibility for clearing out and selling her home. Applicant\u2019s \naunt died in July 2019. \nSince about 2012, Applicant and his spouse relied upon a certified public accountant (CPA) \nto file their tax returns. It was Applicant\u2019s responsibility to forward the necessary documents to \nthe CPA.  After Applicant moved to State X in 2015, some of the documents necessary to file the \nreturns were sent to him in State X and some were sent to the family home in State Y. Applicant \nattempted to sort through the documents on his monthly trips home. He filed their tax returns for \nTYs 2015 and 2016 late, either in 2018 or 2019.  \nApplicant did not file the couple\u2019s joint federal or State X tax returns on time for TYs 2017 \nor 2018. In Spring 2019, Applicant was laid off and moved back home. In July 2019, he started \nwork for his current employer in State Y. He did not file a tax return with the IRS or with States \nX and Y for TY 2019 when they were due. \nOn his June 2020 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he and his \nspouse had filed late for TYs 2015 and 2016 and had not yet filed for 2017 and 2018. He reported \nthat he did not know what, if anything, he owed to the IRS or State X for TYs 2017 and 2018. In \nAugust 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a security clearance background investigator. He \nconfirmed his failure to file for TYs 2017 and 2018 and stated his intent to contact the IRS to \nresolve the issue and pay any taxes owed. Both in his SCA and his interview, Applicant attributed \nhis failure to file to the difficulties of caring for his elderly relative and the challenges of living in \nState X, away from his spouse, from 2015 through 2019. \nIn February 2021, Applicant responded to interrogatories sent to him by the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency\u2019s Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DCSA CAF) and \nprovided the tax account transcripts requested. The IRS transcripts revealed that, as of January \n2021, his federal returns were still not filed for TYs 2017 and 2018. In a detailed statement \nsubmitted with the transcripts, Applicant again attributed his failure to file to the long-term \ndemands of caring for his aunt, the challenges of living and working remotely, and the logistical \nhurdles of cross-country moves and securing housing and employment. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn August 2021, Applicant and his spouse made a COVID-delayed trip to State X to clean \nout his condominium, put it on the market, and retrieve documents that he had left there. In March \n2022, he filed the delinquent state and Federal returns for tax years 2017 through 2020. Upon \nfiling, Applicant owed no additional taxes to either State X or State Y and instead received refunds \nfor each year. Upon filing his Federal returns for TYs 2017 through 2020, Applicant owed \nadditional sums for each year in taxes, interest, and penalties, in amounts ranging from $829 for \nTY 2017 to $16,000 for TY 2020.  Applicant paid all sums due at the time of filing.    \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant admitted that he and his spouse did not file their Federal and state income tax \nreturns when due for TYs 2015 through 2020. \u201cThere was no intent to evade paying taxes, \nalthough the recently filed tax returns show that they underpaid their federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2017 through 2020.\u201d  Decision at 9.  \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not comply with his \ntax-filing obligations. While Applicant rectified his TY 2015 and 2016 issues by November 2019, \nwell before the SOR was issued, his failure to file on time for TYs 2017 through 2020 undermines \nhis case in reform.  \nApplicant\u2019s delay in filing was due, in part, to circumstances beyond his control, \nparticularly the challenges of overseeing his aunt\u2019s medical care, making arrangements for her \nliving situation, and ultimately serving as executor of her estate. However, the delay was not \nentirely due to circumstances outside of his control. During his August 2020 interview with a \nbackground investigator, he stated he would contact the IRS within the following few days to \nresolve his tax issues. Despite receiving inquiries from the IRS in December 2018 and March \n2020, interrogatories from the DCSA CAF in early 2021, and his SOR in June 2021, Applicant \nhad not filed his delinquent returns for tax years 2017 through 2020 by the end of 2021.  \nApplicant belatedly filed his state and Federal returns and paid the federal taxes owed.  \nHowever, under Appeal Board precedent, the timing of corrective action is a factor to consider, as \napplicants who only begin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice \nthat their clearance may be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when \ntheir immediate interests are not imperiled.  \n[Applicant\u2019s] lack of urgency in addressing his tax issues is incompatible with the \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness expected of him, based on his education \nand experience with the clearance process. The financial considerations security \nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s repeated and recent failure to comply with his tax-\nfiling obligations are not fully mitigated at this time.  [Decision at 11.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges several aspects of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. First, he takes issue \nwith her use of the terms \u201cState X\u201d and \u201cState Y.\u201d Applicant notes that these terms fail to convey \nthe logistical difficulties of traveling to help his wife and aunt on the East Coast while working \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nremotely on the West Coast. The Judge\u2019s use of generic terms, however, simply complies with \nDOHA protocols in place to protect the privacy of applicants. She clearly considered that this was \na cross-country effort, as she refers explicitly to Applicant\u2019s \u201crelocat[ing] across the country.\u201d \nDecision at 3. Moreover, the Judge thoroughly recites the multifaceted logistical challenges of \narranging for the relative\u2019s care, his wife\u2019s dedicated efforts, and his assistance from across the \ncountry. See Decision at 3, 5. \nIn another example, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthe recently filed tax \nreturns show that they underpaid their federal income taxes for tax years 2017 through 2020.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 4, quoting Decision at 9. Applicant asserts that \u201c[i]t should be noted and corrected \nin the Decision that not only have I paid overdue federal taxes, but I have also paid all penalty fees \nas well as interest on the overdue taxes,\u201d and that the Judge should \u201cprovide the detailed numbers \nand their source to illuminate this alleged underpayment.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. Applicant misreads \nthe Judge\u2019s decision, which clearly states that the couple \u201cpaid the taxes owed when they submitted \ntheir tax returns.\u201d Decision at 6. In the statement at issue, the Judge was commenting\u2014 \naccurately\u2014that Applicant owed taxes upon filing late. In summary, we find no merit in \nApplicant\u2019s various assertions of error in the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. \nAdditionally, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to apply the mitigating conditions \nproperly. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to properly weigh the challenges of \ncaring for his elderly relative, the difficulties of working far from his family, and the logistics of \ntwo cross-country moves. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, our review of the record and the \nJudge\u2019s decision confirms that the Judge considered all the evidence presented, including those \ncircumstances cited by Applicant in his appeal. In her decision, the Judge thoroughly explored all \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F before concluding that none of the mitigating conditions \nfully apply. \nAs the Judge noted, the timing of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent tax filings \nis relevant, as an applicant who begins to resolve financial concerns only after his clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment to follow rules and regulations when his personal interests are not \nthreatened. Decision at 11. That assertion is well grounded in the Appeal Board precedent to \nwhich the Judge cites. The fact that Applicant has recently corrected his Federal and state tax \nproblems does not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s prior behavior and how it reflects \non his security worthiness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges three delinquent student loan accounts in the total amount of a \nlittle over $123,000 and a delinquent credit card debt of about $2,700. Applicant did not disclose \nthe student loans on his security clearance application but acknowledged them during his \nsubsequent interview. He told the interviewer that they were for his son\u2019s college education and \ndid not provide a reason for their delinquency. In his SOR answer Applicant denied responsibility \nfor the loans, contending that his wife handled the financial matters associated with their children\u2019s \neducation and that he was unaware that he was listed as solely responsible for the debts arising \ntherefrom. In his response to the File of Relevant Material Applicant claimed that he was disputing \nthe student loans but would pay them were his disputes unsuccessful. The Judge found Applicant\u2019s \nvarious contentions about his liability for the student loans to be lacking in credibility. She cited \nto his acknowledgment of the loans during his clearance interview and to evidence that his children \nhad received the economic benefit of these loans by using the proceeds to fund their education.  \nShe noted evidence that Applicant\u2019s name is on the promissory notes, establishing his liability for \nthe debts. She concluded that Applicant had not presented evidence of debt resolution sufficient \nto mitigate the SOR concerns and entered adverse findings for all four allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot \nconsider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  He states that he understands that the Judge\u2019s decision \u201cwas made \naccording to the laws\u201d but believes it unfair that he should be held responsible for debts of which \nhe was unaware at the time they were incurred. Appeal Brief at 1. We construe this argument to \nmean that, while the Judge\u2019s findings about his formal liability on the student loans were legally \ncorrect, her adverse decision did not reflect an accurate assessment of his judgment and reliability. \nThe Judge made findings about Applicant\u2019s claim that he was not aware of his liability for the \nstudent loans, and she addressed it in her analysis. Her conclusion that Applicant lacked credibility \non this matter is sustainable. We give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 20-00290 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2022). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.
