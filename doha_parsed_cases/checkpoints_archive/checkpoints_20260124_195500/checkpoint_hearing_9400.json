His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on August 17, 2007. On May 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 3, \nSeptember 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. I convened a hearing on September 2, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called two witnesses. He introduced nine exhibits, which \nwere identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through I. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection, with the exception of Ex. D. Department Counsel \nobjected to the admission of Ex. D because it was an incomplete document. I noted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objection, and I also left the record open for one calendar week, \nuntil September 9, 2009, so that Applicant could provide a copy of the complete \ndocument for the record.   \n \nOn September 9, 2009, Applicant timely filed five additional documents, including \na complete copy of the document that had been identified at the hearing as Ex. D and \nadmitted on the condition that he provide a complete copy of the document for the \nrecord. Without objection, Applicant\u2019s Ex. D was admitted to the record. Additionally, \nApplicant filed a request for the record to remain open to receive additional information \nfrom him and three additional documents, which I identified and marked as Ex. J, Ex. K. \nand Ex. L. Applicant\u2019s request that the record remain open was marked as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) 1 and retained in the record.  Ex. J, Ex. K, and Ex. L were admitted to the \nrecord without objection. \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request, and the record was left open for an additional \ncalendar week, until close of business September 16, 2009. Applicant timely filed two \nadditional exhibits, which I identified and marked as Ex. M and Ex. N and admitted to \nthe record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nSeptember 9, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted the three allegations but denied that they constituted disqualifying \nconditions under AG F. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer \nto SOR; Tr. 66-67, 79-80.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and the father of four young children. From \n1995 to 2002, he served on active duty in the military. Since 2002, he has been \nemployed as a security officer by a government contractor. He seeks a security \nclearance.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 63-64.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take-home pay is approximately $4,500. He also has a part-\ntime job as a church organist, from which he earns about $200 a month. His monthly \nfixed expenses are as follows: rent, $1,200; groceries, $400; clothing, $150; utilities, \n$200; \nautomobile \ninsurance \nand \nmaintenance, \n$470; \ncar \npayment, \n$650; \nmiscellaneous, $100. His monthly net remainder is approximately $1,530. Applicant is \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe sole support of his family. Since 2003, his wife has not been employed outside of \nthe home. (Ex. 3 at 5; Ex. I; Tr. 86-89, 91-92.) \n \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant purchased a home for $120,000.  Applicant and his \nfamily lived in the home until about May 2005, when he purchased a second home for \n$281,000 and moved his family into the second home. In June 2005, he rented his first \nhome to a tenant. (Tr. 67-70.)  \n \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant refinanced the mortgage on the second home. The \nrefinance paid off the original mortgage on the home and resulted in a new first \nmortgage with the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.b. and a second mortgage with the \ncreditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.a. After the refinance, Applicant\u2019s monthly payments were \n$1,700 on the first mortgage and $650 on the second mortgage. (Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 67.) \n \n \nApplicant was also responsible for paying the mortgage on his first home. He \nintended to use the rent he acquired from his tenant to pay the mortgage on the first \nhouse. Applicant\u2019s tenant, however, was, at times, late in paying her rent. She also \nfailed on other occasions to pay her rent to Applicant. Applicant tried to cover the \nmortgages on both homes, but was unable to do so. He fell about six months behind in \nhis mortgage payments on both homes. (Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 69-71.) \n \n \nApplicant took action to have the tenant evicted, and, in January 2007, she was \nevicted. Between January and April 2007, the property was vacant. In April 2007, \nApplicant sold the first home to an investor, who purchased the property for $232,000. \nThe investor paid the back rent that had been owed by the tenant and brought Applicant \ncurrent on the mortgage. The investor now pays the mortgage on the property, which \nremains in Applicant\u2019s name until the property is sold. Applicant and the investor have \nan agreement that when the property is sold, Applicant will receive approximately \n$57,000 of the sale proceeds. To date, the investor has been unable to sell the \nproperty, and he currently rents it to tenants. (Ex. 3 at 7-8; Ex. D; Ex. F; Tr. 73-77.) \n \n \nApplicant continued to fall behind in his mortgage payments for his second home. \nIn February 2008, he and his family moved out of the home. He tried to sell the home, \nbut he was unable to do so. The property went into foreclosure and was sold at auction. \nAfter the foreclosure, Applicant owed $59,708 to the holder of the second mortgage.  \nThis debt has not been satisfied and is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. After the foreclosure, \nApplicant also owed $31,220 to the holder of the first mortgage. This debt has not been \nsatisfied and is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Ex. H; Tr. 68, 79.) \n \n \nIn December 2008, the holder of the first mortgage contacted Applicant and \noffered to settle the $31,220 debt for $9,381. In order to qualify for the settlement, \nApplicant was required to pay the creditor $50 a month from December 2008 through \nMarch of 2009. Applicant made one or two payments under the agreement but then \nfailed to make the other required payments. He stated that he didn\u2019t get around to \nmaking the payments, but he stated that it was his intention to make such payments in \nthe future. He provided documentation to show that he made one $100 payment to the \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncreditor in August 2009. At his hearing, he stated that the creditor had agreed to accept \npayments on the debt of $100 a month, and he stated he would provide a copy of that \nagreement as a post-hearing submission. Applicant failed to submit the documentation \ncorroborating his agreement with the creditor to accept monthly payments of $100 on \nthe debt. Instead, he provided a settlement offer from the creditor, dated September 4, \n2009, offering to settle the $30,972 debt for approximately half of the balance, or \n$15,486. (Ex. 2 at 2; Ex. A; Ex. L; Ex. N; Tr. 79-84.) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that the $59,708 debt to the holder of the second \nmortgage had not been satisfied. He acknowledged that, in January 2009, the creditor \nhad offered him a loan modification agreement whereby he would make an initial \npayment of $605 to the creditor and then would make $310 monthly payments, \nbeginning March 1, 2009. Applicant stated that he had not agreed to the loan \nmodification offer but had, instead, made one payment of $100 to the creditor in August \n2009. He provided documentation to corroborate the $100 payment. He stated that he \nintended to make payments of $100 each month to the creditors identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. and 1.b. until he satisfied both debts. (Ex. 3 at  11; Ex. L; Tr. 84-86, 90-91.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $168 to a creditor \non a cable bill. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) Applicant paid the creditor $163 on the debt, and he \nprovided documentation establishing that $163 had been paid from his checking \naccount to the creditor. He did not provide documentation to establish that the creditor \nconsidered the $163 as payment in full on the debt. (Ex. L; Tr. 93-94.)  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant reported that he was not current on his cable bill and he \nwas one month late in paying his car note. He has not had credit counseling.  He has \nconsidered filing for bankruptcy. (Ex. J; Ex. K; Tr. 84-86, 94-95.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and a family friend appeared as witnesses on his behalf. His \nfather praised Applicant as a very good son and a man of character, integrity, and faith. \nThe family friend described the financial hardships that Applicant experienced with the \ndownturn of the housing market. She stated that he had discussed filing for bankruptcy. \n(Tr. 40-43, 58-61.) \n  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in 2005 and 2006 when he was unable to \nsustain the financial responsibilities of owning two homes. He could not meet his \nmortgage payments on the two properties, and he was unable to sell them because of \nthe downturn in the housing market. While Applicant was directly affected by the \ndownturn in the real estate market and was subject to events beyond his control, he \n\n \n7 \n \n \nalso elected to purchase and pay for two properties on a single income. Some of his \ncreditors sought to offer him settlements. However, Applicant failed to work with his \ncreditors. He did not follow through on payment arrangements with his creditors, \nthereby demonstrating a failure to act responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \n Applicant\u2019s inability to pay his mortgages caused him to become financially \noverextended. While he has a modest monthly remainder, his delinquent debts total \nalmost $91,000, and he has few resources available to pay them at this time. He hopes \nto pay his creditors in the future, but he has difficulty meeting his basic expenses each \nmonth and has fallen behind in paying his cable bill and his car note, a situation which \ncasts doubt on his ability to plan realistically for the future. He provided documentation \nto corroborate that he had paid $163 on a delinquent cable bill, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nHowever, he failed to establish that he had acted responsibly in dealing with the \nfinancial delinquencies that grew out of his failure to pay his mortgages and resulted in \nthe substantial debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.    \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. While he admitted his financial \ndelinquencies, it was not clear that he understood his financial problems or how to \nresolve them. He has no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial \ndelinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that while AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies in part to Applicant\u2019s case, none of the other Financial Considerations mitigating \nconditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 34 \n\n \n8 \n \n \nyears. He is appreciated by his family, friends, and community. He has been steadily \nemployed for seven years since leaving military service. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began almost five years ago. He has not pursued \nfinancial counseling. His lack of attention to his financial delinquencies continues to \nraise security concerns. Despite a steady income for several years, and a net remainder \nof approximately $1,500 a month, he failed to budget his income to satisfy his \ndelinquent financial obligations, raising concerns about his judgment and potential \nfinancial vulnerability. \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s financial situation arises from unusual circumstances, and \nhe may find it beneficial to seek professional financial counseling and legal advice about \nresolving his debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term. Applicant can \nreapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this decision becomes final.  \nIf he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the Government\u2019s current \nsecurity concerns at that time.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:    \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old and is married with four children. In 2003, Applicant purchased a home. In 2005, Applicant purchased a second home and moved into it with his family, intending to pay the mortgage on the first home with rent from a tenant. When the tenant fell behind on her rent, Applicant fell behind on his mortgage payments for both houses. The house in which Applicant was living went through foreclosure, and Applicant now rents a home. Applicant still owes over $90,000 to the holders of the first and second mortgages on the second home. Applicant sold the first home to an investor, who brought the mortgage payments up to date. The investor currently makes the mortgage payments, but the mortgage debt will remain in Applicant\u2019s name until the property is sold. Applicant testified that he is behind on current bills. Applicant has considered filing for bankruptcy.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 28, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\n\n2\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old and is\nmarried with four children.  In 2003, Applicant purchased a home.  In 2005, Applicant purchased\na second home and moved into it with his family, intending to pay the mortgage on the first home\nwith rent from a tenant.  When the tenant fell behind on her rent, Applicant fell behind on his\nmortgage payments for both houses.  The house in which Applicant was living went through\nforeclosure, and Applicant now rents a home.  Applicant still owes over $90,000 to the holders of\nthe first and second mortgages on the second home.  Applicant sold the first home to an investor,\nwho brought the mortgage payments up to date.  The investor currently makes the mortgage\npayments, but the mortgage debt will remain in Applicant\u2019s name until the property is sold.\nApplicant testified that he is behind on current bills.  Applicant has considered filing for bankruptcy.\nApplicant\u2019s father appeared as a character witness, and a family friend described the financial\ndifficulties that Applicant experienced due to the downturn in the housing market.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nIn his appeal, Applicant describes the cause of his financial circumstances and his efforts to\nimprove the situation.  To the extent that the information was not in the record below, it is new\nevidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The submission of\nnew evidence does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n00184 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nApplicant objects to some of the Judge\u2019s statements concerning his financial situation.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s objections are based at least in part on new evidence which was not before\nthe Judge.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are\nbased on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be\ndrawn from the record.  The statements are therefore sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24013\nat 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2008).\nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2\n(May 23, 2008).\nApplicant requests that he be allowed time to satisfy his debts while maintaining a security\nclearance.  This request could be construed as either (a) a request for a conditional security clearance,\n\n3\nor (b) an argument that the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision should not be affirmed because it will result\nin adverse financial consequences for Applicant.  Under the Directive, there is no authority for a\nHearing Office Judge or the Board to grant a conditional security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-08107 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2005).  Moreover, the possible effect a security clearance\ndecision could have on an applicant\u2019s economic situation is not relevant or material to whether a\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at\n8 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-00899 at n. 1 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008).\n\u201cThe adverse impact of a clearance decision on an applicant is not relevant or material to an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility.\u201d  Accordingly, Applicant requests relief to which he is not entitled.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 29, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 27, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815.  A commander may impose non-judicial punishment on a member subject to his command\n1\nfor violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  A member may refuse non-judicial punishment and demand trial\nby court-martial.  \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 5, Court Memorandum, states that Applicant was offered non-judicial punishment\n2\nunder Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, for six specifications of failure to obey an order or regulation and\none specification of assault.  This exhibit states that Applicant was notified of his right to decline non-judicial\npunishment.  He accepted non-judicial punishment after having consulted an attorney.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Department Counsel improperly\ncharacterized the evidence; whether Applicant\u2019s prior grant of a clearance by a Federal agency\nshould be given reciprocity; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software engineer for\na Defense contractor.  He served in the Navy from 1997 to 2005 and has held a security clearance\nsince 1998.  \nWhile in the Navy, he received non-judicial punishment for failure to obey an order or\nregulation and for assault.   Applicant testified that he was investigated for sexual harassment and\n1\nfraternization.  He denied guilt.2\nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant worked for a Defense contractor, Company A.  However,\nhe lost his job when his employer lost its contract.  In searching for a new job, Applicant stated on\nhis resume that he was a Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP).  In fact, he\nwas not so certified but was studying to take the exam.  After he was hired by a different company,\nCompany B, he did not inform his new employer that he in fact was not a CISSP.  When asked to\npresent a copy of his certification, Applicant obtained a false one from a web site that generated false\ndiplomas and certificates.  He gave this document to the program manager but, realizing that he had\ndone wrong, resigned the next day.\nHe found other employment, but this company, Company C, also lost its contract.  He went\nback to work for Company A.  While employed there he took a second job with Company D.  In\nAugust 2009, Applicant was terminated from this second job for inaccurate time keeping.  He had\ntaken time off to attend classes, but he had certified to Company D that he was at work.  \nApplicant enjoys a reputation for being hard-working, conscientious, and trustworthy.  While\non active duty, his performance reports stated that he met or exceeded standards.  He also received\nseveral awards, including the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.  \nApplicant contends that Department Counsel characterized the record evidence in an\nimpermissible manner, thereby resulting in the Judge rendering an unfavorable decision.  For\nexample, he argues that Department Counsel wrongly stated that he had been discharged from the\nNavy for assault.  We have examined the record, noting that Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214 merely states\nthat he was discharged for having committed a \u201cserious offense,\u201d without going into detail.  GE 4.\nHowever, Applicant admitted on cross examination that he had been discharged as a result of his\n\nnon-judicial punishment, which included assault as one of the alleged offenses.  Tr. at 78; GE 5.  He\nfurther argues that Department Counsel erred by making his false statement regarding CISSP appear\nto be more serious than it actually was.  He also contends that Department Counsel erred in arguing\nthat his violation of Company D policy concerning second jobs was knowing and willful.   \nWe have examined Applicant\u2019s contentions in light of the record.  We see no reason to\nbelieve that Department Counsel impermissibly characterized the evidence, either while questioning\nApplicant or during her closing argument.  In any event, comments by Department Counsel are not\nbinding on the Judge.  In this case, the Judge\u2019s findings and analysis are consistent with the evidence\nand reflect her own independent interpretation of the record.  \nApplicant states that he was previously granted a clearance by another agency and that\nDOHA should extend reciprocity to that earlier adjudication.  This issue was raised at the hearing,\nand the Judge held the record open, providing both sides an opportunity to submit matters addressing\nreciprocity.  In her decision, the Judge properly concluded that Applicant was not entitled to\nreciprocity, because his most recent job termination for cause, in August 2009, had not been included\nin the prior adjudication.  See DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating\nManual, February 28, 2006 \u00b6 2-204. \nApplicant contends that the Judge either ignored or mis-weighed record evidence, for\nexample his having held a clearance without incident or concern and his evidence of good character\nand devotion to duty.    \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).  In this case, the Decision demonstrates that the Judge\nconsidered the evidence cited by Applicant but that she reasonably explained why she concluded that\nhe had failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.  Furthermore, Applicant has not\nprovided a reason to believe that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).\nAfter considering the record, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions\nor whole-person factors.\nApplicant states that he is willing to undergo \u201cany probationary periods the [B]oard may want\nto set in place.\u201d  Applicant Brief at 2.  However, we have no authority to grant a conditional or\nprobationary clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-04889 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On October 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the  adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nDecember 31, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 12, 2010. The hearing \nwas originally scheduled for February 11, 2010, but was cancelled due to inclement \nweather. On February 23, 2010, a Notice of Hearing was issued, rescheduling the \nhearing for March 17, 2010. The case was heard on that date. The government offered \neight exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1\u20138. Applicant \ntestified and submitted no documents. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 25, \nApril 27, 2010\n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n2\n2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant presented evidence that another defense agency \ngranted him eligibility for access to SCI on November 12, 2009. (Applicant\u2019s counsel \nmentioned he was granted a Top Secret/SCI clearance. The memo indicates Applicant \nwas granted eligibility for SCI access. It is likely his Top Secret clearance was still valid. \n(see AE F)) This fact raised an issue of whether Applicant should be given reciprocity in \naccordance with section 2-204 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating \nManual (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006. Section 2-204 of the NISPOM states, in \npart: \n \nAny previously granted PCL that is based upon a current investigation of a \nscope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the clearance required \nshall provide the basis for a new clearance without further investigation or \nadjudication unless significant derogatory information that was not \npreviously adjudicated becomes known to the granting agency.  \n \n \nI held the record open until March 31, 2010, to allow the parties to submit a \nresponse pertaining to the reciprocity issue. Both parties submitted a timely response. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant\u2019s exhibit \nis marked as HE II.  \n \n \nApplicant contends that because another defense agency granted a personal \nclearance/access eligibility to the Applicant based upon a current investigation of a \nscope that met or exceeded that necessary for the clearance required Applicant should \nbe issued a security clearance without the requirement of further investigation or \nadjudication. As a result, Applicant\u2019s counsel requests that the SOR be withdrawn. It is \nnoted that Applicant\u2019s current supervisor provided a statement indicating a February \n2008 incident report which concerns the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.g was considered \nwhen adjudicating Applicant\u2019s SCI access which was granted on November 12, 2009. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel contends that reciprocity does not apply because the SOR \naddresses matters that were not previously adjudicated, specifically, Applicant\u2019s job \ntermination for cause in August 2009. Department Counsel admits that the other \ndefense agency may have been aware of the February 2008 incident report when \nadjudicating his SCI access.    \n \n \nI find that reciprocity does not apply in Applicant\u2019s case because Applicant\u2019s \ntermination for cause in August 2009 is additional derogatory information that was not \nconsidered when adjudicating Applicant\u2019s SCI access.  \n \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n3\n \nOn another procedural issue, Department Counsel withdrew the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c during the hearing.

His punishment included a reduction in rank from E-5 to E-4, 40 days restriction \nand extra duty, and forfeiture of $400 pay per month for two months. (Gov 5) The record \ndoes not go into detail pertaining to the facts that support the underlying offenses. \nApplicant testified that he was implicated in an investigation involving 25 other \nindividuals related to selling orders for sex. He was not involved in the selling orders for \nsex offenses but was investigated for sexual harassment and fraternization charges. \nAlthough he was not an instructor, he apparently had asked out a female trainee and \nmay have touched her on the shoulder. He denies that he was guilty of the offenses \nalleged in the NJP.  (Tr. 31-33, 78-81; Gov 3 at 3-4) \n \nOn October 20, 2005, Applicant was involuntarily discharged from the United \nStates Navy with a discharge characterized as general (under honorable conditions) \ndischarge. The reason for the discharge was misconduct (serious offense). Applicant \nappeared before a discharge board before he was separated. (Gov 4; AE C)   \n \nWhen he separated from the Navy, Applicant worked for one employer for four \nmonths until he found employment with a large defense contractor (Company A) in \nMarch 2006. From March 2006 to November 2006, he worked at one location. In \nNovember 2006, he switched contracts and locations while still employed by Company \nA. (Tr. 86) In October 2007, Company A lost the contract, leaving Applicant without a \njob. At the time his sons were about a year old and his wife was not working. (Tr. 37, \n40-42, 86; Gov 3 at 11) \n \nAfter two weeks of unemployment, Applicant decided to list on his resume that he \nwas a Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP) in order to improve \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n4\nhis chances of being interviewed. Applicant was studying for his CISSP certification but \ndid not have the certification when he listed it on his resume. He decided that he could \nlist it on his resume and would have the certification by the time a prospective employer \nasked for proof. (Tr. 43, 88-89; Gov 3 at 11) \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant was interviewed and hired by Company B. During \nthe interview, the program manager told him that it was great that he had his CISSP \ncertification but it was not needed for a year. Instead of telling the program manager \nthat he did not have the certification, Applicant said nothing because he thought it would \ngive him more time to complete the certification. (Tr. 90-91; Gov 3 at 11) His program \nmanager had a heart attack. The program manager who was in charge of the \ncertification program for Company B replaced him.  While on sick leave in late 2007, \nApplicant was sent an e-mail from the new program manager asking for his CISSP \ncertification.  Instead of telling the program manager that he did not have a CISSP \ncertification, Applicant obtained a false certification document from a web-site that \ngenerated diplomas and certifications for a fee.  He paid about $200 for the service. \nAfter he received the false CISSP certification, he sent it to the program manager. He \ntestified that he knew he had crossed a line so he resigned the next day. This occurred \nin February 2008. (Tr. 46-50, 91-94; Gov 3 at 11-12)  \n \nApplicant states that this conduct was completely out of character for him. Being \na new father and the only income-provider for his family contributed to his subsequent \nbad decisions. He does not intend to repeat similar conduct in the future. (Tr. 72-73, \n119; Gov 3 at 12)  \n \nAfter he resigned from Company B, Applicant was unemployed for one and a half \nmonths. When he interviewed with Company C, he informed them about his false \nCISSP certification but was hired anyway. He later discovered that Company B sent in \nan incident report regarding the false CISSP certification related to his security \nclearance. In April 2008, he started to work for Company C. After about a month, \nCompany C lost the contract and Applicant needed to find a new job. He worked as \ncontractor for another government agency for a few months until he was hired back by \nCompany A. He has worked for Company A since November 2008. (Tr. 52-59, 97-98) \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant was hired by Company D.  This was a second full-time \njob. He was still employed full-time with Company A. He claims that his program \nmanager at Company D was aware that he worked another full-time job. (It was actually \nhis program manager at the work place who worked for the company who had the prime \ncontract. Applicant\u2019s employer was a subcontractor.) On August 24, 2009, the Director \nof Human Resources from Company D notified Applicant that he was being terminated \nfor inaccurate timekeeping. Applicant took time off to attend classes. Applicant believed \nthat as long as he put his days off on the office calendar \u201cit was okay.\u201d He certified his \ntime cards before being paid twice a month. He did not list the time taken off to attend \nclasses on his timesheets. At times, he would take days off and not indicate the days off \non his timesheets. At the end of each pay period, he verified that the documentation \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n5\nprovided was true and accurate to the best of his knowledge. He also believed that his \ncontract was not based on hours but on deliverables. (Tr. 60-67; Gov 6 at 2-3) \n \nCompany D\u2019s Director of Human Resources mentioned in an e-mail dated \nAugust 24, 2009, that she reminded Applicant that he had signed off on the company\u2019s \ntimesheet policy and the acknowledgment of the company handbook which stated \nCompany D\u2019s policies regarding total time accounting and timekeeping. (Gov 6 at 3-4) \nApplicant testified that he never received a copy of Company D\u2019s handbook or \ntimesheet policy. He also never received ethics training. (Tr. 64-67, 99, 101-105) \n \nApplicant testified that he believed that he was allowed paid time off to attend \nclasses. He put the dates that he was at class on the public calendar and sent e-mails. \nHe did not have a written agreement with Company D indicating that he could take paid \ntime off to attend classes. He was told by the Human Resource Advisor that in \ngovernment contracting you cannot claim for hours worked for a contract task unless \nyou actually worked those hours. (Tr. 111-114; Gov 6 at 9) \n \nThe deputy project manager of the company that had the prime contract when \nApplicant worked for Company D wrote a letter stating that Applicant worked with him \non a daily basis from 2008 to 2009. He describes Applicant as an \u201chonest, hard working \nand dedicated individual.\u201d When he learned that Applicant was terminated for inaccurate \ntimekeeping, he told his superiors that he believed there was a miscommunication. He \nbelieved the company that owned the prime contract and the government contractor \napproved Applicant\u2019s time away from the contract in order to attend classes. He states \nApplicant always let the Government and management know when he was not at work \nand taking classes. (I give the deputy project manager\u2019s assertions less weight because \nhe did not testify and was not subject to cross examination.) The deputy project \nmanager was also aware that Applicant was working a second job. He looks forward to \nworking with Applicant on future projects. He believes that if Applicant is not granted a \nsecurity clearance, it would be an unfortunate loss for the national interest of the United \nStates. (AE A)  \n \nCompany D had a policy that required employees to report outside employment \nto their immediate supervisor, group general manager, staff vice president, or ethics \ncompliance officer. It would then be determined whether the outside employment would \nbe permitted. Although Applicant told the deputy project manager that had the prime \ncontract that he had another full-time job, it is unlikely he informed his superiors at \nCompany D. I make this conclusion based on Company D\u2019s Human Resource Director\u2019s \nasking him on the day of his termination whether this was the first time he worked for a \ngovernment contractor. (Gov 6 at 3; Gov 8; AE A)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s current government supervisor wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nHe is a retired Sergeant Major who served over 27 years in the U.S. Army. He states \nApplicant is a man of great integrity, who is dedicated to his family and work. He has \nknown Applicant for two years and is impressed with his professional conduct. He \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n6\nbelieves Applicant can be trusted and should be allowed to maintain his cleared status. \nThe supervisor was aware of the February 2008 incident report when Applicant started \nto work for him two years ago. He claims Applicant was honest and wrote the necessary \nstatements required by the government agency. He underwent an SCI background \ninvestigation and a government agency suitability determination. He indicates Applicant \nprovides a positive influence and his truthfulness is an example for all to follow. (AE D, \nLetter of C.F., Sergeant Major, U.S. Army (RET), dated February 15, 2010)    \n \nApplicant provided additional character references. His references describe \nApplicant as \u201chard working,\u201d \u201cconscientious,\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d Most were informed of \nthe SOR allegations and were surprised. (AE D)  Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations \nwhile on active duty state that he meets or exceeds standards. His military awards and \ndecorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (2), Good Conduct \nMedal (2), National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Sea \nService Deployment Ribbon, Navy Pistol Shot Ribbon (Marksman); and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal. (AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are still required in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n7\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThe following personal conduct disqualifying conditions potentially apply to the \nfacts of this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities); \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative); \n \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n8\nAG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \nother government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources); and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. Applicant \nknowingly provided false information on his resume in order to enhance his employment \nqualifications. During his job interview with Company B, he was given the opportunity to \nclarify that he was not CISSP certified but said nothing. When he was asked to provide \nproof of his CISSP certification, he purchased a false CISSP certification from a \ncompany based on the Internet. Applicant went to great lengths to falsely indicate that \nhe was CISSP certified. He perpetuated the falsehood over the five-month period he \nwas employed with Company B.   \n \n \nSOR \u00b61.g is found for Applicant. This allegation does not raise a new pleading \nbut rather summarizes facts that are relevant to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and \n1.f. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies pertaining to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and 1.h.  \nBetween 2005 and August 2009, Applicant was involved in significant misconduct which \nraised issues of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nand willingness to comply with rules and regulations. In 2005, Applicant was punished \nunder Article 15 for failure to obey orders and assault. While more information about the \nunderlying offenses would have been helpful, it is clear that the Navy considered the \noffense was serious based on the subsequent involuntary discharge proceeding for \nmisconduct (serious offense). From September 2007 to February 2008, he falsely \nclaimed to be CISSP certified. He went to great lengths to perpetuate this falsehood.  \nSometime between May 2009 and August 24, 2009, Applicant inaccurately claimed that \nhe worked hours on his timesheets when he was out of the office. \n \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n9\n \nAlthough Applicant claims that he had permission to take paid time off from work \nat Company D when he was attending class, the management at Company D did not \ngive him permission to do so. While the project manager of the company who held the \nprimary contract wrote a letter stating Applicant let him know about his second job and \nabout his time off, he was not an official representative of Applicant\u2019s company and did \nnot have authority to grant approval. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies because of Applicant\u2019s conduct \nbetween 2005 and August 2009 reveals a pattern of dishonesty and rule violations. His \ninaccurate timekeeping when employed at Company D raised additional questions \nabout his integrity and is evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. In Applicant\u2019s situation, it was a significant misuse of his \nemployer\u2019s time and resources.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies because Applicant\u2019s past falsifications about his computer \ncertifications made him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Applicant \nwas aware that if Company B discovered that he was not CISSP certified he would be \nfired. As a result, he took the falsehood one step further by purchasing a false \ncertification over the Internet and presenting it to Company B. If Applicant were to be \ndiscovered, it would have affected his professional standing.  \n \n \nThe following personal conduct mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, of falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts); \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant had the opportunity to tell the program \nmanager during his interview with Company B that he did not have the CISSP \ncertification. He chose not to say anything because he thought he would eventually \nbecome certified. He had another opportunity to say he was not certified when he was \nasked to provide a copy of his CISSP certification. Instead, he chose to purchase a \nfalse CISSP certification and present that to Company B. Although Applicant left his \nemployment with Company B because he states he realized that he went too far, he \nnever told Company B about the false certification document. Company B later filed an \nincident report in JPAS in February 2008. (This fact is not disputed although the record \ndoes not contain a copy of the incident report.) Although Applicant apparently disclosed \nthe facts related to his falsely claiming that he was CISSP certified to his subsequent \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n10\nemployer, he did not disclose that he was not CISSP certified during the five months \nthat he worked for Company B. Thus, he did not make a prompt good-faith effort to \ncorrect his deliberate falsification.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because of the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct. He \nhas had a pattern of questionable behavior since 2005 when he received NJP for failure \nto obey an order and assault. An offense considered serious enough by the Navy to \ninvoluntarily discharge him for misconduct (serious offense). Two years later, he \ndeliberately holds himself out as being CISSP qualified in order to enhance his job \nqualifications. Once hired, he perpetuates the falsehood for five months until he is told \nto provide his certification.  He then obtains and presents a false CISSP certification \nrather than telling the truth. In May 2009, he is terminated for cause from Company D \nfor inaccurate time-keeping.  All of these offenses are serious. Applicant\u2019s behavior over \nthe past five years raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies because Applicant subsequently disclosed the conduct \nrelated to his falsification of a CISSP certification to subsequent employers which \nreduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.    \n \nOverall, Applicant was involved in three significant incidents over the past five \nyears that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. While he \nprovided some mitigating evidence, each of these incidents raised questions about \nApplicant\u2019s integrity. Applicant has not mitigated the concerns under personal conduct.   \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n        \n\n \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWhen unredacted this document contains information \nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under FOIA \nExemption 6 applies \n \n \n11\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant provided significant \nmitigating evidence, his history of questionable conduct over the past five years, the \nmost recent incident occurring in August 2009, outweigh the mitigating evidence and \nraise questions about his ability to handle classified information. The security concerns \nraised under Personal Conduct are not mitigated.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 33 years old, and has an Associates Degree in Occupational Studies, and an Airframe and Powerplant certificate. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Aircraft Mechanic and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits the allegations set forth under this guideline. The delinquent debts set forth in the SOR totaled in excess of $ 23,000.00. (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) Credit Reports of the Applicant dated July 9, 2008; June 17, 2009; October 3, 2009; February 25, 2010; and May 15, 2010, collectively reflected each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\u201d (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program\u201d (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on February 1, 2010, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on March 9, 2010.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 30, 2010,\nscheduling the hearing for May 19, 2010.  The Government presented eight exhibits,\nreferred to Government Exhibits 1 to 9, which were admitted without objection.  The\n\n2\nApplicant presented twenty exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through T,\nwhich were admitted without objection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf.  The\nrecord remained open until June 2, 2010, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to\nsubmit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted five Post-Hearing Exhibits,\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted\nwithout objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 3, 2010.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 33 years old, and has an Associates\nDegree in Occupational Studies, and an Airframe and Powerplant certificate.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as an Aircraft Mechanic and is seeking to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits the allegations set forth under this guideline.  The\ndelinquent debts set forth in the SOR totaled in excess of $ 23,000.00.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nAnswer to SOR.)  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated July 9, 2008; June 17, 2009;\nOctober 3, 2009; February 25, 2010; and May 15, 2010, collectively reflected each of\nthe delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 5, 6, 7 ,8 and 9.)  \nThe Applicant served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from\nMarch 1999 to June 2004.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2.)  He was married and\nhad a child in 2001.  In 2004, he was going through a separation and divorce from his\nwife.  It was at this time that his financial problems began.  As a result of his divorce, he\nwas required to pay child support.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 1.)  He was unable\nto find suitable work.  He got a part time job, but only earned minimum wage and could\nnot make ends meet.  When he was able to obtain full time jobs, he still did not earn\nenough to cover his bills.  During this time, he spend most of his money on child\nsupport, which he has consistently paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)  \nTo improve his financial situation, he decided to go to college.  He attended\ncollege from 2006 to 2008, obtained a degree, and took out student loans to accomplish\n\n3\nthis.  Most of the debt set forth in the SOR, except his student loans, were delinquent\ncredit cards that were acquired during his marriage that only increased after he left the\nmilitary.  He became aware of the extent of the debt when he started working for his\ncurrent employer in 2008.  Since then, he has paid off each of the debts, except his\nstudent loans.  His six student loans, totaling approximately $17,475.00 were in\ndeferment and are not delinquent.  The Applicant has been making the required monthly\npayments since April 2009.  He is currently in the process of consolidating his student\nloans and he plans on making the required monthly payment until the debt is paid in full.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H and I, and Post-Hearing Exhibits 3 and 4.)      \nThe Applicant was indebted to the following creditors: A debt to a creditor in the\namount of $872.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B and Tr. p. 55 - 56.)  A debt to\na creditor in the amount of $54.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E and Tr. p. 57.)\nA debt to a creditor in the amount of $361.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E and\nTr. p. 57.)  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $314.00 has been paid.  (Tr. p. 60.)  A\ndebt to a creditor in the amount of $3,492.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D, F\nand Tr. pp. 81-82.)  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $632.00 has been paid.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 3 and Tr. p. 85.)  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $278.00 has\nbeen paid.  (Tr. p. 86.)    \nThe Applicant started working for his current employer in April 2008.  He is now\nearning twice as much as he had previously.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  His personal\nfinancial statement that accurately reflects his current monthly budget indicates that\nafter paying his regular monthly expenses, he has approximately $791.00 left at the end\nof the month.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  He anticipates that his consolidated student loan\npayment will be approximately $234.00 monthly.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 3\nand 4.)  He has sufficient monies left at the end of the month to comfortably make the\nstudent loan payments.  He has a roommate and is sharing the living expenses.  He is\nalso able to save for retirement.    \nNumerous letters of recommendation were submitted on behalf of the Applicant.\nHis manager, supervisors, co-workers, professional associates and friends attest to his\nresponsible nature, good judgment, and positive attitude.  He is extremely\nknowledgeable and proficient as an aircraft technician.  He has received a special merit\npay increase of 13% after only eight months with the company, and has received three\nspecial recognition awards during his employment for his outstanding workmanship,\ndedication and positive attitude.  He is also described as a man of great integrity, and\nintelligence. He is considered to be a vital asset to the team and highly recommended\nfor a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S and T.)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the condition that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance;\n20(d)  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \n\n5\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n6\nThe Applicant\u2019s excessive indebtedness was caused by a divorce and periods of\nunemployment and/or under-employment beginning in 2004, when he left the military.\nHis difficulties in finding suitable employment prevented him from being able to pay his\nbills.  Since April 2008, he has been working for his current employer, has earned\nsubstantially more money, and has resolved all of his delinquent debts.  His student\nloans are in the process of being consolidated and he plans to continue making the\nrequired monthly payments to resolve them.  He is living frugally and responsibly.  He\nunderstands the importance of paying his bills on time and living within his means.  He\nis current with all of his monthly expenses, and demonstrates financial rehabilitation.\nHe has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility.\nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance and, 20(d) the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  The\nApplicant has indeed made a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve his debts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole-person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.       \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On October 15, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nSeptember 27, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\nDefense contractor.  He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree is business marketing.  He and his wife separated\nin 2010.  His wife\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage lives with Applicant.  The wife provides\nlimited financial support for her daughter.  \nApplicant worked for a law enforcement agency from 1989 until 2005, during which time\nhe held a security clearance.  He lost his job after his clearance was revoked.  The revocation was\nthe result of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, criminal conduct, and personal conduct issues.  The\ncriminal conduct included bad checks and reckless driving.  He also used a Government travel card\nto pay expenses for a family vacation and failed to reimburse the Government.  Applicant was\ndisciplined for having failed to report the criminal incidents to his Government employer.  He also\n\u201cdisclosed that he had issued another bad check in June 2010 . . . Applicant admitted to issuing the\nthree bad checks, but he claimed that he reviewed his bank account balance prior to issuing the\nchecks.\u201d  Decision at 3.  \nAdditionally, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1998.  He stated that\nhe had done so because he wanted to discharge his own personal debts in order to be better able to\nassist his wife in paying off her own debts that she had brought to the marriage.  He also had 19\ndelinquent debts, unpaid as of the close of the record.  These debts included judgments against\nApplicant in favor of the creditors.  In the Analysis, the Judge stated that Applicant accumulated\nthese debts after his discharge in bankruptcy.  Applicant attributed his financial problems to periods\nof unemployment.  \nIn 2008, Applicant completed his application for a public trust position.  He failed to disclose\na 1998 bad check and subsequent criminal charge.  He failed to disclose the judgement against him\nand denied having any debts that were more than 180 days delinquent.    \nIn analyzing Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, the Judge stated that the repeated nature of\nApplicant\u2019s Guideline E misconduct indicates that he is not learning from his mistakes and that the\nmisconduct is likely to recur.  Under Guideline F, he noted that Applicant\u2019s debts were ongoing and\nconcluded that Applicant had not acted responsibly in regard to them.  In the whole-person analysis\n\n3\nthe Judge credited Applicant for his evidence of good character.  However, the Judge stated that\nApplicant\u2019s circumstances show a disregard for his legal obligation to pay his debts.  The Judge\nultimately concluded that Applicant had not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns alleged in the\nSOR.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  For example, he claims that\nhis false answers to his trustworthiness application were not intentional and that the Judge erred in\nfinding that he had written three bad checks in 2010 rather than just one.  On this last point, we read\nthe challenged finding as referring to three instances over several years, which is consistent with the\nevidence, not three instances in 2010 as Applicant reads the finding .  The Judge\u2019s material findings\nof trustworthiness concern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable\ncharacterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 10-\n01100 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2011).  Applicant has submitted new evidence in support of his\nappeal, for example character references.  We cannot consider new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nSee ADP Case No. 08-09058 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2009).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

In light of the entirety of the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s decision not to grant Applicant\na trustworthiness designation is sustainable. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Since then, \nhe acquired 19 debts, totaling close to $40,000, that have been delinquent for many \nyears. He failed to establish a track record of financial responsibility in addressing his \nlegal obligations. Additionally, his unmitigated personal conduct security concern create \ndoubt about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and his ability to follow the law, \nrules, and regulations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on \nAugust 8, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with national security \nto grant Applicant eligibility to occupy a public trust position.  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nSeptember 27, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nOn October 15, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nindicating trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the adjudicative guidelines (AG).2  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 1, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2011, to \ndetermine whether Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position should be granted or \ndenied. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2011, convening a hearing on July \n13, 2011. At the hearing, the Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 13. Applicant \ntestified and presented exhibits (AE) 1 through 3. AE 3 was timely received post-\nhearing. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 20, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1b, 1.d through 1.h, 2.a \nthrough 2.c, 2.e through 2.i, 2.l, and 2.n through 2.t.3 He denied the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.d, 2.j, 2.k, and 2.m. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, his March 2009 statement, and his demeanor and testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended college \nfrom 1983 until 1988, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business marketing. He \nmarried his wife in June 1997, and they separated in June 2010. His wife has a 16-year-\nold daughter from a previous relationship who is currently living with Applicant. He did \nnot adopt his stepdaughter. Applicant\u2019s disabled mother also lives with him. He provides \nfinancial support for his step-daughter and his mother. His wife provides limited financial \nsupport for her daughter. \n \nApplicant worked for a Government law enforcement agency from June 1989 \nuntil August 2005. He possessed a security clearance at the secret level during the 17 \nyears he worked for that agency. He was terminated from his employment after his \nsecurity clearance was revoked as a result of criminal misconduct, personal conduct, \nand financial problems. (GE 9) In November 1997, Applicant issued a bad check for \nover $200. In March 1998, he was arrested and charged with issuing a bad check with \nthe intent to defraud, a Class 6 felony. (GE 3) Because he worked for a law \nenforcement agency, Applicant was required to notify his employer of his arrest, \n \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and DoD \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation). \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the AGs implemented by the DOD on September 1, \n2006. \n \n3 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted in part, and denied in part, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nHowever, during his hearing he admitted the factual allegations in both paragraphs.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncharges, and financial problems. He failed to do so, and he was issued a letter of \nreprimand. (GE 4)  \n \nIn April 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with reckless driving for \ndriving 36 miles over the speed limit. He was convicted and sentenced to 60 days in jail \n(56 days suspended), to pay a fine, and to 12 months probation. His driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for six months. (GE 5) He retained an attorney to represent him in the \nreckless driving trial. He issued a bad check to pay for his legal fees. In February 2002, \nApplicant was charged with issuing a bad check for over $200. He pled guilty to a \nmisdemeanor charge. He was sentenced to pay a fine, to perform community service, \nand to serve 12 months supervised probation. In October 2002, Applicant received a \nletter of reprimand and was suspended from work for three days for recklessly driving a \nGovernment car, and for his failure to timely report an accident involving a Government \ncar. (GE 7) \n \nIn 2002, Applicant went on a family vacation and used his Government credit \ncard to pay for his personal rental car expenses. He then failed to timely reimburse the \nGovernment. He was reprimanded and suspended for one day from his employment \nbecause of his misuse of a Government credit card, and for his failure to fulfill his \nfinancial obligations. (GE 8) As a result of Applicant\u2019s personal conduct and financial \nproblems, his security clearance was revoked in August 2005. Shortly thereafter, he \nwas terminated from his employment. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant disclosed that he issued another bad check in June \n2010. He was arrested in August-September 2010, and charged with issuing a bad \ncheck with the intent to defraud. (Tr. 48) Applicant admitted to issuing the three bad \nchecks, but he claimed that he reviewed his bank account balance prior to issuing the \nchecks. In all three occasions, his wife withdrew money from his checking account \nwithout his knowledge and that caused the checks to bounce. He also claimed that his \nimproper use of the Government credit card was an honest mistake. He was in a hurry \nand used the wrong credit card. \n \nAfter his termination, Applicant was unable to find a steady, full-time job for three \nyears. He was unemployed and underemployed until August 2008, when he was hired \nby his current employer, a Government contractor. He provided financial support for his \nfamily by working part-time jobs and accepting unemployment benefits. \n \nConcerning his financial problems, Applicant explained that his 1998 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filing was the result of his wife bringing numerous personal debts into the \nmarriage. He claimed that he sought the discharge of his individually accumulated debts \nbecause he wanted to be in a better financial posture to assist his wife to pay the debts \nshe brought into the marriage. (GE 10) \n \nApplicant submitted his application for a public trust position in August 2008. In \nhis application, he disclosed that he issued a bad check in 2002. He failed to disclose \nthe bad check he issued in March 1998, and the subsequent criminal charge filed \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nagainst him. He disclosed no legal judgments filed against him. He also indicated that \nhe had no loans or financial obligations over 180 days delinquent. \n \nThe subsequent background investigation disclosed the 19 delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR, totaling close to $40,000. In March 2009, Applicant was questioned \nby a Government investigator concerning his personal conduct, delinquent debts, and \ncurrent financial problems. During the interview, Applicant claimed he was not aware of \nthe judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c (filed in October 2007), and 2.d (filed in October \n2006). Additionally, he claimed not to recognize the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.g, 2.h, 2.l, 2.q, and 2.s. He admitted that he was aware of the delinquent debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i,4 2.m (delinquent since July 2004), 2.o (delinquent since April 2006), 2.p \n(delinquent since April 2007), and 2.q (delinquent since November 2004). The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.o and 2.p were the result of personal loans taken by Applicant in \n2003-2004, to pay other delinquent debts. (Tr. 43) \n \nApplicant admitted during his 2009 interview that he had not taken any steps to \npay, settle, dispute, or resolve any of his delinquent debts. He claimed that he was \nemploying the services of a debt consolidation company to help him pay his debts. He \nattributed his financial problems to being unemployed for two years. He indicated that \nhis family combined monthly income was $4,200 (Applicant\u2019s income was $2,200 and \nhis wife\u2019s income was $2,000). His total monthly expenses were $4,135, with a net \nmonthly remainder of $65. \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that all the debts alleged in the SOR \nare Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, most of which have been delinquent for many years. \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that his current financial problems were the result of \nhis and his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment, his 2010 separation \nfrom his wife, and him being the sole financial support for his mother and stepdaughter. \nHe explained that most of his debts were acquired by him and his wife when he was \nmaking $70,000 a year and she was also working. Since August 2008, he has been \nmaking only around $40,000 a year, and his wife contributes very little to her daughter\u2019s \nsupport.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant claimed he considered employing the services of a debt \nconsolidation company to help him resolve his debts. He decided against it because he \ncurrently does not have the financial resources to do so. Applicant has not paid or \nresolved even his small delinquent debts (less than $300). He testified he only has \nsufficient income to pay for his day-to-day living expenses and necessities, but not to \npay for his delinquent debts. He averred that he was working with a mortgage lender to \nrepair his credit. He plans to take a second job sometime in the future to expedite the \npayment of his debts.  \n \n4 Applicant claimed he paid this debt. However, he failed to present documentary evidence to \nsupport his claim. The debt is reported as delinquent in both the February and July 2010 credit reports, \nGE 11 and 12, respectively. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant further claimed that in December 2010, he sent letters to his creditors \nto ascertain the validity of the debts, to dispute some debts, to inform creditors of his \nfinancial problems, and to request reduced payment schedules and a reduction of the \ndebt owed. Applicant presented no documentary evidence of any payments made, \ncontacts with creditors, disputed debts, or of any other actions taken to otherwise \nresolve his delinquent financial obligations since he acquired them.  \n \nApplicant repeatedly stated that he is an honest and forthright person. He \nconsiders himself to be a hard-working, Christian family man. Applicant expressed \nremorse for his financial problems. He believes that his financial problems are due to \ncircumstances beyond his control, and that he is currently doing all that he can to \naddress his delinquent obligations. He noted he worked for another Government agency \nfor 17 years, and that he held a security clearance at the secret level without any \nsecurity violations.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s controlling adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to \nthe Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a trustworthiness concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant issued bad checks in March 1998, February 2002, and August 2010. \nHe was arrested and charged with issuing bad checks with the intent to defraud. In \n1998, he was reprimanded for his failure to notify his employer that he was arrested and \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncharged with a criminal offense. He was convicted in April 2001, for reckless driving. In \nOctober 2002, he was suspended for three days from his job because of his reckless \ndriving charges, and for  his failure to timely notify his employer that he was involved in \nan accident with a Government vehicle. In 2003, he misused a Government credit card \nand failed to pay the charges on time.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s overall behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying condition AG \n\u00b6 16:  \n \n(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and  \n \n(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \nAfter considering all the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions, I find none apply. \nApplicant\u2019s frequent questionable behavior established a pattern of misconduct. His \nrepeated offenses show that he is not learning from his mistakes, and that his \nquestionable behavior is likely to recur. Considering his age, education, and job \nexperience holding a security clearance, his misconduct cannot be considered minor, \nand it is not mitigated by the passage of time. His overall behavior shows questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the trustworthiness concern is that failure or inability to live \nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 and was discharged of his \nfinancial obligations. His financial problems have continued through the years as \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndemonstrated by him issuing bad checks and abusing the Government credit card. He \naccumulated 19 delinquent debts, totaling nearly $40,000. His financial problems \nworsened after he was terminated from his employment because of his personal \nmisconduct. Later, he was unable to pay his debts because of his periods of \nunemployment, underemployment, and his separation from his wife. AG \u00b6 19(a): \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing. His periods of unemployment and underemployment were the \nresult of his job termination because of his personal and criminal misconduct. Thus, his \nunemployment and underemployment were not the result of circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. As such, they do not mitigate his financial considerations concerns. \n \n \nMoreover, Applicant failed to establish that he acted responsibly under the totality \nof his circumstances. He filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998, and he did not learn \nfrom that experience. He has continued to accumulate significant delinquent debt, most \nof which remains unresolved. He presented little or no evidence of contact with \ncreditors, settlements, payments, or of efforts to otherwise resolve his delinquent \nfinancial obligations since he acquired them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nDuring his 17 years working for a law enforcement agency and holding a security \nclearance, Applicant was made aware of the Government\u2019s financial considerations \nsecurity concerns through his submissions of security clearance applications and when \nhe was disciplined for issuing bad checks. He was made aware of those concerns again \nduring his 2009 interview and through the October 2010 SOR. Notwithstanding, he took \nlittle action to resolve even his small debts. Applicant should have been more diligent in \nhis efforts to resolve his delinquent financial obligations. On balance, and considering \nthe evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has not received counseling, his financial \nproblem is ongoing, and there are no clear indications that his financial problems are \nunder control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(f) is not raised by the evidence in \nthis case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated in my whole-person analysis my comments \non the analysis of Guidelines F and E. \nApplicant receives credit for being a good son and a good father. \nNotwithstanding, public trust concerns remain. Applicant acquired financial obligations \nbeyond his financial means and then showed disregard for his legal obligation to pay his \ndebts. He failed to establish a track record of financial responsibility. The record \nevidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns \narising from his financial considerations and personal conduct.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.e,   \n \n \n \n \n \n   2.g \u2013 2.j, and 2.l \u2013 2.t: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.f and 2.k: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant5 \n \n \n5 These two debts were paid by Applicant\u2019s wife. (AE 3) \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy a public trust position. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a public trust position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 20, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\n\n2\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 29, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran granted Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndesignation.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the pertinent mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nwas erroneous.  Consistent with the following discussion, we reverse the decision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact.  Applicant is an engineer employed\nby a Defense contractor.  Born in Iran, Applicant married her Iranian-born husband and immigrated\nto the U.S. in the early 1990s.  Her husband was a U.S. citizen at the time of the marriage.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran, as are her four siblings.  Her mother-in-law\nand a sibling-in-law are citizens and residents of Iran as well.  None of Applicant\u2019s or her husband\u2019s\nimmediate family members work for the Iranian government.  Applicant retained her Iranian\npassport after she became a U.S. citizen.  She traveled to Iran on this passport twice after becoming\na U.S. citizen, although she has since destroyed it.  \nIran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic relations since 1980.  Iran is attempting to develop\nweapons of mass destruction.  Additionally, it is the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism,\nsupports violent opposition to the Mid-East peace process, and has a poor human rights record.  It\nhas provided \u201clethal support for groups that are directly responsible for hundreds of U.S. casualties.\u201d\nDecision at 3.  The government of Iran has committed numerous serious abuses of human rights,\nincluding political killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of due\nprocess, and severe restrictions on civil liberties.  Iran does not recognize dual citizenship.\nAccordingly, it considers those born in Iran to be Iranian citizens.  The Judge\u2019s findings are not\nchallenged on appeal.  \nDiscussion\nWe may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a trustworthiness designation\nif it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the\ngovernment presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. In deciding whether the\nJudge's rulings or conclusions are in error, we will review the Judge's decision to determine whether:\nit does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its\nconclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does\nnot consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important\naspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence;\n\n1Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(a): \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\nperson are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d\n \n3\nor it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  See ADP Case No.\n06-12901 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2007).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision extended too much weight to evidence\nthat none of Applicant\u2019s family members worked for the Iranian government.  She argues that the\nJudge did not consider the extent to which Iran could influence Applicant\u2019s family regardless of any\ngovernment connections.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.\nIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, the intelligence\ngathering history of that government, and the presence of terrorist activity are important\nconsiderations that provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-14978 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 11.\n2007); ADP Case No. 06-24818 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2007).  The country\u2019s human rights record\nis also an important consideration.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006).  There is a rational connection\nbetween an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are adverse to the United States and\nthe risk that the applicant might fail to protect and safeguard information entrusted to him or her by\nvirtue of occupying a public trust position.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16,\n2002); ADP Case 06-24818, supra.  Moreover, in-laws represent a class of persons who are\ncontemplated by the Directive as presenting a potential risk.  As a matter of common sense and\nhuman experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or\nobligation to, the immediate family members of the persons\u2019 spouse.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-\n26176 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2005). \nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives, to include her in-laws, her use of an Iranian\npassport to travel to Iran after having acquired U.S. citizenship, and Iran\u2019s status as a nation whose\ninterests are adverse to those of the U.S. cumulatively established Guideline B trustworthiness\nconcerns.  However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion under Mitigating Condition 8(a)1 that Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives have no incentive to bring Applicant to the attention of the authorities fails to address an\nimportant concern under Guideline B.  That concern is expressed in ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 8\n(App. Bd. Jul 28, 2005), in which the Appeal Board observed:\nThere is no good reason to assume that a foreign country with an authoritarian\ngovernment that has been . . . involved in state-sponsored terrorism would have\ncompunctions about exerting influence or pressure on its citizens just because they\nlack prominence or live modest, ordinary lives.\n\n2Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(b): \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person . . . is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S. that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\n \n4\n Moreover, an applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 obscurity does not provide a meaningful measure of whether\nan applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a risk, when, for example, the relatives are subject to the authority\nof a regime that is hostile to the U.S. and has a dismal human rights record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007).\nThe Judge\u2019s discussion does not adequately explain his apparent conclusion that Applicant would\nnot likely be placed in a position of choice between the interests of her Iranian relatives and the\ninterests of the U.S., which is crucial to Mitigating Condition 8(a).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis fails to consider an important aspect of the case.  ADP Case No. 06-12901, supra.\nSimilarly, the record will not support the Judge\u2019s favorable application of Mitigating\nCondition 8(b).2  The Judge\u2019s treatment of this mitigating condition is rather cursory.  He states that\nApplicant has such longstanding loyalties within the U.S. that she could be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S.  However, for similar reasons to those outlined above, he\ndoes not explain how the evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant would necessarily resolve\nconflicts of interest against the interests of her own close family in Iran.  The Judge\u2019s favorable\napplication of Mitigating Condition 8(b) is erroneous.  Furthermore, Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis merely repeats his conclusion under the\nmitigating conditions and does not provide an independent basis for his favorable decision.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the briefs of the parties, we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider an important aspect of the case and that it runs contrary\nto the weigh of the record evidence.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable\non this record.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable trustworthiness determination is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJanuary 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 15, 2010, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on May 18, 2010, and reassigned to me on June 18, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on July 13, 2010, and the hearing was convened as \nSeptember 29, 2010\n\n2 \nscheduled on August 12, 2010. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nAugust 20, 2010.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nApplicant affirmatively waived her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days \nnotice before the hearing.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Iran. Applicant did not object to the request, and it was approved. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are \nset out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without \nobjection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. She has \nworked for her current employer as a subcontractor since 2007 and directly since 2008. \nApplicant was born in Iran. She is seeking eligibility for a public trust position for the first \ntime. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree. She is married, and she has two children, ages 16 \nand 14.1   \n \n \nApplicant and her husband married in Iran in the early 1990s. Applicant \nimmigrated to the United States the following year. She became a U.S. citizen in 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s husband was born in Iran and came to the United States when he was in his \nearly teens. He was a U.S. citizen when they married. Because of Iranian law, he was \nalso a citizen of Iran.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran. Her father is a retired \nteacher. Her mother does not work outside the home. Applicant has four siblings who \nare citizens and residents of Iran.

Her sister-in-law works for a U.S. corporation doing \nbusiness in Iran. None of Applicant\u2019s or her husband\u2019s immediate family members work \nfor the Iranian government.3 \n \n \nApplicant retained her Iranian passport after she became a U.S. citizen. As \ndiscussed below, Iran continued to consider her an Iranian citizen after she became a \nU.S. citizen, and it does not recognize her U.S. citizenship. Applicant and her children \nvisited her family in Iran in 2004. She wanted to introduce her children to her family. She \nvisited her family in Iran again in 2008. Her children did not accompany her on this trip. \nShe used her Iranian passport on both trips. Applicant destroyed her Iranian passport in \nMarch 2009. She realizes that she cannot visit Iran without an Iranian passport. She is \nresigned to the fact that she cannot visit Iran while she is holding a public trust position. \nApplicant\u2019s husband has not been back to Iran since their wedding in the early 1990s.4  \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. She and her husband own a house in \nthe United States. She credibly testified that her loyalty and allegiance are to the United \nStates.5  \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The United States has not had \ndiplomatic relations with Iran since 1980. In 2008, President Bush stated that \u201c[t]he \nactions and policies of the Government of Iran are contrary to the interests of the United \nStates in the region and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\u201d The United States \nhas defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the world\u2019s leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. Iran has \nsought to make the United States suffer political, economic, and human costs. Further, \nIran has engaged in efforts to sow violence and undermine stability in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including lethal support for groups that are directly responsible for \nhundreds of U.S. casualties. \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 46, 52-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 47-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n5 Tr. at 61-63, 66. \n\n4 \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n5 \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n6 \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are citizens and residents of Iran, a country that \nis clearly hostile to the United States.6 Her husband is a U.S.-Iranian dual citizen. His \nmother and sister are citizens and residents of Iran. Applicant traveled to Iran in 2004 \nand 2008. Iran is considered the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the \ngovernment of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against its \npeople. Applicant\u2019s family members\u2019 presence in Iran creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, both through her \nand through her husband. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), \nand 7(d) have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for more than 15 years and has been a U.S. \ncitizen since 2003. Her husband is a U.S. citizen, and Iran also recognizes him as an \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). \n\n7 \nIranian citizen. They have two children who were born in the United States. Applicant \nand her husband own a house in the United States. She has no foreign assets. She has \ndestroyed her Iranian passport, and she is resigned to the fact that she cannot visit Iran \nwhile she is holding a public trust position. Her life, career, assets, interests, and \nallegiance all lie in the United States. Her family members in Iran, including in-laws, \nhave no connection to the Iranian government and no incentive to bring Applicant to the \nattention of the Iranian government. It is therefore, unlikely Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the Iranian government, a terrorist \norganization, or her family members in Iran and the interests of the United States. I \nfurther find there is no conflict of interest, because Applicant has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in America, that she can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \n\u00b6 8(b) is applicable. No other mitigating condition is applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born in Iran. She married her husband in Iran in the early 1990s \nand immigrated to the United States the following year. Her husband is a U.S. citizen. \nShe has two children who were born and raised in the United States as U.S. citizens. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 2003. She traveled to Iran on an Iranian passport in \n2004 and 2008 to visit relatives. The use of his Iranian passport was not because \nApplicant maintained a sense of loyalty or allegiance to Iran; it was the only viable \noption for Applicant to travel to Iran, and was consistent with the information provided by \nthe State Department, as stated in the Hearing Exhibits. She destroyed the passport \nand does not intend to return to Iran while holing a position of public trust.  \n\n8 \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in \nassessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. Iran is the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has a dismal human \nrights record. Applicant\u2019s family members have no connection to the Iranian government \nand have no reason to raise Applicant\u2019s profile with the Iranian government. These facts \nminimize any potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant was \nsincere, open, and honest at the hearing. In the unlikely event that her family members \nwere subjected to coercion or duress from the Iranian government or terrorist groups, I \nfind that because of her deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, including her uncompromising commitment to her country and her children, that \nApplicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress \nin favor of the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence trustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 10, 2009, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on September 15, 2009. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant and it was received on September 21, 2009.

Applicant did not object to the FORM and submitted additional material that \nwas considered.1 The case was assigned to me on December 3, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee for a defense contractor. She has an \nAssociate in Science degree she received in May 2000. She is married and has a \nstepchild and two biological children.  \n \n \nApplicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire (DD 398-2) on January \n27, 1993. She was required to divulge if she had ever tried or used or possessed any \nnarcotic, to include marijuana, even if it was a one time experimental use. Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the question.  \n \n \nApplicant completed a Personal Security Questionnaire (DD 398) on March 13, \n1995. She was required to divulge if she ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic, \nto include marijuana, even if it was a one time experimental use. Applicant answered \n\u201cno\u201d to the question. \n \n \nApplicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on April 30, 2001. \nShe was required to divulge any illegal drug use since the age of 16 or in the last seven \nyears, whichever was shorter. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question. \n \n \nOn December 16, 2004, as part of a background investigation for a federal \nagency, Applicant took a polygraph examination. Applicant disclosed during a post-\npolygraph interview the following information:  \n \n \nBetween the ages of 17 and 19 I associated with a group of friends who \nused and had marijuana frequently. On weekends I smoked marijuana \nwith them. My best recollection is the total number of times was at least 50 \nbut less than 100. Between the age of approximately 20 and the present I \nsmoked marijuana five times, the most recent being at a Christmas party \none year ago. I\u2019ve read the above and it is accurate.2 \n \nApplicant signed the statement.  \n \n \n1 Letter from Morrow, Poppe, Watermeier & Lonowski dated October 14, 2009. \n \n2 Item 7 at 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nOn January 11, 2005, Applicant sent a letter to the federal agency requesting a \nsecond polygraph.3 She stated the following: \n \nOn my behalf, I was extremely nervous during the polygraph exam and felt \nas if I was a criminal being interrogated not an applicant for employment. \nThis was the first polygraph I\u2019ve ever taken and I didn\u2019t know what to \nexpect. After the exam was over I was told by the polygrapher that I had \nfailed the drug portion of the exam. I told him I didn\u2019t understand how that \ncould be; I answered the questions as honestly as I could. He then \nproceeded to question me and informed me (the) [that] he though[t] I knew \nI was gong to lie before I even came into the office. I couldn\u2019t think \nstraight, my mind was racing trying to recall when and where I had done \ndrugs in the past. At one point I felt he became irritated because I wasn\u2019t \ngiving him the answers he wanted. At that point I just wanted out of the \nroom and away from the situation. He began to create a time-line of my \nlife starting from the age of 17, and from there he gathered that I must \nhave done drugs quit[e] often because the people I was around did. He \ninformed me that if I wanted to pass the next polygraph exam I needed to \nfind a safe number of times I used drugs, a number I could pass with. I \ntold him I didn\u2019t know, I thought I was safe with less tha[n] 15 times, \nbut obviously I wasn\u2019t. (emphasis added) I was so confused and wasn\u2019t \nreally listening to him; I was still trying to remember when and where. I \ntold him that I had tried marijuana at a party about three years ago, \ngive or take a few months.(emphasis added) I asked if that could be \n[the] cause for me to fail. He told me that wasn\u2019t what I was hav[ing] a \nproblem with. He said judging by my exam I was having problems with the \namount of usage. He then wrote out a letter and stated that it contained \nthe information we just talked about and asked me to read and sign it. I \ntried to read it but couldn\u2019t focus on what it said. I wrote that it was \naccurate. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I felt intimidated and just wanted \nout of the room. I signed it and he let me leave. Not even 5 minutes later I \ncame back into the room and asked to talk with him. He shut the door and \nI told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the letter I signed, I stated that I \ncouldn\u2019t remember every detail from my past but that I know I have \nused drugs more than 15 times. (emphasis added) He then told me it \nwas too late! I had already signed it and he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I \nleft the office and while driving home, an hour later, I called him and stated \nthat I had been driving for awhile and was thinking about what I was doing \nat the age of 17. At that time in my life I was doing volunteer work through \nthe explorer post program with the Sher[r]riff\u2019s office and I know for a fact I \nwasn\u2019t using drugs. He again stated that it didn\u2019t matter now; I had already \nsigned the letter. However, he would make a note of our conversation on \nthe application.4 (Emphasis added) \n \n3 Item 7 at 7. \n \n4 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nOn December 19, 2006, Applicant certified a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions. She was required to reply to a question about her past illegal use of drugs \nsince the age of 16 or in the past seven years whichever was shorter. She responded \n\u201cno\u201d to the question. \n \n \nDuring an April 23, 2008, interview with an authorized investigator, Applicant \ndenied she ever used any controlled substance, to include marijuana on any occasion \nand that any information reported from her previous background investigation pertaining \nto her using marijuana was completely false. She did not disclose that she used \nmarijuana between 50 and 100 times between 1988 and 1999 and five times between \n1997 and 2003. \n \n \nAs part of Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she provided a previous written \nstatement that was undated. In the statement she adamantly denies ever using illegal \ndrugs. She believed the polygrapher mislead her and she signed the admission \nstatement of December 16, 2004, under duress after being \u201cinterrogated\u201d by the \npolygrapher. She explained that all she wanted to do was get out of the interview room \nand away from the polygrapher. She could not remember exactly what was said to \nmake her give him a number of 15 usages, but she thought she was trying to remember \nevery time she was in a room when someone was using drugs and so she gave him \nthat number.5 Applicant did not provide any amplifying information, facts, or \ncircumstances as how she was under duress. She repeated the same denial in the \nadditional material she provided in response to the FORM.  \n \n \nApplicant was a government contractor at the time of her post-polygraph \ninterview. It was conducted at the office location where she worked and continued to \nwork for approximately another year and a half. She did not identify any possible \nincentive for the polygrapher to coerce false information from her or to summarize it \nfalsely in the statement she signed. Applicant did not provide any evidence to support \nher contention that the statements she made to the polygrapher regarding her past \nmarijuana use were false and obtained through intimidation.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence to reconcile her repeated denials of drug \nuse on government documents, with the letter she voluntarily wrote and submitted to the \nfederal agency after her polygraph. The letter was sent approximately three and half \nweeks after her polygraph and post polygraph interview. In the letter she admitted she \nused marijuana three years ago and thought she was safe with listing she used \nmarijuana 15 times, but because she could not remember every detail from her past she \nknew she used it more than 15 times.  \n \n \nI find Applicant intentionally, deliberately, and repeatedly falsified information \nabout her prior drug use during an interview conducted by an authorized investigator on \nApril 23, 2008; on a Questionnaire for National Security Position certified on December \n19, 2006; on an SCA executed on April 30, 2001; on a Personnel Security \n \n5 Answer to SOR. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nQuestionnaire executed on March 13, 1995; and on a National Agency Questionnaire \nexecuted on January 27, 1993. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally, deliberately, and repeatedly falsified information about her \nprior illegal drug use on personnel security questionnaires, during an interview with an \nofficial government investigator, and for employment qualifications. I find the above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, an such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nApplicant has repeatedly failed to be truthful about her illegal drug use on \nsecurity clearance applications, during official interviews, and on questionnaires for \nnational security positions. She believes she signed a statement admitting illegal drug \nuse under duress. There is insufficient evidence to conclude she signed the statement \nunder duress. However, even if Applicant were to be believed, she subsequently \nprovided a written statement, that was unsolicited and voluntarily submitted, almost a \nmonth after her post-polygraph interview, whereby she admits past illegal drug use. \nSubsequent to this letter, on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions certified on \nDecember 19, 2006, Applicant denied her illegal drug use. She again denied ever using \nany illegal drugs during an interview with an authorized investigator on April 23, 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials of ever using any illegal drugs are not credible. Her written \nstatements are unbelievable. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has repeatedly lied on \npersonnel security questionnaires, during official interviews, and on other government \napplications. She believes she was under duress when she admitted illegal drug usage \nand denied she has ever used illegal drugs. However, she provided a written statement \nin 2005 to the federal agency conducting her background investigation and admitted \nusing illegal drugs. Applicant is not credible and has a history of being untruthful. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline \nfor Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIn an undated answer Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The answer was received by DOHA on June 24, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 23, 2009. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence. Applicant objected to GE 5 \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nand her objection was overruled. She did not object to any other exhibits and they were \nadmitted. The government also offered a demonstrative exhibit that was marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through E. Department \nCounsel did not object and they were admitted. Applicant and four witnesses testified on \nher behalf. The record was held open until October 7, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documents. She submitted AE F through I. Department Counsel did not \nobject and they were admitted.1 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nOctober 1, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.k and \n1.o. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has been employed as a business development \nspecialist for a federal contractor since March 2008. Prior to then, she was employed by \ndifferent federal contractors. She had a period of unemployment from November 2004 \nto March 2005, and a three-week period between 2007 and 2008. Applicant has moved \nseveral times due to her employment.  \n \nApplicant married in April 2003, and had a child in April 2004. Applicant served in \nthe Navy from February 1997 to December 2004. She and her husband agreed that she \nwould leave the Navy so she could be a full-time wife and mother. She was honorably \ndischarged on the basis of parenthood. Three weeks after she was discharged from the \nNavy, her husband filed for divorce. At that point she had no job and was caring for her \ninfant daughter. She made arrangements to move back to her home town where she \nhad family support. Days before the move was scheduled to take place, she received a \njob offer. The job was in a state with a high cost of living. She accepted the job and in \nJanuary 2005, she moved. She had no money or place to stay. She also did not have \nmoney to hire a lawyer for her divorce, which was acrimonious. The divorce was final in \nApril 2005. She started her life over. Her former husband provides $200 a month for \nchild support.2  \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant remarried. Her husband was in the Navy and she \naccepted a transfer from her job, so she could be closer to his duty station. She \nrelocated to a high cost of living area. He had legal problems in the Navy. She could not \nafford the rent and transferred back to the location where she previously worked. In July \n2006, she decided to file for an annulment from her husband. He was depleting the \nfunds in their joint accounts. He was gambling at the time. He was admitted to a mental \nhospital due to his behavior. Applicant had difficulty paying her expenses. Applicant is \nstill married to her second husband. She attempted to contact him over the past three \n \n1 HE II. \n \n2 Tr. 27-33, 56-59. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nyears and was unable to find him. In the past month her husband has contacted her.  \nThey are pursuing a divorce and are looking for the most cost effective means.3  \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant required major surgery and was out of work until \nDecember 2006, with no pay.4  \n \nIn 2007, Applicant had an opportunity to deploy to Afghanistan, which would \nhave given her an opportunity to earn a significantly higher salary. Her daughter\u2019s father \nwas caring for their daughter. The deployment fell through and he filed for full custody of \ntheir daughter in March 2008. This required Applicant to hire an attorney. There were \njurisdictional issues and the court required mediation, which was unsuccessful. \nApplicant estimated she spent approximately $20,000 on attorney\u2019s fees and travel \nexpenses to the out-of-state court. She believed her ex-husband intentionally dragged \nout the proceedings. The custody issue was resolved in July 2009.5  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.a ($110) was a joint account with her husband for phone \nservices. The bill has been delinquent since 2006, and is not paid.6  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.b ($260) is a medical debt related to Applicant\u2019s surgery in \n2006. She stated she did not receive a bill and has not contacted the creditor to resolve \nthe debt.7  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.c ($95) is owed to a beauty salon. Applicant incurred it while \nliving in a different state. She was unaware of the debt until she received the SOR. The \ndebt is from 2003. Applicant has not contacted the creditor or paid the debt.8 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.d ($212) is owed to an electric company. Applicant stated that \nat the time the bill became due she did not have the money to pay it. She has not \ncontacted the creditor or paid the debt.9 \n \nApplicant had a company credit card that was authorized for business expenses, \nfor which she was reimbursed. The debt in SOR 1.e ($3,465) is owed to the corporate \ncredit card.

She admitted that she was delinquent with \npayments before she married her second husband. She also admitted that because she \nwas experiencing financial problems she used the credit card for personal expenses. \nThe debt is unpaid.11  \n \nApplicant is not familiar with the debt in SOR 1.f ($697) and has not contacted \nthe creditor or credit bureau to dispute the debt or resolve it.12  \n \nApplicant had a second corporate credit card that is listed in SOR 1.g ($10,977) \nand became delinquent in February 2006. She admitted that she made some personal \npurchases with the card. She was reimbursed for her business expenses, but did not \npay the balance on the card, because her husband depleted their account. She became \ndelinquent on the account in February 2006. She stated she contacted the creditor \napproximately a year ago and they were unwilling to accept a payment arrangement. \nShe has not made any payments on the debt since it became delinquent in 2006.13  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.h ($993) is a loan that Applicant originally paid automatically \nwhile she was in the Navy. When she was discharged the automatic withdrawal ceased. \nShe did not make payments on the debt after she was discharged. She settled the debt \nin March 2009. The approximate amount of the settlement was $563.14 \n \nApplicant is not familiar with the debt in SOR 1.i ($94). She did not contact the \ncreditor to determine the debts validity or to resolve it. She did not contact the credit \nbureau agency to dispute the debt.15  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.j ($223) is a medical debt that was placed for collection in \nJanuary 2007. It is not resolved.16 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.k ($809) is owed to a cable company. Applicant thinks the \namount is a mistake. She believes, based on a notice she received three days before \nthe hearing, that the amount should be $84.

She stated her husband was responsible for the problem. She stopped \nusing the account sometime before 2007. She stated she made arrangements to settle \nthe account by paying $40 a month. She began making the payments in February or \nMarch 2009, and the current balance is $423.59.18 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.m ($65) is a charge for a nonsufficient funds check that was \npresented to a pizza delivery service. It has been delinquent since February 2008, and \nis not paid.19  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.n ($470) is owed to a telephone company telephone services. \nApplicant has not contacted the creditor or paid the debt.20  \n \nIn 2003, while stationed in a city where gambling is legal, Applicant won \napproximately $2,500 while gambling. She then lost her winnings and spent about \n$200-300 from her savings account. There is no evidence that Applicant is addicted to \ngambling or has a problem. However, in the past year she has taken her grandmother \nto a city to gamble approximately four times. While there she spends $100 to $200 to \ngamble. In 2007, she took two or three trips.21 Applicant attended marital counseling in \n2003, during which her gambling was brought up.22  \n \nApplicant paid a delinquent debt that was not listed on the SOR.23 Her monthly \nnet pay after taxes is approximately $4,000. Her annual gross salary is approximately \n$75,000. She estimated her monthly expenses were approximately $3,800. She still \nowes her attorney more than $5,600, and makes monthly payments of $500.24 After she \ncompletes paying her attorney, she intends to resolve her other delinquent debts. She \nexplained that because her husband withdrew money from her account and she \nincurred large legal fees during the child custody battle, she has been unable to pay \nother delinquent debts.25  \n \n \n \n18 Tr. 50-52, 82-84; AE I. \n \n19 Tr. 84-86. \n \n20 Tr. 86-87. \n \n21 Tr. 86-90. \n \n22 Tr. 86-88. \n \n23 AE B. \n \n24 AE A. \n \n25 Tr. 90-100, 131. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nAppellant purchased a new 2009 car in 2008 because it was too costly to repair \nher old one. She pays $361 a month for car payments and another $218 a month for \ninsurance.26  \n \nApplicant\u2019s plan is to complete paying the money she owes to her attorney and \nthen start paying off the smaller debts and consolidating the larger debts.27 \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents testified on her behalf and confirm she made some poor \nchoices in her life, but attributed them to her age and immaturity. Over the past three \nyears, they have observed her mature, especially in her decision-making. Their niece, \nwho is a small business owner, is helping Applicant establish a budget and is providing \nsome financial counseling. Applicant recently purchased a car, but did not want her \nparents to co-sign the loan. She wanted to do things on her own. Applicant\u2019s father \nloaned her money and she began repaying it. She still owes him $800, but he has \nagreed to have the repayment put on hold. They believe she is a good person and a \ngood mother. She has made mistakes, but they believe she has a desire to change \nthings.28  \n \nApplicant\u2019s coworker and friend testified on her behalf. He has known her for 13 \nyears. She is considered loyal and faithful to the company they work for and a good \nperson.29 \n \nThe owner of the company where Applicant works testified on her behalf. He has \nknown Applicant casually for 14 years through his son, but lost contact with her when \nshe went into the Navy. He hired her based on her military record. She has worked \ndirectly for the owner for two years in customer development. She is a model employee \nwho has character, integrity, and is hard working.30  \n \nI have considered all of the awards, certificates and other documentary evidence \npresented by Applicant. I have considered all of the character letters provided. The \nletters attest to Applicant being a devoted and good mother. Applicant is a hard worker \nwith a model work ethic and commitment to accomplishing the mission. She is a \nprofessional with integrity and dedication to her job. She is considered by those who \nprovided character letters to be a patriotic and loyal citizen, who is trustworthy and very \ncapable of handling classified information. They recommend her for a security \nclearance.31 \n \n26 Tr. 90, 95. \n \n27 Tr. 53. \n \n28 Tr. 106-118. \n \n29 Tr. 120-124. \n \n30 Tr. 125-130. \n \n31 AE E, F, G, H. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has a significant history of not meeting her financial obligations. She \nhas delinquent debts totally more than $19,000. She settled one delinquent debt and is \nmaking monthly payments for attorney\u2019s fees. However, she has not contacted most of \nthe creditors and has not made an effort to pay some of smallest debts. I find there is \nsufficient evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because she has many delinquent debts that \nremain unpaid. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant experienced \nsome unfortunate circumstances with her divorces and child custody issues that have \naffected her finances. She moved several times due to her employment and marital \nsituation that also impacted her finances. However, she also had a delinquent debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) from 2003 that she neglected to pay and only recently settled in March \n2009. She has another debt to a beauty salon (SOR \u00b61.c, $95) from 2003, that she \nstated she was unaware she owed and remains unpaid. She has some small medical \ndebts unpaid, and a pizza delivery debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m, $65) for nonsufficient funds that \nhave been delinquent since February 2008. She has not contacted many of her \ncreditors. I find that some of the conditions that resulted in her financial problems were \nbeyond her control. Others were within her control. Applicant is paying her attorney\u2019s \nfees, but has not addressed most of her other delinquent debts. She owes large \namounts on her corporate credit cards that she admitted she also used for personal \nexpenses. She blames her husband for depleting their account. She was using the \ncards prior to marrying her second husband. Applicant did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances in addressing all of her delinquent debts. I find mitigating condition (b) \nonly partially applies. \n \n \nIt is unclear what type of counseling Applicant is receiving from her cousin, but it \nappears she is making an attempt to understand her finances. She did not provide a \nbudget or a plan on how she intends to resolve her delinquent debts. I find mitigating \ncondition (c) only partially applies because there are not clear indications the problem is \nbeing resolve. \n \n \nApplicant has not contacted many of her creditors and has not paid most of the \nsmall debts that she owes. I find she has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay her \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts. She disputes one of her delinquent \ndebts, but did not provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of her dispute or \nother actions to resolve the debt. Therefore, I find mitigating conditions (d) and (e) do \nnot apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Navy and \nreceived an honorable discharge. She is a valued employee, who is trusted and \nrespected. She has earned praise from her coworkers and friends. She had difficult \ndivorces and a child custody battle that impacted her finances. She moved due to \nemployment opportunities and personal choices. It is clear that her child custody issues \ncreated a financial burden. Applicant also has debts that were incurred while in the \nNavy and when she was employed. Many of the debts are small. She has not contacted \nmany of the creditors to set up a payment plan or resolve the debts. She has two large \ncorporate credit card debts that she was reimbursed for, but stated her husband took \nthe money. She also admitted that some of the charges incurred were for personal \nexpenses. Applicant is paying her attorney\u2019s fees and has a $40 monthly payment plan \nfor one of her debts. She did not provide a budget or a plan for addressing her other \ndelinquent debts. At this juncture, based on her financial history, it is too early to \nconclude that she is resolving her financial problems. It does not appear that Applicant \nhas a gambling problem. However, considering her financial situation, her actions of \ngambling money for entertainment, when she could have paid some of her small debts, \nraises questions about her commitment to resolving her delinquent debts. Applicant \nneeds a systematic realistic plan for resolving her debts. Once she establishes that and \na track record of regular payments, she can reapply for a security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:  1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.m-1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.o-1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On May 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on June 25, 2009, and requested that\na decision be made without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) to Applicant on October 8, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nOctober 13, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information.\nApplicant did not submit any additional information. The case was assigned to another\n\n2\nadministrative judge on February 5, 2010. It was reassigned to me on February 22,\n2010. Based upon a review of the written record eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 62, and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR, with the exception of\n1.e., which he denies. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He also\nsubmitted additional statements supporting his request for a security clearance.\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits substantiate, six delinquent debts\ntotaling $30,316. Applicant admits five debts totaling $28,039. Regarding each of the\ndebts he admits, Applicant states that these debts are related to a small business the\nApplicant owns with his wife. (Answer; Item 6.) Regarding allegation 1.e., the Applicant\ncontends that he has disputed the charges on this account, which date from the 1990s.\n(Item 4; Item 7 at 6.) However, he did not provide any documentary evidence to support\nhis claim.\nApplicant maintains that he first learned of these debts in September 2008. (Item\n7 at 6.) In February and September 2009 Applicant stated that the business he and his\nwife own was in trouble financially. He further indicated in both statements that the\ninventory of the business would eventually be liquidated to pay debts. (Answer; Item 6.)\nNo evidence was introduced showing that there has been an improvement of the\nbusiness, or that a liquidation had been started. The record is otherwise void of any\nstatement regarding how the Applicant intended to pay this debt.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n3\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n4\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, has over $28,000 in past due debts,\nall of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose several years ago, and continue to the present. In addition,\nApplicant has failed to provide any evidence that he is paying any of his debts. He\nstates that the company inventory may be liquidated to pay the debts, but has submitted\nno evidence to show that this has been done. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to submit\nevidence showing that his financial situation has improved.  He has not done so.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g.,. . . a business downturn . . . ), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances.\u201d  Applicant submits that the debts were incurred because of a small\nbusiness he owns with his wife. He did not submit any evidence supporting this\nstatement, or provide a reasonable plan for resolving the debts.\nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  A mere\nstatement that he intends to pay the debts at some undetermined time in the future is\ninsufficient evidence to conclude that he has acted responsibly towards his debts. There\nis no track record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is $28,000 in debt, I cannot\nfind that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\n\n5\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is under financial strain,\nand has been so for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(3), Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find\nthat there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at\nthe present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On July 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology\nSystems), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) of Department of\n\n\u201c[T]he offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under\n1\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n[S]o much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances,\n2\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n2\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case\nbe decided on the written record. On January 29, 2010, after the close of the record, Administrative\nJudge Noreen Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge erred in not applying\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition \u00b6 17(c), and (b) whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant e-mailed a nude photograph of himself to a co-worker from\nhis company-issued laptop computer.  The Judge also found that Applicant downloaded about 122\npersonal pictures, to include four nude photographs of himself, onto his company-issued laptop\ncomputer in violation of the company code of conduct.  The Judge concluded that the sexual\nbehavior security concerns were mitigated, but that Applicant failed to mitigate the concerns that his\nactions raised under Guidelines M and E.\nApplicant argues that, under Guideline E, the Judge erroneously failed to apply Guideline\nE \u00b6 17(c).  His principal argument in support of applying the mitigating condition was the fact that\n1\ntwo years have passed since the events of concern took place.  While it is true that the Judge did not\nspecifically reference this particular mitigating condition when analyzing the case under Guideline\nE, she did specifically reference the fact that the conduct occurred in 2007 when detailing her reasons\nfor not applying any of the mitigating conditions under Guideline M.  Under Guideline M, the Judge\ndid specifically consider Mitigating Condition \u00b6 41(a),  and determined that it did not apply.  This\n2\nmitigating condition contains the same consideration of the passage of time as the Guideline E\nmitigating condition that Applicant claims was erroneously ignored. After a reading of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision in its entirety, the Board concludes that the Judge adequately considered the relevant\ncircumstances and concluded that they were not sufficient to extinguish the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Applicant has not established harmful error.\nApplicant relies on two Hearing Office decisions to support his argument that the Judge\nshould have concluded that his case was mitigated.  The Board gives due consideration to these\ncases.  However, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover,\nHearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See\nISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  Notwithstanding some factual similarities,\nthe cases cited by Applicant contain no matters that establish error on the part of the Judge.\n\nThe Judge did conclude that the government\u2019s case under Guideline D had been mitigated.\n3\n3\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She discussed the applicability of the Adjudicative Guidelines under\nGuidelines M, E, and D at some length, but then indicated why no mitigating conditions were\navailable to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns under Guidelines M and E.  \n3\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation\nfor her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On July 27, 2009, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline M (misuse of\n2\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\nThe Government submitted seven items to support its case.\n3\n2\ninformation technology), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline D (sexual\nbehavior).\n.\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and admitted allegations in \u00b6 1.b and \u00b6\n2.b of the SOR. He denied the other allegations in the SOR because he claimed there\nwas no \u201cnudity\u201d in the photo. He elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu\nof a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on October\n8, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on December\n3\n1, 2009, and was provided an opportunity to file objections and submit material to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Applicant submitted additional\ninformation in a timely manner. The case was assigned to me on January 7, 2010.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline M, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant emailed\na nude photograph of himself to a coworker in about December 2007 from his company\nissued laptop computer while employed with a defense contractor. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the\ngovernment alleged Applicant downloaded approximately 122 personal pictures, to\ninclude four nude photographs of himself onto his company issued laptop computer, in\nabout December 2007, in violation of the company Code of Conduct. He submitted a\nresignation in lieu of termination. \nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a the same information\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The government also alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. the same information\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nUnder Guideline D, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a the same information\nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. After a thorough review of the pleadings, and exhibits, I make\nthe following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 54 years old. Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force from 1973 until\n1994, and held a security clearance. He graduated from college in 1995 (Item 5). Since\nMarch 2008, he has worked as a senior technical writer for a defense contractor. He\nalso held a clearance during his civilian employment until his resignation in 2008 (Item\n6).\nApplicant worked as a civilian employee with various contractors from\napproximately 1998 until 2008. In December 2007, while employed with a defense\ncontractor, Applicant uploaded approximately 122 personal pictures to his work\ncomputer. Four of the pictures were full frontal nude pictures of Applicant. Applicant\nedited one of the full frontal nude photos by adding a \u201clong black tie\u201d that covered his\ngenitals. He then emailed the photo to a coworker. Applicant\u2019s coworker, who was also\na friend, informed the security officer of the company about receipt of the photo. She did\n\n3\nnot file any complaint against Applicant. However, the security manager filed a\ncomplaint (Item 6).\nAn investigation conducted by Applicant\u2019s employer revealed that Applicant\u2019s\nwork laptop computer had personal pictures of Applicant including four nude pictures.\nApplicant\u2019s program manager interviewed him as part of the investigation. The manager\ndiscussed a performance plan with Applicant. Applicant was put on a three month\nprobation period. Applicant decided to resign from his employment in January 2008\n(Item 7).\nApplicant admitted that he downloaded the pictures, and that he emailed the\nphoto in question to his coworker. He explained that they were friends. He argued that\nhe had sent previous jokes to her that included items of a sexual nature. He denied that\nthe photo was a nude one. Applicant disagrees with the characterization of the photo\nthat he sent to his coworker. He explained that he superimposed a tie on the photo and\nthat the tie was \u201cintentionally exaggerated\u201d in length and width to cover a lot more than\njust the genitals (Response to FORM). He asked that a review of the photo in question\nbe made before \u201ckilling his 36-year-career.\u201d Applicant also argued that the photo was\nnot intended as one of a sexual nature. He claimed it was meant as a cartoon-type\nlampoon on \u201ccasual Friday.\u201d He also elaborated that he knew he violated company\npolicy by storing personal photos on the computer and emailing the photo to his\ncoworker. He believed that the violation was diminimus given the practices of other\nemployees in the organization (Item 4).\nApplicant stated that he put the nude pictures of himself on his work computer\nbecause he wanted to have them before he started a weight loss program. His reason\nfor putting them on the work computer rather than his home computer was because he\nfeared his family might find them during the Christmas vacation in December 2007\n(Response to Form). He stated this was a temporary measure and he fully intended to\nremove them from the work computer. To support this premise, he explained that he did\nnot store the photos on a CD or zip drive (Response to Form).\nApplicant proffers that his employment record is exemplary and he has\nmaintained strict responsibility and accountability for a great deal of secret information.\nHe claims he has never had any problems with handling classified information during\nalmost 36 years of work (Item 4).\nApplicant acknowledged that this was not a responsible thing to do and that he\nrealized that he used poor judgment. He realized that his actions violated the Guidelines\nand the company code, but he argued that the company code of conduct is stretched\nand broken daily. He admitted that he learned a lesson from the incident and that he is\nsure it will not happen again (Item 4).\nApplicant completed his recent SF 86 and listed the reason that he left his\nprevious position. He explained that he left by mutual agreement after allegations of\nmisconduct. He specifically stated that he used his work computer for personal use and\nhe elaborated that he had stored personal pictures, including four of himself, that were\nnude (Item 5).\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are: (1) the nature, extent, and\n5\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n5\nmitigating conditions is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines must be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof a clearance. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline M (misuse of information technology systems), at AG \u00b6 39, Guideline E\n(personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15, and Guideline D (sexual behavior) at AG \u00b6 12.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n7\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\n\n5\nAnalysis\nMisuse of Information Technology Systems.\nUnder Guideline M, \u201c[n]oncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39). The government presented sufficient information\nto support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Applicant admitted using his computer\nat work to send the photo to a coworker. He admitted that he downloaded approximately\n122 photos of himself, which included four frontal nude shots. Despite the fact that\nApplicant put a long tie on his photo, the photo emailed to the female coworker was of a\nsexual nature. He further admitted that his actions violated company policy. The\ninformation requires consideration of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 40(e)\n(unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system) and \u00b6 40(f)\n(introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or\nfrom any information technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules,\nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations).\nThe record does not support consideration of Guideline M mitigating conditions\nlisted in AG \u00b6 41. This conduct occurred in December 2007. Applicant minimized his\nactions, although he acknowledged that it was against company policy. He believes his\nlong career should overcome any security concerns. Applicant has not demonstrated\nhow his actions do not reflect adversely on his current \u201creliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not\napply. The other mitigating conditions are not applicable.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, available information requires consideration of the disqualifying\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) (a pattern of rule violations), 16(d)(4) (evidence of\nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources) and AG \u00b6\n16(e) (1) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about ones\u2019 conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding). Certainly, Applicant\u2019s violation of company policy by sending the photo of\nhimself partially covered to his female coworker on his company issued computer is\n\n6\nconduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional\nand community standing.\nThe mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) and AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability, to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) do not apply. Applicant cooperated\nwith the investigation after the complaint was made. He did not alert his employer that\nhe had downloaded approximately 122 personal pictures of himself, including four\nfrontal nude ones. It was the female coworker who alerted a security manager.\nApplicant has minimized his actions and believes that although his actions were\nimproper, they are on the end of the continuum where more consideration could be\ngiven, especially in light of his long career.\nSexual Behavior.\nThe security concerns about Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior, as expressed in the AG\n\u00b6 12, is that \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicated a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No\nadverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on\nthe sexual orientation of the individual.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress) is an applicable disqualifying condition. Applicant had\nfull frontal nude photos of himself on work computer. \nAG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of\ndiscretion or judgment) is an applicable disqualifying condition. Applicant\u2019s decision to\nsend the photo of himself to his female coworker, whether nude or partially nude,\nreflects lack of judgment and discretion. The coworker alerted the security manager\nabout the photo. Thus, it can be inferred that it was of an unwelcome nature.\nAn applicant might be able to mitigate Guideline D security concerns. One such\nmitigating condition (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation,\nor duress), AG \u00b6 14(c) may apply. Applicant disclosed the fact that he had left his\nposition by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct. He elaborated on his\nSF 86 that he had personal pictures on his work computer, including four of himself that\nwere nude. The government, security officials, and previous employer are well aware of\nthe incident. I do not believe Applicant would compromise national security to avoid\npublic disclosure of the incident. Any sexual behavior security concerns pertaining to the\nincident are dealt with more thoroughly under Guideline M and Guideline E in this\ndecision. Sexual behavior security concerns are mitigated. \n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n7\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines M, E, and D. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult who served in the military. He held a security\n9\nclearance for many years. However, when working for a defense contractor in 2007, he\ndownloaded approximately 122 photos of himself, including four frontal nude ones, to\nhis work issued computer. He knew this violated company policy. His reasoning for\ndoing so is suspect. Applicant then sent one of the photos to a female coworker.\nDespite the fact that Applicant believed the \u201clong tie\u201d did not make the nude frontal\nphoto of himself offensive, the coworker took the photo to the security manager.\nApplicant\u2019s inappropriate use of his government computer, his poor judgment, and his\nminimalization of his behavior when responding to the SOR, leaves me with doubts as\nto his judgment. His rationale that the company rules are often stretched and that this\nincident should be overlooked in light of his long career, causes me to question his\nreliability. He acknowledges his mistake and is sorry for the incident. The positive\ninformation about Applicant is insufficient to overcome the adverse information about his\nconduct at his previous job under Guideline M and Guideline E. This raises serious\ndoubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s recent conduct does not\nmitigate the security concerns under these guidelines. He has mitigated the security\nconcerns under the sexual behavior guideline, but because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, my doubts must be resolved in favor of\nthe national interest.  \n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nFOR Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied\n                             \n                                                    \nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns arising from his\ndelinquent finances and falsification of two security clearance applications. Clearance is\ndenied.\nOn May 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nE, Personal Conduct, H, Drug Involvement, and F, Financial Considerations. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 1, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept those set forth in SOR subparagraph 1.c and 1.e. He requested a hearing, and\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nthe case was assigned to me on September 10, 2009. On September 22, 2009 a Notice\nof Hearing was issued scheduling the case for October 14, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. I received six government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nThe transcript was received on October 19, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old single man with two children, ages 11 years and eight\nweeks. He was married from 2006 to 2009 (Exhibit 1 at 22). The marriage ended in\ndivorce in March 2009. Applicant\u2019s oldest child is a product of his marriage, and the\ninfant is the child of his fiancee with whom Applicant currently lives. Applicant has\nphysical custody of the 11-year-old child.\nApplicant attended junior college in 1996. He withdrew before earning a degree,\nthen re-enrolled in four-year college in 2000 (Exhibit 4 at 3). He attended college for four\nyears, but did not earn a degree (Tr. 19). Since leaving college, Applicant has worked\nas a security guard for two successive contractors at the same facility (Tr. 19). \nApplicant used marijuana from 1995 to 2004 (Tr. 20). He smoked once in high\nschool in 1995 and used it at parties while in college (Tr. 20). Applicant\u2019s marijuana use\n\u201ckind of carried over\u201d into his career (Tr. 20) In 2004, Applicant\u2019s employer administered\na random drug test (Exhibit 4 at 12). Applicant failed it, testing positive for marijuana\n(Id.). His employer then placed him on probation for 90 days (Id.). Applicant\u2019s employer\nadministered two more random drug tests, and Applicant passed both (Id.). \nApplicant attributes his 2004 marijuana use to depression that stemmed from\nproblems he was having with his then girlfriend (Tr. 21). He has not used marijuana\nsince 2004.\nIn September 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application\n(Answer). He answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 27 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug\nActivity - Illegal Use of Drugs  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is\nshorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance . . . ?), and 28 (Your Use of\nIllegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive Positions  Have you EVER\nillegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer,\nprosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a\nposition directly and immediately affecting the public safety?). \nIn May 2008, Applicant completed another security clearance application, and\nagain, failed to disclose his past marijuana use either in response to Questions 27 or 28\n(Answer). He also did not disclose this information when he met with a security\nclearance investigative agent the following month (Answer).\nApplicant testified that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2004 security\nclearance because his supervisor told him that \u201cit was between me and him, and that it\nwouldn\u2019t show up on my record, and he would keep it off my record\u201d (Tr. 23). He did not\n\n3\ndisclose the marijuana use on the 2008 application or to the investigator because he\n\u201cdid not want to lose [his] career as a security officer\u201d (Answer at 2).\nApplicant owes eight creditors approximately $14,000 of delinquent debt (see\ngenerally, Exhibits 5-6). Approximately $13,200 constitute student loans (SOR\nsubparagraphs 3.b - 3.e). Applicant owes the remainder to utility companies, (SOR\nsubparagraphs (SOR subparagraphs 3.a, 3.f, and 3.i), and a credit card company (SOR\nsubparagraph 3,g).\nSOR subparagraph 3.a is a cable television bill for $452 stemming from\nApplicant\u2019s marriage (Tr. 26). In response to government interrogatories propounded in\nFebruary 2009, Applicant indicated that he planned to begin paying this bill through a\npayment plan beginning March 2009 (Exhibit 3 at 8). He provided no evidence that he\nhas been making any payments.\nApplicant contends that he had arranged payment plans to satisfy the debts\nlisted in SOR subparagraphs 3.b, 3.f, and 3.g, but was unable to adhere to them\nbecause he \u201chad to pay mortgage, gas, [and] other bills,\u201d and his funds \u201chaven\u2019t been\nthat great\u201d (Tr. 26, 27). \nApplicant denied the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 3.c, 3.d, and 3.e. He\ncontends that he paid them through wage garnishments. He provided no supporting\nevidence (Tr. 24). Applicant has not yet begun making payments to satisfy the $140\nphone bill listed in SOR subparagraph 3.h (Tr. 27).\nApplicant attempted to consolidate his debts through a debt management\ncompany (Tr. 35). He did not specify when he considered this option. He chose not to\npursue the debt consolidation option because the debt management company would\nnot include all of his debts in the proposed plan (Tr. 35). For the past month, a family\nfriend has been helping Applicant manage his finances (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant maintains a budget (Tr. 28). He has approximately $500 remaining\nafter expenses. His budget does not account for any of the SOR debts (Tr. 38).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows:\nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate (AG \u00b6 15).\nApplicant intentionally omitted information about his drug involvement history\nfrom his 2004 and 2008 security clearance applications, and during a 2008 interview\nwith an investigative agent. The following disqualifying conditions apply:\nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant\u2019s contention that his supervisor advised him not to list his failed drug\ntest on his 2004 security clearance application conceivably triggers AG \u00b6 17(b):\n\n5\nthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused\nor significantly contributed to by improper advice of authorized personnel\nor legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically\nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for omitting his failed drug test or drug involvement history from\nhis 2004 application contradicts his explanation for omitting his drug involvement history\nfrom the 2008 investigative process. Consequently, I conclude his contention that he\nrelied on his supervisor\u2019s advice when completing the 2004 security clearance\napplication is not credible. Moreover, Applicant presented no evidence establishing that\nhis supervisor was authorized to advise him on the completion of his security clearance\napplication. AG \u00b6 17(b) is not applicable.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s contention that he omitted his drug involvement history from\nthe 2008 security clearance application is more credible than his explanation for\nomitting the information from the 2004 application, it does not mitigate the security\nconcern. Fear of losing one\u2019s job does not justify falsification (DISCR OSD No. 89-1586\n(October 26, 1990) at 4). \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24).\nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and his failed drug test trigger the application\nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use.\u201d After\nfailing the drug test in 2004, his employer administered two more random drug tests. He\npassed both, and has not used marijuana since the episode that triggered the failure of\nthe drug test. AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b)(3),\n\u201can appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d apply.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\n\n6\nOnly two of Applicant\u2019s delinquent bills, collectively less than $1,000, relate to his\nseparation and subsequent divorce. Applicant accrued the student loan debts before he\nwas married, and did not testify to any relationship between these debts and his\ndivorce. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant has made minimal progress toward satisfying his delinquencies, and\nacknowledges that financial hardship has derailed previous efforts to satisfy his\ndelinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201c. . . there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved, or is under control,\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant contends that he satisfied several of the SOR delinquencies through\nwage garnishments, but provided no supporting documentation. Assuming that\nApplicant\u2019s contention is true, such payments do not constitute \u201cgood-faith effort[s] to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d sufficient for AG \u00b6 20(d) to apply.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent. Moreover, nearly five years have\nelapsed since he last used it. His marijuana use no longer poses a security concern. \nConversely, Applicant repeatedly omitted information about his marijuana use\nduring the course of two security clearance investigations over a four-year span of time.\nThis conduct undermines his credibility, thus minimizing the probative value of his\npromises to get his financial situation under control. Upon evaluating this case in the\ncontext of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the drug\ninvolvement security concern, but failed to mitigate the personal conduct and financial\nconsiderations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She did not serve in the U.S. military. Her file \ndoes not contain any adverse information relating to police involvement. For example, \nshe has never been charged with a felony, any firearms or explosives offense(s), and \ndoes not have any currently pending charges. She has never been charged with any \noffenses related to alcohol or drugs. There is no evidence that she has abused alcohol \nor drugs. She has not been arrested for or charged with any other misdemeanor-level \noffenses. She has worked for the same employer, a defense contractor, since \nNovember 2007. Applicant seeks a security clearance in conjunction with her \nemployment. \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 16 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $29,316. In addition, Applicant\u2019s February 25, 2009, Personal Financial \nStatement (PFS) indicates her monthly expenses exceed her monthly income. Her PFS \ndoes not address repayment of the delinquent debts set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.e. \n \n \n2 Item 4 (March 2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nand1.g. to 1.p.3 The 16 delinquent SOR debts consist of one judgment and her \nremaining debts are collection and charged off accounts.  \n \nIn her July 10, 2008, Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant admits that she \n\u201c.  .  .  was a full time student and was unable to find employment while attending school \nand simply got behind on her financial obligation[s].\u201d4 Applicant further states in her PSI \nthat she \u201c.  .  . is expecting to establish payment arrangements for any and all \noutstanding financial obligations,\u201d and states with her new job and better pay she \nbelieves she will be able to resolve her financial obligations.5 \n \nThe only documentation provided by Applicant to demonstrate that she has a \npayment plan arrangement in place for SOR \u00b6 1.f.; however, Applicant has not provided \nany proof that she has actually made payments under that arrangement.6 Applicant has \nfailed to provide any documentation demonstrating that she has either satisfied or \nestablished payment arrangements for the remainder of her debts. While some of her \ndebts are not listed on her more recent credit reports, Applicant must demonstrate that \nshe has resolved her debts.7 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she stated: \n \nI have attached some documents to this letter which show my effort in \ntrying to take care of my debts. I am still working on getting in touch with \nthe rest of my creditors, even though it has been difficult to get hold of \nsome [of] these creditors, hence [I am] unable to locate some [of] my \naccounts. It is my deepest desire to get this issue resolved. \n \nThe documents she attached consisted of a letter dated September 4, 2009 from \na debt reduction program. Included among her documents were four letters to creditors \nfrom the debt reduction program advising the creditors not to call the Applicant. \nApplicant offered no evidence in her FORM response that demonstrated any of the \ndebts alleged had been resolved. \n \n \n \n \n3Items 1 and 6. \n \n4 Item 5. \n \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Item 6. \n \n7 See ISCR case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. July 30, 2008) (The Board has previously noted \nthat it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation regarding satisfaction of \nindividual debts.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, in her \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, and in her SOR response. Applicant\u2019s SOR listed 16 \ndebts including a judgment and 15 collection and charged off accounts totaling \napproximately $29,316. Her financial difficulties extended over several years and \ncontinue today. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Her delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because she did not establish that her financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether she is fully committed to resolving her delinquent SOR \ndebts and is making adequate steps to do so. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because she \ndid not provide any documentation disputing any of the SOR debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by what \nshe described as her inability to find employment while attending school, which caused \nher to fall behind on her debts. However, she has not provided sufficient evidence to \nestablish that she acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to her \ndelinquent SOR debts since obtaining her current job in November 2007.8  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant consulted a company offering a debt \nreduction program; however, this did not occur until long after she received her SOR. \nFurthermore, there is no record evidence establishing that her debts are resolved or \nunder control. There is no record evidence that Applicant has paid, started payment \nplans, disputed, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. She did not provide \nspecific timelines for setting up payment arrangements of any SOR debts. These are \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nsome initial, positive \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d \nShe has admitted her responsibility for most of the SOR debts and promised to \neventually resolve them. She established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because \nshe showed some good faith9 in the resolution of her SOR debts by admitting \nresponsibility for most of her SOR debts.  \n \nApplicant denied responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o. and 1.p. for $473 and \n$110, respectively. She claimed that she made a payment arrangement with these \ncreditors, but as noted, she did not provide any documentation that she has actually \nmade payments under that arrangement.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her submitted documentation regarding her \nrecent enrollment in a debt reduction program leaves too many questions unanswered. \nHer steps are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of her clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for volunteering to \nsupport the Department of Defense as an employee of a defense contractor. There is \nno evidence that she has a criminal record or has ever violated security. There is every \nindication that she is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, her \nemployer, and that she is an honorable person. She does not abuse alcohol or illegal \ndrugs. She has never been fired from a job or left employment under adverse \ncircumstances. Her file does not contain any adverse information relating to police \ninvolvement. She deserves some credit for enrolling in a debt reduction program, but \ndocumentation presented is inadequate to demonstrate financial responsibility. \nCumulatively, these factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial. Failure to pay or resolve her just debts is not prudent or responsible. \nApplicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. She began to have financial \ndifficulties several years ago, when multiple debts became delinquent. In February \n2009, she responded to DOHA interrogatories, and June 2009, she responded to the \nSOR. She had ample opportunity to contact more of her SOR creditors and to make \ngreater progress in the resolution of her SOR debts. She did not pay, start payments, \ndispute, or otherwise resolve any SOR debts. She made insufficient progress to resolve \nher delinquent debts, even though she had steady employment and ample opportunity \nto contact her creditors and provide documentation. She was on clear notice from her \nreceipt of DOHA interrogatories and even more so after she received the SOR that she \nneeded to show substantial progress in the resolution of her delinquent debts; however, \nshe did not provide documentation showing her efforts to accomplish this security \nresponsibility.    \n   \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful \nconsideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the \ngovernment\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.q: \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Mendez, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case\nOn April 9, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs), effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 10, 2010, and elected to have her case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nNovember 4, 2010\n\n2\nMaterial (FORM) on July 19, 2010, and did not respond with any information within the\n30 days permitted.  The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2010.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 30 delinquent\ndebts, exceeding $18,000.  Specifically, his listed debts comprise creditor 1.a ($468);\ncreditor 1.b ($214); creditor 1.c ($242); creditor 1.d ($398); creditor 1.e ($769); creditor\n1.f ($492); creditor 1.g ($36); creditor 1.h ($492); creditor 1.I ($905); creditor 1.j ($986);\ncreditor 1.k ($694); creditor 1.l ($1,075); creditor 1.m ($972); creditor 1.n ($272);\ncreditor 1.o ($7,473); creditor 1.p ($1,087); 1.q ($5,424); creditor 1.r ($91); creditor 1.s\n($905); 1.t ($986); creditor 1.u ($337); creditor 1.v ($713); creditor 1.w ($954); creditor\n1.y ($3,418); creditor 1.z ($257); creditor 1.aa ($1,135); creditor 1.bb ($347); creditor\n1.cc ($406); and creditor 1.dd ($1,1187). Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have\npetitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, and converted the petition to one for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 1998 (receiving his discharge in June 2002).  \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the alleged debts, and\ndenied others.  She disputed a number of the debts, and committed to making progress\nin the resolution of her remaining debts.  She requested six months to enable her to\nmake good-faith attempts in clearing her delinquent debts.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old executive administrator for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant first married in 1996. She has a child from this marriage (Items 5 and\n8).  Her first husband abandoned her in March 2002, and left her with insufficient\nincome to pay her bills and care for her child.  Her divorce was finalized in July 2004\n(Item 8).  She has since remarried and claims improved finances. (see Item 8)\nApplicant attended college between September 1990 and September 1992 and\nreceived an associates degree in business management in August 2007. (Item 5)  She\nheld administrator positions with several companies before joining her current employer\nin November 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reveal a considerable history of financial difficulty.  In\nMarch 1998, she petitioned for Chapter 13 relief.  She converted her Chapter 13\npetition into a Chapter 7 straight bankruptcy petition in June 2001, and received her\nChapter 7 discharge in June 2002.  (see exs. 8 and 13)\nFollowing her divorce, Applicant accumulated a number of additional delinquent\ndebts. Altogether, she accrued delinquent debts exceeding $18,000. She attributes\nthese additional debt problems to her ongoing divorce, and failure of her former\nhusband to provide any financial assistance. (Item 8)  One of the largest debts (creditor\n1.o) involves a 2006 car repossession following her current husband\u2019s loss of\n\n3\nemployment, and an ensuing deficiency balance of $7,473. (Items 8 and 11) Another\ndebt (creditor 1.a) involves a $468 judgment entered against her in December 2006.\n(Items 8 and 11). Her remaining listed debts cover assorted medical and credit card\ndebts, some of which are unknown to her. (Items 8 and 11)   \nIn an effort to address her debts, Applicant contracted a debt consolidation firm\nin November 2008. (Item 8) Records show that she identified her listed creditors from\nher credit report and signed a payment agreement with the counseling firm. (Item 8)\nUnder the terms of her agreement, she obligated herself to pay the firm $377 a month\nto make and fulfill payment agreements with her covered creditors. (Item 8)  \nApplicant does not document any payment progress with her debt consolidation\nfirm. Nor does sjhe provide any proofs of addressing her creditors individually.\nIn the personal financial statement that Applicant furnished as a part of her\ninterrogatory answers in January 2009, Applicant reported net monthly income of\n$2,437 for herself and $1,959 for her spouse. (Item 8). After allowing for $3,160 in\nmonthly expenses, she claimed a net monthly remainder of $638. (Item 8)  She has not\nprovided any proof of disputed debts with her creditors, or efforts to negotiate any\nsettlements, reduce payments, or engage any credit counseling agent to assist her in\naddressing her debts.  \n                           \nApplicant provided no endorsements or documentation of community activities\nand awards. Nor did she provide any performance evaluations or military service\nrecords. \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \n\n4\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n5\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an executive administrator with a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during her two marriages. Her\naccumulation of additional delinquent debts following her divorce from her first\nhusband and bankruptcy discharge, and her past inability and unwillingness to\naddress these debts, warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC\n\u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to her divorce from her first husband\nand her current husband\u2019s inability to find well-paying work following his layoff in 2006.\nTo date, she has been unable to document any follow-through with the debt\nconsolidation program she agreed to, or payment arrangements with any of her listed\nindividual creditors. Collectively, her remaining delinquent debts exceed $18,000, and\nhave not been fully addressed to date.    \nBased on the documented materials in the FORM, some extenuating\ncircumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s inability to pay or otherwise resolve her\ndebts.  Partially available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly.\u201d Without more information from\nApplicant about the efforts she has made to resolve debts that are hers and dispute\nthose she denies, the evidence is insufficient to credit her with responsible corrective\nmeasures once her finances improved.\nMoreover, some judgment problems persist, too, over Applicant\u2019s unexplained\ndelinquencies and her failure to demonstrate she acted responsibly in addressing her\nlisted debts with the net monthly remainder she and her current husband claimed in\nJanuary 2009. Mitigation requires a demonstration of earnest repayment efforts once\nthe unemployment conditions that contributed to the delinquencies had passed or\neased, and her finances had improved. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n24, 2004). \nNot only are Applicant\u2019s listed debt delinquencies ongoing, but she has failed to\naddress them in any tangible way. Mitigation credit is not available to Applicant based\non the evidence developed in this record.         \n                                          \n\n6\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).\nFailure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve her debts when\nable to do so raises security-significant concerns about whether the applicant has\ndemonstrated the trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by her accumulation of delinquent debts. Since reporting  a\npositive remainder in 2009, she has not shown enough manifest effort in addressing\nany of her covered debts to mitigate her still delinquent accounts.  Resolution of her\ndelinquent accounts is a critical prerequisite to her regaining control of her  finances.\nWhile divorce and unemployment conditions might have played a considerable\nrole in her accumulation of so many debts over recurrent periods, Applicant failed to\nprovide any explanatory material for consideration.  Potentially helpful endorsements\nand performance evaluations were not provided either. Overall, clearance eligibility\nassessment of Applicant based on the limited amount of information available for\nconsideration in this record does not enable her to establish judgment and trust levels\nsufficient to overcome security concerns arising out of her accumulation of delinquent\ndebts.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, her lack of any exhibited explanations for her debt\naccruals, and her failure to provide any proof of  corrective actions taken to address\nher old debts, it is still soon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s\nability to repay her debts and restore her finances to stable levels commensurate with\nthe minimum requirements for holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.dd. \nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a through 1.dd:\n     Against Applicant\n\n7\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 23, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On April 11, 2011, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider, or mis-\nweighed, record evidence; whether Applicant was prejudiced by unreasonable delay in processing\nhis security clearance application (SCA); and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a market manager for\na Defense contractor.  He served in the Air Force from 1984 until his retirement 20 years later.  He\nheld a security clearance while on active duty.  Applicant is responsible for each of the nine\ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR that have been charged off or otherwise neither paid nor\nresolved.  Applicant\u2019s claims to have paid off most of these debts, except for two, were not\ncorroborated.  Applicant\u2019s debts were accumulated during his marriage.  Some of them were jointly\nowed with his wife and some were in Applicant\u2019s name alone.   \nIn the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge concluded that, except for the two paid\ndebts, Applicant had failed to demonstrate responsible action in regard to his financial problems.\nHe noted that Applicant has been employed for two-and-a-half years and has the capability to\naddress his financial problems.  The Judge stated that \u201cthe limited amount of information available\nfor consideration\u201d precluded a conclusion that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation.  Decision at 6.  \nApplicant claims that his case took too long to process.  He states that he completed his SCA\nin 2007 and that, as a consequence of alleged delay,  the Judge\u2019s decision was based upon outdated\ncredit report information.  We resolve this issue adversely to Applicant.  The record contains four\ncredit reports.  Three of them, dated April 2010, November 2009, and September 2007 respectively,\nwere included by the Government in the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  The fourth, dated\nFebruary 8, 2011, was provided by Applicant in his response to the FORM.  These reports,\nconsidered together in light of the other record evidence, support the Judge\u2019s findings and\nconclusions.  Applicant has provided no reason to believe that the evidence before the Judge was\nnot reasonably up to date or that the time involved in processing his case prejudiced his ability to\npresent evidence in mitigation.  See ISCR Case No. 04-06517 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 21, 2005).\nMoreover, there are no statutes of limitations or analogous deadlines for how soon a SOR must be\nissued after submission of a SCA, after a subject interview, or after the occurrence of other\nprocessing milestones.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-07360 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2002).  Applicant\nhas failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the manner in which his case was processed.\n\n3\nApplicant also contends that the Judge should have gathered more information to show that\nhis financial situation has improved.  However, \n[u]nder the Directive, the Administrative Judge has no obligation to gather\ninformation for either party in a case.  The Directive makes clear that it is the\nresponsibility of each party to present evidence for a Judge to consider in a case.\nFurthermore, the correspondence sent to Applicant with the [FORM] put him on\nadequate notice that it was his responsibility to gather and present evidence for the\nJudge to consider in his case.  ISCR Case No. 03-00759 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 16,\n2005).  (internal citations omitted)  \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider record evidence favorable to him, such\nas his military career, his having previously held a security clearance, and improvements in his\ncredit score.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal presentation is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.  Neither is it sufficient\nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01168 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2011).  In support of\nhis appeal, Applicant presents matters not contained in the record, such as information about his\ncredit score obtained after the date of the Judge\u2019s decision.  We cannot consider this new evidence\non appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the\nAppeal Board.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 09-07792 at 2 (App. Bd. May 10, 2011).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his use of information\ntechnology systems and his personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nStatement of Case\nOn April 23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs), implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs on September 1, 2006.\nApril 11, 2011\n\n2\nApplicant responded to the SOR, undated,  and elected to have his case decided\non the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) on January 24, 2011, and submitted additional information for consideration in\nFebruary 2011, within the 30 days permitted. Applicant\u2019s submissions were identified as\nAE\u2019s A through C and admitted. The case was assigned to me on February 28, 2011.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated nine delinquent debts\nexceeding $54,000. The alleged debts are listed as follows: creditor 1.a ($3,986);\ncreditor 1.b ($10,032); creditor 1.c ($4,200); creditor 1.d ($4,512); creditor 1.e ($5,850);\ncreditor 1.f ($14,333); creditor 1.g ($2,452); creditor 1.h ($6,148); and creditor 1.i\n($3,204).\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the listed debts with\nexplanations.  He claimed certain of his accounts had been closed in the past without\nidentifying any of the creditors.  He also claimed that most of the accounts were joint\naccounts that were in dispute with his ex-wife.  And he claimed that a new credit report\nwill reflect that he is actively paying all of the accounts one by one.  Applicant attached\na January 14, 2010 letter from a credit collection agency that does not appear to match\nany of the creditors or accounts covered in the SOR. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old defense market manager for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. Applicant enlisted in the Air Force (USAF) in February 1984\nand served 20 years of active duty. (Item 1) While on active duty with the USAF, he\nheld a security clearance. He received his honorable discharge in March 2004.  \nApplicant married his spouse in December 1993 and divorced her in August\n2006. (Item 1)  He has two children (ages 23 and 25) from this marriage. (Item 1)\nDuring their marriage, Applicant and his wife accumulated many debts: some of\nthem joint and some of them accrued from individual accounts. In August 2006,\nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his wife was finalized. (Items 1 and 5) Since their final decree\nwas entered, they have waged disputes over who should be principally accountable for\nthe joint bills. Each of the debts listed in the SOR represent accounts opened\nindividually by Applicant and, as such, debts that belong solely to Applicant.\nCredit reports show nine delinquent debts in Applicant\u2019s name that have since\nbeen charged off and not otherwise paid or resolved.  Altogether, there are nine such\ndebts listed in the SOR that total in excess of $54,000.  See Items 6 through 8.  Of\nthese listed debts, Applicant is credited with resolving just two: creditors 1.d and 1.h.\n(Items 6 through 8) While Applicant claims to have paid off most of the listed debts, his\nfurnished documentation does not corroborate his claims.\n  \n\n3\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made\nabout whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following  individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\n\n4\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a defense market manager of a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during an extended period of marital\nestrangement and contentious divorce proceedings. He denied being delinquent on\nany of the accounts listed in the SOR and claimed he paid off most of his accrued\ndebts and is committed to paying off the remaining ones. \n Each of Applicant\u2019s listed debts are documented in the produced credit reports\nand reflect debts opened individually by Applicant and provide corroboration of his\ndebts. His accumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to\naddress all but two of them (creditors 1.d and 1.h) warrant the application of two of the\n\n5\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nMoreover, some judgment problems persist over Applicant\u2019s unexplained\nindividual delinquencies and his failure to demonstrate he acted responsibly in the\npast in addressing these listed debts that he never claimed to belong to his ex-wife.\nSee ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004). Not only are most of his\nlisted debt delinquencies still outstanding, but he has failed to address them in any\ntangible way that can be verified in the developed record. \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).\nFailure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts when\nable to do so raises security-significant concerns about whether he has demonstrated\nthe trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his contentious separation and\ndivorce proceedings which deprived him of the joint spousal income he historically\nrelied on to satisfy his marital and individual bills. All but two of the listed debts in the\nSOR are either unpaid or unresolved. In his most recent correspondence, he pledged\nto pay off his listed debts, one at a time. (Item 2 and AE A-C)  \nBased on the evidence, some extenuating circumstances are associated with\nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay off or otherwise resolve his debts. Available to Applicant in\npart is MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibly.\u201d But this mitigating condition has only partial application to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances. For Applicant has been fully employed for the past two and one-half\nyears, and by all written accounts, he has been fully able to address his individual\ndebts and document his progress.  \n                                     \nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts and failure to\naddress all of them responsibly with the resources at his disposal during the two plus\nyears he has been gainfully employed by his current employer. \nWhile ongoing divorce proceedings and the absence of spousal cooperation in\naddressing his debts might have played a considerable role in his accumulation of his\ndebt delinquencies, his continuing failure to take more documented steps to pay or\notherwise resolve his individual delinquent debts remains a continuing source of\nsecurity concern. Supervisory endorsements and performance evaluations might have\nbeen helpful, too, in making a whole-person assessment of his overall clearance\n\n6\neligibility, but were not provided.  Overall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant\nbased on the limited amount of information available for consideration in this record\ndoes not enable him to establish judgment and trust levels sufficient to overcome\nsecurity concerns arising out of his accumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations and his lack of any acceptable explanations for his\ndeclinations to address his remaining delinquent debts after his wife declined to help\nhim, it is still too soon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to\nrepay his debts and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with the\nminimum requirements for holding a security clearance. Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, 1.d\nthrough 1.g, and 1.i. Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.d and 1.h.   \nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.g, and 1.i      Against Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.h:\n                For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 16, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP), on May 13, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On June 15, 2009, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and J (Criminal\nConduct) concerning the Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on July 25, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non August 24, 2009. I received the case assignment on August 26, 2009. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on September 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nOctober 13, 2009. Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were\n\n2\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant Exhibits A through F, which were also received without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on October 22, 2009. Applicant requested the\nrecord remain open until October 30, 2009, in order for him to submit additional\ninformation. He did not submit any additional evidence and the record closed on\nOctober 30, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 26, and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to\nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nParagraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits allegations 1.a. through 1.g. in the SOR. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denied allegations 1.h. through 1.j.\n1.a.\nApplicant admits that he owes a creditor $1,154 for a past due account. At\nthe hearing, the Applicant expressed some confusion concerning the status of this debt.\nHe was given an opportunity to submit evidence showing that this debt was paid or\notherwise resolved. He did not submit any additional information. I find that this debt is\nApplicant\u2019s, it has not been paid, and he has no current intentions to pay this debt.\n(Government Exhibit 7; Transcript at 44, 65-66, 92-94.)    \n1.b.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a wireless telephone company in\nthe amount of $1,188 for a past due account. This debt has not been paid, and the\nApplicant has no current intentions to pay this debt. (Government Exhibit 7; Transcript\nat 44, 66-67.)\n1.c.\nApplicant admits that he owes a creditor $86 for a past due account.\nApplicant has indicated several times that he would resolve this debt, but has not yet\ndone so. This debt has not been paid. (Government Exhibit 3; Transcript at 45, 67, 94.)  \n    \n1.d.\nApplicant admits that he owes a creditor $588 for a medical debt. The\nstatus of this debt will be discussed along with 1.e., below.   \n1.e.\nApplicant admits that he owes the same creditor in 1.d. $276 for a second\nmedical debt. Applicant states that he made a payment arrangement with this creditor to\npay $478 to resolve both debts, but has not yet made the payment. This debt remains\nunpaid. (Government Exhibit 7; Transcript at 45, 67-70; 94-95.)    \n1.f.\nApplicant admits that he owes a debt for a repossessed automobile in the\namount of $6,235. The original debt was for $9,235. He made an initial payment of\n\n3\n$3,000 and was to make payments of $100 per month beginning in September 2009.\nHe was given an opportunity to submit evidence showing that he was paying this debt.\nHe did not submit any additional information. This debt is still due and owing.\n(Government Exhibit 7; Applicant Exhibit A; Transcript at 37-38, 45-46, 71-73.)\n1.g.\nApplicant admits that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of $862.\nHe states that he has made a payment agreement with this creditor to begin payments\nstarting November 2009. There is no information that Applicant has made payments on\nthis debt. It is still due and owing. (Government Exhibit 3; Transcript at 47.)\n1.h.\nApplicant denies that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of $500.\nAt the hearing, Applicant agreed that he owes this debt, but he indicated some\nconfusion as to the collection agency currently owning the debt. He was given an\nopportunity to submit evidence showing that this debt was paid or otherwise resolved.\nHe did not submit any additional information. Based on the available information, I find\nthat Applicant has not paid this debt and has no current plans to pay this debt.\n(Government Exhibit 1 at question 28, Exhibit 2 at 28; Transcript at 47, 95.)\n1.i.\nApplicant denies that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of\n$275.16 for a bank debt. Applicant stated that he had to pay this debt in order to open\nhis current bank account. He was given an opportunity to submit evidence showing that\nthis debt was paid or otherwise resolved. He did not submit any additional information.\nBased on the available information, I find that Applicant has not paid this debt.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 20; Transcript at 48, 96.)\n1.j.\nApplicant denies that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of $2,900\nin restitution. As further described under Paragraph 2, below, Applicant was arrested\nand convicted for stealing $4,500 from a bank where he was a teller. As part of his\nsentence, he was required to pay $6,500 in restitution. Applicant has given conflicting\nstatements as to when he paid this debt off. He was given an opportunity to submit\nevidence showing that this debt was paid or otherwise resolved. He did not submit any\nadditional information. Based on the available information, I find that Applicant has not\npaid this debt. (Government Exhibit 2 at 25-26; Transcript at 49-50, 96-98.)\nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated that he made poor financial choices when\nhe was younger. His current financial situation is stable, and he has no new debts that\nare currently past due. He intends to resolve the remainder of his past due\nindebtedness. (Transcript at 52.) He also submitted evidence showing that he\nsuccessfully paid off additional debts that were not alleged in the SOR. (Transcript at\n39-44; Applicant Exhibits B, C and D.)\nParagraph 2 - Guideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct. Applicant admits both\nallegations under this paragraph, 2.a. and 2.b. Those admissions are hereby deemed\nfindings of fact.\n\n4\nApplicant was employed as a bank teller from February to September 2006. In\nJuly 2006 Applicant stole $4,500 from his teller drawer. He was eventually discovered\nby investigators for the bank, and terminated. Subsequently, he was arrested for Grand\nTheft. He was convicted and sentenced to three years probation and to make restitution\nin the amount of $6,500. The probation was due to expire in March 2010. Applicant\nmaintains that he has paid the restitution, but failed to provide documentation to support\nhis statement. Applicant has expressed extreme remorse for his conduct and states that\nnothing like this will ever happen in the future. (Transcript at 31-35, 54-65.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted unsigned statements from a co-worker, a former roommate,\nand his fianc\u00e9e. The co-worker states, \u201cI believe [the Applicant] to be a trust worthy\nemployee capable of handling and abiding SAR program requirements as not to\njeopardize national security, or company policies.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit F at 4.) The\nstatements from his former roommate and fianc\u00e9e are also laudatory in speaking of his\ncurrent good judgment and honesty. (Applicant Exhibit F at 5-6.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, as well as his or her knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, has over $14,000 in past due debts,\nall of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n6\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ The Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties are of a longstanding nature. The Applicant has paid off some debts\nthat were not alleged in the SOR. However, he did not submit any evidence showing\nthat any of the debts listed in the SOR have been paid, even the smallest one of $86.\nThe evidence is meager as to how he is going to pay his remaining past due debts. It is\nthe Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that this mitigating condition applies\nto this case.  He has not done so.  \nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors, or otherwise\nresolve the debts.  However, there is no track record of his making payments for a\nconsistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable, which makes it\nmitigating where \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Finally, given the fact that he is at least $14,000 in debt, I\ncannot currently find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved\nor is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c). He has not mitigated the Government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns regarding his financial situation. Guideline F is found against the\nApplicant.\nParagraph 2 - Guideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are\napplicable:  AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c)\n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(d) \u201cindividual is\ncurrently on parole or probation.\u201d \nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that two of the Mitigating\nConditions under Criminal Conduct do apply to this case. AG \u00b6 32(a), states it may be\nmitigating where, \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d In addition,\nAG \u00b6 32(d) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \nApplicant has never denied that he engaged in extremely poor judgment when he\nstole money from his teller drawer in 2006. From all indications, this was a momentary\n\n7\nand deeply regretted failure of judgment, that occurred more than three years before the\nrecord closed. He is successfully employed, and has been very open with his employer\nand the Government about this incident. Under the particular circumstances of this\ncase, he has mitigated the security concerns about his criminal conduct. Guideline J is\nfound for the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I\ncannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation at\nthis time.  If he is able to pay down his debts, or otherwise resolve them, he may be\neligible for a clearance in the future.  He is not eligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. As\nstated above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on March 26, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nApril 16, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 22, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing on June 11, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 3, which were\nreceived and entered into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf, and he submitted no exhibits. At the request of Applicant, the record remained\nopen until June 25, 2009, to allow Applicant to offer post hearing character letters. No\nevidence was submitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 18,\n\n2\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.g., under\nGuideline H, 2.a. under Guideline E, and 3.b. under Guideline J. He denied 2.b. and\n3.c., with no response given for 3.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. Applicant\nworks for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection\nwith his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists seven allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H. As stated above, all of these allegations were admitted by\nApplicant in the RSOR, although his testimony, as will be reviewed below, differed from\nthe SOR in terms of dates of usage. They will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency,\nfrom approximately 1998 to at least 2007. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he\nactually last used marijuana in May 2007, and from 2005 till his last use in 2007, there\nwere times when he used marijuana every day and other times when it was used\napproximately two times a week (Tr at 28). From 1999 until 2005, he generally used it\non a daily basis, and most of what he used he purchased from friends (Tr at 34).\nApplicant testified that although he was marijuana dependent, he intends to never use\nmarijuana again (Tr at 52-53).\n1.b. The SOR alleges that Applicant used cocaine, with varying frequency, from\napproximately 1998 to at least 2007. He testified that he last used cocaine on one\noccasion in 2007, and before that his last usage had been in 1999 (Tr at 29-30). He\nestimated that he used cocaine, which he purchased from friends, a total 20 times. \n1.c.  The SOR alleges that Applicant used hallucinogens, with varying frequency,\nfrom approximately 1998 to at least 2007. He testified that he last used hallucinogens,\nspecifically mushrooms, on one occasion in either 2006 or 2007, and before that his last\nusage had been in 1999 or 2000. He estimated that his total mushroom usage was less\nthat four times (Tr at 29-31). \n\n3\n 1.d. The SOR alleges that Applicant used depressants, with varying frequency,\nfrom approximately 1998 to at least 2007. He testified that he last used depressants,\nspecifically the prescription drug, Xanax, in 2004 or 2005, and he estimated that he\nused it in total 20 times. He also purchased Xanax from friends.  (Tr at 32-33).  \n1.e. The SOR alleges that Applicant used stimulants, with varying frequency,\nfrom approximately 1998 to at least 2007. He testified that he last used stimulants or\nspeed in 1999, and he estimated that he only used it 2 times in total  (Tr at 34-37). \n1.f.  The SOR alleges that Applicant spent approximately $200 per month on\nillegal substances.  Applicant testified that this average purchase amount, that he\nestimated to be correct, continued on for a period of many years (Tr at 37-38). \n1.g.  The SOR alleges that Applicant distributed and/or sold marijuana to his\nfriends between 1998 and 2007. Applicant testified that he did sell marijuana to his\nfriends over a period of many years, although he had no estimate as the total amount\nhe sold (Tr at 45-46).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), which was\ncertified on May 14, 2008 (Exhibit 1).  Question #24 of the SCA asked if, since the age\nof 16 or in the previous seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally used\nany controlled substance? Applicant answered \"No\" to this question, and he listed no\nillegal substances. The Government alleges, and the evidence is clear that Applicant\nshould have included all of his illegal drug usage as included in subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.e., above.  In his RSOR, Applicant wrote in response to this allegation, \u201dI\nadmit, but I never saw this form before or held a clearance. I was unaware it was for the\nDoD I thought it was a job application.\u201d \nAt the hearing Applicant conceded that he knew he was not being honest in\ncompleting this SCA, but he claimed that he thought it was only part of the job\napplication, not a Government questionnaire to apply for a security clearance. He  did\nnot include any of his illegal drug usage, because he thought it could potentially hurt his\nchances of getting a job (Tr at 38-43). \n2.b.  During a July 8, 2008 interview with an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense, Applicant indicated that he last used illegal substances and/or\nprescription medication prescribed to someone other than himself, when he was 25\nyears old, in approximately 2005, rather than his actual last usage which was in at least\n2007.\n\n4\nApplicant testified that he did not believe he provided incorrect information to the\ninvestigator, regarding the dates of his drug usage. He argued that the dates that are\nthe basis of the SOR allegation are taken from the information he furnished to the\ninvestigator. However, in reviewing the statement made to the investigator as part of a\nReport of Investigation (ROI), which was verified in Exhibit 3, it appears that Applicant\ndid identify his last usage of marijuana in 2005, when he was 25, not the correct date of\n2007, as he has admitted. Additionally, the dates that were used in the SOR, came from\nApplicant\u2019s responses to interrogatories, which is also part of Exhibit 3. Finally, while it is\nnot alleged in the SOR, it indicates in the ROI that Applicant stated he only used\ncocaine on two occasions, which contradicts his testimony at the hearing, that he used\ncocaine on 20 times, as referred to in 1.c., above. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct. \n3.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1, subparagraphs a.\nthrough g., constitutes criminal conduct. All of Applicant\u2019s drug usage, drug purchase\nand drug sale did constitute illegal conduct. \n3.b. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 2, subparagraphs a. and\nb., constitutes criminal conduct. Applicant also committed criminal conduct by furnishing\nincorrect information to the Government on an SCA and to an investigator. \n3.c. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 2, constitutes a violation\nof Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, which is a felony.\nApplicant\u2019s furnishing incorrect information also is a violation of Title 18, United States\nCode, Section 1001, which is a felony. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including primarily the possession, and use,\nfor many years of marijuana, and other illegal substances as well, is of great concern,\nespecially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall\nconduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug abuse) and (c) (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s many years and frequency of  use of illegal substances,\nand his lack of candor in the information about his drug involvement that he furnished to\nthe Government, I can not conclude at this time that Applicant\u2019s conduct comes within\nany Mitigating Condition (MC). \n\n6\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has failed to introduce persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against\nhim.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete, untruthful answers regarding the extent of his drug\ninvolvement on an SCA that he executed on May 14, 2008, and during an interview with\na Government investigator on July 8, 2008.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nDC 16. (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and\nfalsification of relevant facts from a personnel security questionnaire, which was used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility. DC (b) also applies since Applicant deliberately\nprovided false relevant information to the Government investigator. I can not find that\nany Mitigating Condition (MC) applies in this paragraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant\nengaged in criminal conduct, by his using illegal substances for many years, and\nknowingly providing false and misleading information to a Government investigator and\non a  security questionnaire, the last two of which are felonies.\nDC 31. (a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this\ncase. DC 31. (c), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, is also applicable to this case. There is no MC under\nCriminal Conduct. Paragraph 3, Guideline J is found against Applicant\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H, E, and J in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s long history of using\nmarijuana and other illegal drugs, and his lack of honesty and candor with the\ninformation he furnished to the Government, I find that the record evidence leaves me\nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. -1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.-2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.-3.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact At the time of the hearing, Applicant had recently turned 26. He is a professional writer working for a government contractor. He has worked for his present employer for about two years and is seeking to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) position designated ADP I/II/III. In 2007, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in marketing. He is single. During high school, Applicant began smoking cigarettes. Then in October 2001, as a 16 or 17 year old upperclassman, he tried marijuana \u201cas a one time thing.\u201d He 1 also experimented with alcohol. Despite these \u201csilly decisions,\u201d he entered his senior year with a 3.95 grade point average, an SAT score of about 1350, and was ranked seventh in his class. As class president in his sophomore and junior years, he was considered an exemplary student and leader. During his senior year, he experienced a 2 personal crisis.

On August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating trustworthiness concerns\narising under Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended\n(Regulation); and the revised guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of\nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2005. \nIn an undated response received on September 22, 2009, Applicant admitted all\nnine allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the\ncase to me on November 16, 2009. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a\nhearing date of January 12, 2010. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on\nDecember 22, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony\nand offered six documents, accepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.)\nA-F. Three witnesses appeared on his behalf. Applicant was given through January 25,\n2010, to submit any additional documentation. Department Counsel offered four\nMarch 31, 2010\n\n Tr. 25.\n      1\n Tr. 25-28.\n      2\n Tr. 31.\n      3\n Tr. 32, 75.\n      4\n Tr. 34.\n      5\n2\ndocuments, admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-4 without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the\nproceeding was received on January 19, 2010. On January 22, 2010, Applicant\nsubmitted two documents through Department Counsel, who forwarded them without\nobjection on January 26, 2010. They were received on February 1, 2010, and accepted\ninto the record as Exs. G-H. The record was then closed. Based on a review of the\ntestimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant met his burden regarding the drug\ninvolvement trustworthiness concerns raised. \nFindings of Fact\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had recently turned 26. He is a professional\nwriter working for a government contractor. He has worked for his present employer for\nabout two years and is seeking to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) position\ndesignated ADP I/II/III. In 2007, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in marketing.\nHe is single. \nDuring high school, Applicant began smoking cigarettes. Then in October 2001,\nas a 16 or 17 year old upperclassman, he tried marijuana \u201cas a one time thing.\u201d  He\n1\nalso experimented with alcohol. Despite these \u201csilly decisions,\u201d he entered his senior\nyear with a 3.95 grade point average, an SAT score of about 1350, and was ranked\nseventh in his class. As class president in his sophomore and junior years, he was\nconsidered an exemplary student and leader.  During his senior year, he experienced a\n2\npersonal crisis. Despite his strong religious faith, he felt conflicted with desires for\npopularity, girls, and a \u201cpartying\u201d lifestyle.  Temptation prevailed, and those desires\n3\ndistracted him from his academic, personal, and religious goals. He even sold some of\nhis marijuana to friends, a practice that continued in college.4\nBy the time he entered college in September 2002, he was \u201cexhausted\u201d from\nbeing an exemplary student and developed \u201ca complete disregard\u201d for rules.  His\n5\npartying  continued and his behavior became erratic. He used marijuana daily and\nsometimes imbibed alcohol. His growing use of cigarettes started him on the path to a\npack a day nicotine habit. When he discovered his girlfriend of over two years had\ncheated on him with a  friend, he felt betrayed and sought total escape. He drank\nalcohol alone. He bought and tried hallucinogenic mushrooms four or five times\nbetween 2002 and 2003, and sold one to a friend. As an underclassman, he tried\nopium once. Between 2002 and 2007, he used cocaine that he purchased about 10\ntimes and, at times, shared the drug with friends. He lost all motivation to concentrate\non his studies and his life. He became sexually promiscuous. He developed a sense of\nrage, and started getting into fights. As a result, he suffered several serious injuries. He\n\n Tr. 36.\n      6\n Tr. 78-79.\n      7\n Tr. 107, 109.\n      8\n Tr. 82-84.\n      9\n Tr. 89-90.\n      10\n Tr. 101.

I was in\ndarkness a lot.\u201d  \n6\nMeanwhile, Applicant\u2019s mother, a single mother employed as a school teacher\nand guidance counselor, continued to pay for him to attend a prestigious university. She\ntoiled to keep him in school, while he failed classes and partied. He was cited for\npossession of a fake identification card outside a local nightclub before he was asked to\ntake a leave of absence from school in 2003.  The university urged him to reconsider\n7\nhis academic and personal future and seek counseling, which he completed with a\nuniversity psychiatrist.  In December 2003, while on an out-of-state road trip, he was\n8\narrested and charged with possession of marijuana during a traffic stop.  The charge\n9\nwas ultimately dismissed. In March 2004, he got intoxicated, scaled a fire escape, and\ndamaged a door in an effort to relieve himself.  He was arrested and charged with\n10\nmarijuana possession, illegal entry, and destruction of property. He pled guilty to\ndestruction of property and was sentenced to a year of probation and 20 hours of\ncommunity service.  Being underage, he was advised to refrain from alcohol. He was\n11\nalso subjected to weekly drug testing, which he passed.12\nApprised of the changes in Applicant\u2019s life, his family sent him abroad to an\nidyllic region in which they had relatives in order to put his life into perspective. He\nrested in Europe, but also indulged in alcohol and used cocaine on a few occasions. He\nreturned in 2004 refreshed. He returned to his college town, prepared to go back to his\npart-time restaurant work, but he was told he was no longer needed.  He was\ndisappointed at this development and his mother feared he would regress to his former\nlifestyle. She advised him to consult his college\u2019s dean. Knowing of Applicant\u2019s\nstruggles and understanding his current need for structure, the dean had him re-\nenrolled in classes that week. Despite his return, he was \u201cconsumed\u201d with needing to\nfeel accepted.  His probation for the December 2003 incident commenced in October\n13\n2004. He refrained from buying and using drugs until his probation ended.\n\n Tr. 43. In 2002, when he was a teen, Applicant had a fight with his mother in their car while outside an\n      14\nairport during Thanksgiving break. A passing police officer saw the fracas and Applicant was cited for\ndisorderly conduct. The charge was dismissed.

That night, he felt that he had hit rock\n14\nbottom and he began a struggle to regain his faith.  He returned to college in the\n15\nautumn and gradually started to study, mend his ways, make repentance for his old life,\nand behave like a responsible adult.  By March 2007, he had ceased using cocaine\n16\nand purchasing all illegal drugs.  In July 2007, after graduating from college, he\n17\nbecame sexually abstinent and started using drugs infrequently. In October 2007, he\nreturned to his church. For one last time on February 14, 2008, he used marijuana, a\ndrug which, at that point, he rarely used.  That night, he decided to quit using all illegal\n18\ndrugs.  He has not used any illegal drugs since that time. In August 2008, in a final\n19\neffort to Iead a dependency-free life, he accepted a challenge from his pastor to\nconquer his dependence on cigarettes. Soon thereafter, he apparently did so by going\n\u201ccold turkey.\u201d He turned his attention to work, where he was soon lauded for his\n\u201coutstanding perseverance, initiative, and intellectual creativity and . . . great analytical\ngift.\u201d  He returned to his faith with vigor, regularly attending church services, tithing,\n20\nbecoming a Sunday school teacher, and joining the church band.  He also sought\n21\ninformal counseling through regular meetings with his pastor regarding his old lifestyle,\nand his faith. He also met with the church\u2019s youth pastor to help him with personal\n\u201caccountability.\u201d  \n22\nToday, Applicant feels he has been given a second chance at living a clean,\nmoral life.  He does not associate with people who use drugs. He also avoids\n23\nsituations and venues where drugs might be present.  He vows that he \u201cwill never use\n24\ndrugs again.\u201d  He signed a notarized statement noting, \u201cI hereby declare that I will\n25\n\n Tr. 117.\n      26\n See, e.g., Tr. 119.\n      27\n Tr. 118.\n      28\n Ex.

If any violation occurs, I understand\nthat my position of public trust will be automatically revoked.\u201d To handle stress, he relies\non his faith and what he learned from his past experiences.  Applicant also finds\n26\npleasure in his music, piano, guitar, working out, church activities, and prayer.  He\n27\nattributes his turnaround \u201cto God, but [also] maturity.\u201d  He regrets how long it took him\n28\nto mature and regain his confidence. He has reconciled with his mother, with whom he\nspeaks on the telephone \u201cpractically every day.\u201d29\nAt work, Applicant is highly regarded and earns approximately $52,000. When he\nwas initially hired, his position was ill-defined. The way he has developed it has since\nestablished \u201cthe standard by which everybody else will be gauged.\u201d  His employer has\n30\nan anti-drug policy. Applicant recently started his own side-line venture teaching piano\nto children, a calling he enjoys. He hopes to train other teachers in his method and\neventually out-source them to teach other children.  His youth pastor, who has followed\n31\nApplicant\u2019s progress over the past two-and-a-half years and knows about most of\nApplicant\u2019s past problems, noted the personal growth Applicant has shown since they\nmet. He is impressed with Applicant\u2019s movement from self-absorption to caring for\nothers.  In light of Applicant\u2019s past drug use and brushes with the law, the youth pastor\n32\nfinds the Applicant of today to be a role model whose ability to put his past life behind\nhim through faith can help \u201cinfluence others.\u201d  With regard to transparency, the youth\n33\npastor rates Applicant a nine.  An associate who directs an outreach organization\n34\nhelping troubled youth befriended Applicant. He has prayed with Applicant and\nmentored him. He finds Applicant highly trustworthy, and has entrusted him to inspire\nyouth to also use faith to overcome adversity.35\nWith regard to his past drug use and its repercussions, Applicant is highly\ncontrite. He laments the protracted period it took him to overcome a period of rebellion,\ngain maturity, and take responsibility for his actions. He is now guided by his faith and\nhis responsibilities as a role model for youth. He feels that he is now held to a higher\n\n Tr. 186.\n      36\n See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n      37\n See Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1\n      38\n See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n      39\n6\nstandard, strives to meet the goals set forth in his faith, and endeavors to do what is\njust and right.36\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive\npositions.\u201d    \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is\n37\nthat, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  The Deputy Under Secretary of\n38\nDefense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004,\nindicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the\nDefense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of\nDefense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.    \n39\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \n\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      40\ninformation).  \n AG \u00b6 24.\n      41\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      42\n Id. at 24(b).\n      43\n7\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n40\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline H, use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior\n41\naltering substances, and include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and\ninhalants and other substances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a\n42\nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n43\nApplicant admitted using marijuana between about 2001 and February 14, 2008.\nHe admitted selling the substance on some occasions to friends. He bought and used\nhallucinogenic mushrooms four or five times between 2002 and 2004. He sold such a\nmushroom on one occasion during that period. He used cocaine about 10 times\nbetween 2002 and March 2007. He bought and tried opium once in about 2002. In\n2003 and in 2004, he was arrested for possession of marijuana. These admissions are\nsufficient to raise Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany drug\nabuse\u201d) and AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia).\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had recently turned 26. He admitted the\ndrug abuse detailed above. After college, his marijuana use diminished until he gave up\nall drugs in February 2008, over two years ago. Of the illegal drugs at issue, his use of\n\n Ex. H (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated Jan. 22, 2010). The Government argued that the Applicant\u2019s\n      44\nstatement, \u201cmerely states [Applicant\u2019s] future intentions. It does not demonstrate them\u201d in light of Applicant\u2019s\ndrug use before and after his 2003-2004 probation. It does, however, clearly set forth a current expression\nthat he will \u201ccompletely abstain from any and all drug abuse\u201d and notes that \u201cif any violation occurs, I\nunderstand that my position of public trust will be automatically revoked.\u201d This statement substantially meets\nthe unqualified criterion noted in AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) as one of four enumerated examples of \u201ca demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse drugs in the future.\u201d \n8\nmarijuana was, at times, frequent. His drug use developed as a part of a stage of\nunbridled rebellion that started at the end of high school, when he was an exemplary\nteenager and student, and continued until his return to his religious faith gradually led\nhim to quit all illegal drug use in February 2008. By August 2008, he extended his\npersonal turnaround and return to his religious faith by successfully completing the\nhighly difficult task of quitting a pack-a-day cigarette habit. He has been drug-free for\nover two years. Since his complete return to the core of his faith, he has eschewed\ndrugs, those who use them, and venues in which they are present. Applicant signed a\nstatement with automatic revocation of any trustworthiness determination for any\nviolation. He has become intensely involved with his church and community. He now\nserves as a youthful role model for personal salvation and redemption through faith. His\nfree time is now devoted to his religion, working out, and music, an appreciation and\ntalent he endeavors to share with children. He has matured considerably in the past two\nyears, a significant period of time for a man in his mid-20s who graduated from\nundergraduate school in 2007. His religious and professional mentors depict him as\ndiligent, trustworthy, and reliable. Applicant also has embraced his new life and adheres\nto society\u2019s and his religion\u2019s rules. \nThe fact that Applicant used drugs for a significant portion of his life cannot be\ndenied, nor does he deny his past. Instead, he credibly demonstrates appropriate\ncontrition over his past drug use and its legal and interpersonal repercussions. At the\nsame time, he points to what he terms his \u201cdark\u201d stage as the basis for all subsequent\nmaturation, his personal turnaround, and his return to faith. There is no evidence that\nthe rebellion or rage he once experienced is still part of his character. Instead, Applicant\ndemonstrates superior qualities with regard to his priorities, his appreciation of religious\nand civil laws and rules, his professional judgment and talents, and his reliability. Such\nqualities have not only impressed his employer, but also his religious mentors, who\nproudly tout him as a model for the power of personal redemption and improvement. In\nlight of all of the preceding, and in the absence of any evidence Applicant will again\nlose his present faith or level of maturity, Drug Use Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 26(a)\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG\u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse and drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation) apply.  \n44\nAs noted, Applicant intends to remain drug free, an act he first demonstrated by\nforeswearing illegal drugs over two years ago. Two years are significant for a man of his\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1), AG \u00b6 2(a)(3)-(5).\n      45\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), AG \u00b6 2(a)(7).\n      46\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(4), AG \u00b6 2(a)(5).\n      47\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(6)-(7).\n      48\n9\nage. In light of the mitigating conditions raised, drug involvement concerns are\nmitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors.  Here, Applicant used and purchased illegal drugs. While his illegal use of\nhallucinogenic mushrooms, cocaine, and his isolated experimentation with opium was\ncomparatively fleeting, he abused marijuana for seven of his 26 years.  His phase of\n45\ndrug use was brought on as a form of youthful rebellion, against his parent, his religion,\nand his role as an exemplary teen and student.  His collegiate pursuit of sensual\n46\npleasure and self-absorption became all consuming, adversely affecting his\nrelationships, studies, and health.  During this stage, Applicant broke the law and\n47\nabused the parameters of his probation. He eventually hit rock bottom near the end of\nhis college years when he realized the pain his behavior was causing his mother,\nwhose self-sacrifice Applicant ultimately appreciated. After college, he gradually pulled\nhimself together, eschewed drugs and other destructive traits, as he matured, returned\nto his faith, and focused on adult responsibilities.  He no longer associates with those\n48\nwho use drugs or frequents venues where drugs are used. He now inspires others to\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).\n      49\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(9).\n      50\n10\novercome personal adversity through faith.  He has been entrusted to work with\n49\nchildren, extending his interaction beyond Sunday school teaching and outreach\nmentoring to giving piano lessons.\nIn the two years since Applicant has been drug-free, he has greatly matured and\ndemonstrated significant personal progress in the area of personal rehabilitation. He\nhas impressed his employer with his skills and reliability, earned the trust of his religious\nand social mentors, mended his relationship with his mother, remained drug-free, and\nmaintained his resolve to follow the dictates of his faith. While two years is a short\nperiod, it is a significant period in the life of one so young. Moreover, both Applicant\u2019s\npersonal resolve and his ability to change his behavior have been successfully\ndemonstrated in an analogous context. He successfully and abruptly quit a heavy\ncigarette habit he had maintained for almost a decade without the need for a\nprescription drug, nicotine withdrawal device, or other program. He did so solely in\nresponse to a challenge from his pastor, despite the fact that nicotine is generally\nacknowledged as highly addictive and its successful cessation is recognized as an\nextraordinarily difficult feat. This clear demonstration of determination, commitment and\npersonal resolve, in tandem with Applicant\u2019s strong devotion, his reliance on faith, and\nhis network of effective mentors, support his expressed intention and dedication to\nremain drug-free.  There is no indication he will again lapse in favor of illegal drug use.\n50\nThe evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a public trust position. Given all these factors, he has mitigated drug\ninvolvement trustworthiness concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to\nsensitive information.\nARTHUR E.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, his testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 31 years old and has completed about two years of college. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Program Analyst and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, namely that he was indebted in the amount of approximately $88,000.00 in delinquent debt, most of which was an equity line of credit used to pay off his ex-wife. Credit Reports of the Applicant dated March 31, 2008; November 1, 2008; June 9, 2009; and August 16, 2009; collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the SOR.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 22, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated January 24, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On April 9, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 5, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on July 21, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 22,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for August 21, 2009.  The Government offered seven\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant offered twelve exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through\n\n2\nL, which were received without objection.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The\nrecord remained open until close of business on August 28, 2009, to allow the Applicant\nthe opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted two Post-\nHearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B.  The\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on August 28, 2009.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nhis testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 31 years old and has completed about\ntwo years of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Program Analyst\nand is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, namely that\nhe was indebted in the amount of approximately $88,000.00 in delinquent debt, most of\nwhich was an equity line of credit used to pay off his ex-wife.  Credit Reports of the\nApplicant dated March 31, 2008; November 1, 2008; June 9, 2009; and August 16,\n2009; collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the SOR.  (Government\nExhibits 4, 5 6 and 7).  The Applicant has been employed for a defense contractor since\nOctober 2007.\nThe Applicant joined the United States Marine Corps in 1995, and spent nine\nyears and eleven months of successful service.  He was honorably discharged in 2005.\nHis military record includes three combat tours in Iraq, in 2003, 2004 and 2005, and\nshow that  he was a  highly decorated Marine with a stellar career.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nI).  \nThe Applicant explained that a series of unexpected circumstances caused or\ncontributed to his delinquent debt.  In 1998, he married another active duty Marine and\nthey had two children.  Things did not work out, they physically separated in 2004, and\nwere divorced in 2006.  Applicant assumed most of the debt incurred during the\nmarriage, and although he and his ex-wife have joint custody of their two children, the\nchildren reside with the Applicant the majority of the time.  His ex-wife decided that she\n\n3\nno longer wanted responsibility for the children, and she pays no child support to the\nApplicant.  Applicant was forced to leave the Marine Corps because he was left as a\nsingle parent with the possibility that he would be deployed without anyone to take care\nof his children.  Although it was a difficult decision, he left the military in 2005, to provide\na stable environment for his children.  The Applicant was able to find employment, but\nhe did not earn as much as he had previously in the military.  He then took a job in\nresidential real estate that was commission based, and he did not do well.  This caused\nmore financial difficulties and his bills became delinquent.             \nThe debts set forth in the SOR were incurred during the marriage, and as of\nFebruary 9, 2009, they remained owing.  The Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the\namount of $516.00.  The Applicant has paid off the debt and it is no longer reflected as\nowing on his most recent credit report.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Government Exhibit\n6).    \nApplicant disputes the debt to a creditor in the amount of $2,729.00.  He\ncontends that the debt was never his debt.  When he learned of the debt in 2006, he\ncontacted the creditor and informed them that he never authorized the account, that it\nwas apparently a situation of stolen identity and a fraudulent credit card.  The creditor\nacknowledged the fact and told the Applicant that it would be removed from his credit\nreport.  (Tr. pp. 35 - 36).  This was not done and the debt remains on the Applicant\u2019s\ncredit report as owing.  \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $261.00.  Applicant\ncontends that the debt has been paid, as the debt is no longer reflected on his credit\nreport as owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and Government Exhibit 6).    \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $3,632.00.  Since April\n2009, the Applicant has been making monthly payments of $100.00 toward the debt to\nget it resolved.  The creditor has agreed to this payment plan.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).    \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $6,342.00.  The Applicant\nhas been making monthly payments of $100.00 toward the debt to get it resolved.  He\ncurrently owes approximately $5,842.00.  The creditor has agreed to this payment plan.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).\n     \nApplicant was indebted in the amount of $78,108.00.  He explained that in 2005,\nhe obtained an equity line of credit on his home and gave most of the money to his ex-\nwife as a divorce settlement.  Although he had tried to keep the house, his home was\nforeclosed upon in April 2008, and the house was sold.  Applicant is making payments\nof $100.00 monthly toward the debt to resolve it.  He currently owes $75,008.68.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).       \nApplicant has recently reduced his monthly expenses in order to use the\ndisposable money to pay off his delinquent debt.  He has moved close to his job, and is\n\n4\nable to save about $400.00 monthly in gas.  He plans to resolve his indebtedness as\nsoon as possible.  (Tr. p. 47).\nLetters of recommendation from his Security Manager, other professional\ncolleagues and a Retired Marine Colonel, who have known the Applicant for many\nyears, indicate that the Applicant is a high performer who accomplishes all tasks to the\nhighest standards.  He is considered an honorable man, with a strong sense of integrity,\nresponsibility, ambition, trustworthiness and good judgment.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G and\nPost-Hearing Exhibit B).\n        \nAmong the Applicant\u2019s military awards are the Good Conduct Medal a Certificate\nof Achievement, and a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit H).\nExcerpts from the Applicant\u2019s military records reflect that he was on the\nCommanding General\u2019s Honor Roll in 2001, completing the Sergeants Course class\nwith a final cumulative average of 96.94.  He was an excellent leader, high performer,\nconsistently recommended for promotion, and considered one of the finest and\nexceptionally qualified Marines.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  \nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance appraisal reflects ratings of \u201cconsistently\nabove acceptable\u201d and fully acceptable\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit A).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n\n5\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances:\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence also shows that circumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol contributed to his financial indebtedness.  Applicant\u2019s divorce mainly caused his\nfinancial problems.  His ex-wife\u2019s refusal to assist him with their children, his decision to\nseparate from the Marine Corps and take a lower paying job, and his assumption of the\ndebt incurred during the marriage, together caused serious financial difficulties.\nRecently, he has addressed each of his creditors.  He has paid off several of the\ncreditors and set up payments plans with the others to resolve them as soon as\npossible.  He must continue to demonstrate financial responsibility.  Under the\ncircumstances, the Applicant has done his best to be responsible and has made a good\n\n7\nfaith effort to resolve his debts.  He realizes that he must continue to pay off his\ndelinquent debt, and live within his means in order to pay his bills on time.  In the event\nthat he has any future financial problems, his security clearance would immediately be\nin jeopardy.  However, at the present time, considering all of the evidence, the Applicant\nhas introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is\nsufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nUnder Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, his\nfavourable character references and the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or\nother characteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  The Applicant has\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nSamuel Bluck, Esq.\n\nThe two disqualifying conditions are Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19 (a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\n1\nand Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of\n2\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death , divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 30, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On July 23, 2009, after the close of the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  On October 6, 2009 the\nAppeal Board remanded the case back to the Judge for further processing.  The Judge issued an\nOrder, dated February 16, 2010, reopening the record.  Applicant submitted several documentary\nExhibits.  Applicant\u2019s submissions after remand were collated by the Judge into two collections:\nApp. Ex. 2 (this included a brief by Applicant) and App.  Ex. 3 (this also included  the Department\nCounsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits).  The Judge issued a remand decision dated March 29,\n2010, which again denied Applicant\u2019s request for clearance.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nThe Judge found that all but two of the 19 delinquent debts or charged off accounts alleged\nin the SOR are Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts and have been delinquent for a number of years. The\nJudge noted that some of the delinquent debts have been removed from Applicant\u2019s most recent\ncredit report.  The Judge noted the absence of evidence of payment to creditors or efforts to contact\nthem.  He further noted the absence of any specific explanation by Applicant for each debt.  The\nJudge did cite Applicant\u2019s general claims that his debts arose: (1) when he was awaiting prosecution\non felony charges and thus unable to obtain a job; and (2) from identity theft and fraud committed\nby Applicant\u2019s ex-wife.  \nThe Judge concluded that the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances are covered by two\ndisqualifying conditions.   In that context he noted that Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report had\n1\ndeleted some debts without any explanation.  The Judge discussed three mitigating conditions but\nonly gave Applicant credit under one of them, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 20(b),  and that credit was\n2\nonly partial.  The Judge explained that Applicant was entitled to some consideration because of his\ndivorce but that was limited by the lack of evidence of responsible action under the circumstances.\nThe Judge gave Applicant no credit for circumstances pertinent to his criminal conduct.\n\n3\nApplicant relies heavily on Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H, a credit report dated February 25, 2010,\nwhich reflects only four debts for a total of under $1,000.  The Judge cited Exhibit H by name twice\nin his findings of fact.  The Judge\u2019s Analysis section reasonably notes the deletion of debts from\nApplicant\u2019s credit report without any explanation. The Judge clearly considered Exhibit H.  Given\nthe Judge\u2019s reasonable explanation for his analysis of the Exhibit, what remains, at most, is a\ndisagreement about weight.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant argues that he has satisfied the requirements for mitigation and relies on the\ndecision in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) for the proposition that applicants\nare not required to be debt-free, nor are they required to have a plan for immediate or simultaneous\nrepayment of debts.  Applicant states that all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given\nhis circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment of debts, accompanied by\nconcomitant conduct that evidences a serious intent to effectuate the plan.  The Judge here explained\nwhy he could not conclude that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion that he had acted\nresponsibly. The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  He also discussed the applicability of the mitigating conditions from Directive, Enclosure\n2 \u00b6 20 at some length, but indicated with sufficient detail why all but one of the Guideline F\nmitigating conditions were not pertinent to Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances in this case and,\nthus, could not be brought to bear to  alleviate the government\u2019s security concerns.  Given the record\nbefore the Judge, his analysis is sustainable.\nFinally, Applicant cites to two hearing office cases to support his arguments for reversing the\nJudge\u2019s decision.  We give due consideration to these cases.  However, each case must be judged\nupon its own merits.  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  The cases cited by Applicant are factually\ndistinct from his in significant ways.   In any event, Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on\nother Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5,\n2008). \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and reached reasonable conclusions.  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 25, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On December 30, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.

The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn January 25, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 19, 2009, was provided to \nhim by letter dated February 23, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA \ntransmittal letter on March 11, 2009. He was afforded a period of 30 days to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He failed to \nsubmit any materials, comments, or objections in response to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on May 15, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.h, 1.j, 1.n, \nand 1.r. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k-m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.s. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old video teleconference coordinator working for a defense \ncontractor.2 He graduated from high school in June 2000, and shortly thereafter he \njoined the U.S. Army. He served on active duty from August 2000 to June 2002, and \nachieved the rank of private first class. His service was characterized as General, under \nhonorable conditions. While on active duty, Applicant had access to classified \ninformation at the secret level. There is no evidence that he ever compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant married his wife in January 2002. They separated in February 2007, \nand are now pending a divorce. He has no children. In October 2002, Applicant was \ncharged with a felony offense (menacing with a knife). He pled guilty to harassment, \nand was sentenced to two years probation. After six months of good behavior, the \nprobation was terminated.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history is summarized as follows (Item 5): From December 2002 \nto June 2003, he was unemployed. He has been employed from July 2003 to the \npresent. During this period, he worked for nine different employers, most of them for \nshort periods of time. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, \nsince June 2008. Applicant provided no explanations about his December 2002 to June \n2003, period of unemployment, or whether this period of unemployment impacted his \ncurrent financial situation. \n \n \n2  Item 5 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nIn his 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having no debts \nover 180 days delinquent over the last seven years, and having no debts over 90 days \ndelinquent at the time he submitted his security clearance application. He stated, \nhowever: \u201cI\u2019m currently going through a divorce and I\u2019m waiting that to be completed \nbefore I know what exactly I have to pay back . . . I don\u2019t have all the details of my past.\u201d \nHis background investigation included the review of his security clearance applications \nand two credit bureau reports (CBR) from July 2008 (Item 6), and November 2008 (Item \n7).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent and/or charged off accounts totaling \napproximately $29,069, which are listed in the two credit reports. He admitted seven \nSOR allegations totaling approximately $10,379. Applicant provided no explanation \nabout the debts he admitted or denied. He failed to explain how he acquired the alleged \ndebts, why they became delinquent, what he has done to resolve his delinquent and/or \ncharged-off debts, and what he plans to do to avoid similar financial problems in the \nfuture.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within his or her means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all \nof which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability \nto protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated 19 delinquent and/or charged off accounts totaling \napproximately $29,000, many of which have been outstanding for a number of years. \nHe presented no evidence of efforts to pay or resolve his financial obligations. He stated \nthat he was undergoing a divorce; however, he presented no evidence to show how his \n \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nseparation from his wife and pending divorce contributed to his financial problems or \nimpacted on his ability to resolve his debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. His financial problems are ongoing and his evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence that established circumstances beyond his \ncontrol contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his period of unemployment and \nhis separation and pending divorce. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence is not sufficient to show: 1) why was he unemployed; 2) whether this period of \nunemployment and/or his marital problems affected his current financial situation; and \n3) whether he acted responsibly and with judgment under the circumstances.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of effort to contact creditors or to resolve his \ndebts by entering into settlement agreements or payment plans with any creditors. \nOther than the above-mentioned period of unemployment, he has been consistently \nemployed since July 2003. He presented no evidence of efforts to resolve any of his \ndelinquent debts from 2003 to the day he received the FORM. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, there are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. His inability to pay his debts \nshows he is financially overextended. He also failed to present any evidence that he \nreceived financial counseling, and that his financial problems are not likely to recur. The \nremaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for his two \nyears of service on active duty in the U.S. Army. He has been successful working for a \ndefense contractor since June 2008. There is no evidence of any security violation, or \nthat he ever compromised classified information. These factors show some \nresponsibility and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. The sparse record evidence fails to convince me \nof Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.h, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.r. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k-m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.s. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, including all the evidence submitted in App. Ex. 2, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old video teleconference coordinator working for a defense contractor.9 He graduated from high school in June 2000, and shortly thereafter he joined the U.S. Army. He served on active duty from August 2000 to June 2002, and achieved the rank of private first class. His service was characterized as General, under honorable conditions. While on active duty, Applicant had access to classified information at the secret level. There is no evidence that he ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Applicant married his wife in January 2002. They separated in February 2007, and divorced in February 2009. He has a six-year-old child of this marriage.10 In October 2002, Applicant was charged with a felony offense (menacing with a knife). He pled guilty to harassment, and was sentenced to two years probation. After six months of good behavior, the probation was terminated. 5 Included in App. Ex. 3 as Exhibit E. 6 Included in App. Ex. 2 as Exhibit I, and in App. Ex. 3 as Exhibit F. 7 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10. 8 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19. 9 Item 5 (2008 e-QIP",

Security clearance denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 25, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On December 30, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within DoD on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \n \n1  FORM Item 5. \n \nMarch 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn January 25, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 19, 2009, was provided to \nhim by letter dated February 23, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA \ntransmittal letter on March 11, 2009. He was afforded a period of 30 days to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He timely \nsubmitted a response to the FORM that included mitigating evidence.2 The case was \nassigned to me on May 15, 2009. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM was received by DOHA on April 7, 2009, but \nnot forwarded to Department Counsel. I did not receive or consider Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM before issuing the July 23, 2009, denial Decision.  \n \nApplicant appealed the Decision. In his Reply Brief, Department Counsel \nconceded Applicant timely submitted a response to the FORM, which was not provided \nto me before issuing the Decision. The DOHA Appeal Board remanded the Decision \nstating (in its pertinent part): \u201cin the interest of administrative economy, the case is \nhereby remanded to the Judge for further processing.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-10204 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2009).  \n \nOn February 16, 2010, I issued an Order asking Applicant to submit \u201cany \nadditional information he would like for me to consider prior to issuing a decision.\u201d3 \nApplicant\u2019s counsel timely provided a \u201cSubmission of Additional Evidence\u201d (including \nTabs A-L), dated March 1, 2010, which was marked Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex. 2), and \nmade part of the record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s Response to \nApp. Ex. 2 on March 3, 2010, which was marked App. Ex. 3, and made part of the \nrecord.  \n \nIn his response, Department Counsel objected to any documents submitted by \nApplicant in App. Ex. 2, except for three documents Applicant had attached to his \nSeptember 1, 2009, Appeal Brief (included in App. Ex. 3). The three documents are: \nApplicant\u2019s written statement4 (undated); Applicant\u2019s divorce decree,5 dated February 6, \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was not provided to me and it was not considered in my original \ndecision (Decision). See the section entitled \u201cProcedural Issue\u201d on this Remand Decision. \n \n3 The Order and a copy of the delivering e-mail to Applicant\u2019s counsel and Department Counsel was \nmarked as Appellate Exhibit (AE) 1, and made part of the record. \n \n4 Included in App. Ex. 2 as Exhibit C, and in App. Ex. 3 as Exhibit D. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n2009; and a letter from Applicant\u2019s credit counseling services company,6 dated March \n12, 2009. The Government argued, inter alia, that consideration of any documents not \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s appeal would be the same as re-opening the record to consider \nnew evidence. The remaining objections are hearsay objections and objections to the \nweight of the evidence.  \n \nAfter evaluating all of the Government\u2019s objections, I admitted and considered all \nthe documents submitted by Applicant in App. Ex. 2. The documents were admitted \nbased on equity and fairness considerations,7 as well as in the interest of developing a \nfull and complete record.8 The Government\u2019s objections were considered when deciding \nwhat weight, if any, was to be awarded to the evidence in light of the record evidence as \na whole.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.h, 1.j, 1.n, \nand 1.r. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k-m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.s. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, including all the evidence submitted in App. Ex. 2, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old video teleconference coordinator working for a defense \ncontractor.9 He graduated from high school in June 2000, and shortly thereafter he \njoined the U.S. Army. He served on active duty from August 2000 to June 2002, and \nachieved the rank of private first class. His service was characterized as General, under \nhonorable conditions. While on active duty, Applicant had access to classified \ninformation at the secret level. There is no evidence that he ever compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant married his wife in January 2002. They separated in February 2007, \nand divorced in February 2009. He has a six-year-old child of this marriage.10 In \nOctober 2002, Applicant was charged with a felony offense (menacing with a knife). He \npled guilty to harassment, and was sentenced to two years probation. After six months \nof good behavior, the probation was terminated.  \n \n \n \n5 Included in App. Ex. 3 as Exhibit E. \n \n6 Included in App. Ex. 2 as Exhibit I, and in App. Ex. 3 as Exhibit F. \n \n7 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10. \n \n8 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19. \n \n9 Item 5 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n \n10 Applicant\u2019s divorce and child is new information acquired from App. Ex. 2 (L) and App. Ex. 3 (E).  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s work history is summarized as follows (Item 5): From December 2002 \nto June 2003, he was unemployed. He has been employed from July 2003 to the \npresent. During this period, he worked for nine different employers, most of them for \nshort periods of time. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, \nsince June 2008. \n \nIn his 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having no debts \nover 180 days delinquent over the last seven years, and having no debts over 90 days \ndelinquent when he submitted his security clearance application. He stated, however: \n\u201cI\u2019m currently going through a divorce and I\u2019m waiting that to be completed before I \nknow what exactly I have to pay back . . . I don\u2019t have all the details of my past.\u201d His \nbackground investigation included the review of his security clearance applications and \ntwo credit bureau reports (CBR) from July (Item 6), and November 2008 (Item 7).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent and/or charged off accounts totaling \napproximately $29,069, which are listed in the two credit reports. He admitted seven \ndebts totaling approximately $10,379. After a review of the record evidence,11 I make \nthe following findings about Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts: \n \na. All the alleged delinquent accounts are identified as Applicant\u2019s individual \naccounts, except for SOR \u00b6 1.f, in which he is identified as an authorized user;  \n \nb. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.m, and 1.o were deleted from Applicant\u2019s CBR without any \nexplanation;12  \n \nc. SOR \u00b6 1.i was identified as a fraudulent account and deleted (App. Ex. 2 (J));  \n \nd. SOR \u00b6 1.k concerns a check, apparently issued by Applicant that was returned \nfor lack of sufficient funds; and \n \ne. All of the alleged debs are Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts, and have been \ndelinquent for a number of years, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i.  \n \nApplicant failed to present evidence of any payments made towards any the \nalleged delinquent debts since he acquired them, or of any efforts to contact creditors or \nresolve his debts. Around March 2009, Applicant contracted the services of a credit \ncounseling company (App. Ex 2 (I)). Through this service, he disputed and removed \nfrom his CBR some of his delinquent debts. Applicant receives credit for his recent effort \nto clean up his credit report.  \n \n \n11 The review included, in part, the two CBRs offered by the Government\u2019s (Items 6 and 7), Applicant\u2019s \nCBR (dated February 2010, App. Ex 2 (H)), the Equifax credit file (dated December 2008, App. Ex. 2 (J)), \nand the TransUnion dispute results (dated December 2009, App. Ex. 2 (L)). \n \n12 See Equifax credit file (App. Ex. 2 (J)) and the TransUnion dispute results (App. Ex. 2 (L)). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant explained his financial problems started in December 2002, when he \nwas administratively discharged from the U.S. Army because he was pending felony \ncharges. In general, he attributed his financial problems to numerous factors: losing his \nmilitary job; the payment of extensive legal fees for his criminal defense (from \nNovember 2002 until June 2003); his inability to obtain a job while pending a felony \nprosecution; the expenses associated with being involved in a bad marriage and the \nconsequent divorce; his wife\u2019s financial mismanagement; identity theft and fraud \ncommitted by his wife; and his inability to find a stable, well-paying job. \n \nApplicant claimed that after he found out about his financial problems, he took \ncorrective action by placing a fraud alert on his CBR to prevent his wife from engaging \nin additional fraud against him;13 separating from his wife in February 2007, and \ndivorcing her in February 2009; retaining the services of a credit counseling company to \nassist him disputing and removing fraudulent entries from his CBR;14 and engaging in \nefforts to resolve his delinquent debts. Except for disputing some of his debts, Applicant \npresented no evidence of debt payments, negotiations with creditors, or of any other \nefforts to resolve his delinquent debts. \n \nApplicant provided no explanation about the debts he admitted or denied. He \nfailed to explain how he acquired the admitted debts or what he has done to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. He also failed to identify which of the denied debts were incurred by \nhis wife. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n13 Applicant\u2019s February 2010 CBR indicates he asked to be considered as a fraud victim and that an \nextended alert to be placed on his CBR. The CBR does no indicate when he requested such actions. \nApp. Ex. 2 (H). \n \n14 There is no evidence as to when Applicant retained the services of the credit counseling agency. Based \non App. Ex 2 (I), I presumed it was sometime between January and March 2009. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d15 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).16 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n15 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n16 \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and \ndecide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within his or her means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all \nof which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability \nto protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated 19 delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$29,000, many of which have been outstanding for a number of years. He admitted \nseven debts totaling approximately $10,379. All the alleged delinquent accounts are \nidentified as Applicant\u2019s individual accounts, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.f, 1.m, and 1.o were deleted from Applicant\u2019s CBR without any explanation.  \n \nThe CBRs establish the rebuttable inference that debts identified in Applicant\u2019s \nCBR are his debs. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that Applicant\u2019s evidence \nis insufficient to rebut this inference. I also find that all of the alleged debs (except for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, 1.m, and 1.o) are Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts, which have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, \nand AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any mitigating \ncondition. Except for disputing the debts, he presented no evidence of efforts to pay, \nsettle, or resolve his financial obligations. He also failed to present evidence of his \ncurrent financial situation. His favorable information is not sufficient to support the \nconclusion that his financial problems are over, or under control, or that they occurred \nunder such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce constitutes some evidence of a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol contributing to his inability to pay his debts.17 AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only \npartially. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He presented no evidence of efforts to contact creditors or to resolve \nhis debts by entering into settlement agreements or payment plans with any creditors. \nOther than the above-mentioned period of unemployment, he has been consistently \nemployed since July 2003. He presented no evidence of efforts to resolve any of his \nadmitted delinquent debts from 2003 to the day he received the FORM. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n \n17 I do not consider Applicant\u2019s losing his military job, his inability to secure employment, and the payment \nof legal fees because of his criminal misconduct as \u201ccircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control.\u201d  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for his two \nyears of service on active duty in the U.S. Army. He has been successful working for a \ndefense contractor since June 2008. There is no evidence of any security violation or \nthat he ever compromised classified information. These factors show some \nresponsibility and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. His favorable evidence fails to convince me of \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e, 1.g, \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n   1.h, and 1.j \u2013 1.s: \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n   1.m, and 1.o: \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005,\neffective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant admitted all three of the allegations set forth\nin the SOR and requested a hearing. The matter was referred to DOHA on June 1,\n2009, and the case was assigned to me that same day. Department Counsel and\nApplicant agreed to a hearing date of June 24, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued to\nthat effect on June 4, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant was\naccompanied by a friend, gave testimony, offered no documents, and was given\nthrough July 8, 2009, to submit any evidence for consideration. Department Counsel\nJuly 29, 2009\n\n Tr. 26.\n      1\n Tr. 24-25.\n      2\n Ex. C (Nephew\u2019s undated letter).\n      3\n Tr. 34, 37.\n      4\n2\noffered four documents admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-4 without objection. The transcript\n(Tr.) of the proceeding was received on July 6, 2009. On July 7, 2009, Applicant\ntransmitted three documents by facsimile transmission to Department Counsel. They\nwere forwarded to me on July 8, 2009, and accepted into the record as Exs. A-C\nwithout objection. The record was then closed. Based upon a review of the testimony,\nsubmissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her burden regarding the\nsecurity concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old janitorial grounds supervisor who has worked for the\nsame defense contractor for over 25 years. A former janitor, she was promoted to a\nsupervisory position three years ago. She regularly receives high ratings on her\nevaluations and recently received a notable raise.  Applicant earned a high school\n1\ndiploma. Currently single, she became guardian of five nieces and nephews 12 years\nago after the death of her sister. She remained their legal guardian until the two\nyoungest children, who are twins, turned 18 this past year. One of the twins has special\nneeds and will remain with Applicant for the rest of Applicant\u2019s life.2\nIn 2006, an adult nephew of Applicant wanted to go into business with Applicant,\nwhose credit was better than his.  Their plan was to purchase, renovate, and resell or\n3\n\u201cflip\u201d residential properties. That summer, they bought two houses and repaired them\nfor sale. The economy, however, was unfavorable and there was little interest in the\nproperties. Then, in November 2006, one of the homes was vandalized. Items such as\nthe hot water heater and appliances were stolen. The house exterior and lawn were\ndefaced and littered. Applicant feared the investment had been a mistake, realizing they\ndid not have the funds to make all the repairs and keep current on the mortgages. She\nrepeatedly asked the bank for permission to sell the homes short, but permission was\ndenied. Consequently, they continued paying the mortgages on the two houses until\ntheir capital was depleted. With the lenders unwilling to work with her on an alternative,\nthe properties went into foreclosure in January 2007 and April 2007, respectively. \nApplicant believes that the banks have thus far neglected the properties. One\nhouse is currently inhabited, but it is unclear whether it is a legal rental or a squatter\nsituation. The other house is vacant. Applicant has no knowledge of the mortgage\nholders\u2019 intention with regard to the sale of the properties.  At issue in the SOR at \u00b6\u00b6\n4\n1.a through 1.c are home mortgages foreclosed upon for non-payment in the amounts\n\n Tr. 31. Although not at issue in the SOR and not clearly established at the hearing, Ex. 3 (Credit report,\n      5\ndated Oct. 30, 2009) indicates an additional  $160,000 may also be at issue. Tr. 30-33. \n Tr. 34.\n      6\n See, e.g., Tr 34, 37.\n      7\n Tr. 29.\n      8\n3\nof $40,000, $131,000, and $32,966, respectively.  Aside from issues regarding\n5\nmortgages, the homes and properties each have intrinsic values.  Not having yet been\n6\nresold by the lenders, there is no way to calculate Applicant\u2019s ultimate liability, if any.  \n7\nThese obligations were noted on Applicant\u2019s security clearance application.\nApplicant has been forthright regarding these properties and her foreclosures from the\nbeginning of the security clearance process. She has repeatedly approached the\nlenders to permit her to sell the houses short or to otherwise devise a plan to dispose of\nthe properties, but the lenders have been uncooperative. The mortgage foreclosures at\nissue are Applicant\u2019s \u201conly financial problems that are within the past seven years or so.\n. . .\u201d  Otherwise, she lives within her means and continues to support the twins.\n8\nApplicant regrets making these investments. She has found the whole experience, as\nwell as being held in limbo by the lenders with regard to how the matter will be resolved,\nto be an extremely emotional experience.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      9\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      10\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n10\n11\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n13\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n14\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      15\n Tr. 42.\n      16\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.15\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nApplicant and her nephew invested in two properties, planning on re-selling the\nhouses for a profit. The properties did not sell, the banks foreclosed on the mortgaged\nproperties, and Applicant is now deemed liable for approximately $203,000. While it is\nforeseeable that this amount will be reduced when or if the properties are sold, these\nfacts are sufficient to raise financial considerations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG\n\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant freely and willingly accepted her nephew\u2019s business proposal. While\nthe media of the day may have celebrated the profits to be made by \u201cflipping\u201d houses,\nand while Applicant had no control over national or regional real estate market\nconditions, she surely understood that any such venture has its risks. Regardless,\nApplicant has had no control over the fact the lenders have yet to sell or otherwise\ndispose of the properties in nearly a year and a half. Such a sale should offset or\nreduce Applicant\u2019s liability significantly. Moreover, a business downturn is a legitimate\nbasis for mitigation under financial considerations mitigating condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6\n20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d).  There is no evidence, however, Applicant received\n16\nfinancial counseling or otherwise retained a liaison to work with the lenders on her\nbehalf. Similarly, there is no evidence the lenders will soon decide what they will do with\nthe properties. Consequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control\u201d) does not apply. \nAt work and with regard to the guardianship of her nieces and nephews,\nApplicant has demonstrated reliability, dedication, and trustworthiness. With regard to\nher investments, she has expressed regret. She describes the entire unpleasant\nexperience as an emotional one. She is unlikely to make such an investment again. FC\nMC AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies. Moreover,\nshe has tried to work with the banks to either sell the properties short or otherwise\ndispose of the properties. While unsuccessful, she has exerted genuine effort and\ndemonstrated persistence in her attempts. FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) applies. No\nother mitigating conditions apply.\n\n Tr. 42-43.\n      17\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor, she is a highly credible woman who, in her mid-\n30s, undertook the tremendous responsibility of assuming guardianship of five children,\nincluding one with special needs. She has devoted herself to their upbringing and well-\nbeing. She worked herself up from janitor to supervisor and, in the process, earned the\ntrust and praise of her employer. The downturn in real estate markets and the inability\nto sell the investment properties at issue were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. When her\nreal estate investments soured, she diligently worked toward negotiating a compromise\nwith her lenders, but to no avail. Other than her unresolved situation with regard to the\nmortgages, she is financially fit and has had no financial issues in close to a decade.\nSpeaking against Applicant, with regard to her mitigation of financial\nconsiderations security concerns, is the shear enormity of the sum for which Applicant\nis potentially liable.  While the sale or auction of the properties probably would not off-\n17\nset Applicant\u2019s obligation on the mortgages, it should reduce her liability. Ownership of\nthe homes, however, is now in the hands of the lenders and their plans regarding the\nproperties are unknown. As a result, there is no definite indication of what the total sum\nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt might be. Consequently, in carrying her burden in this\nproceeding, Applicant is presently left, through no fault of her own, in limbo as the\nlenders dawdle. Moreover, there is no evidence as to how she might address a debt as\nunwieldly as that which might emerge once the lenders have disposed of the property. \n\n7\nApplicant is a mature woman of admirable achievement whose investment,\nunfortunately, was dashed by recent downturns in the economy. Any doubts about an\nApplicant must be resolved in favor of national security. At least until a finite sum is\ndetermined regarding her liability, security concerns remain unmitigated. As previously\nnoted, the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that an\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines established for issuing a clearance. With\nsecurity concerns regarding her finances unmitigated and the extent of her liability thus\nfar unresolved, however, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 22, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated June 15, 2008.  On December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on a December 29, 2008, and he requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on February 23, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 26,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for March 17, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented five exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 through 5.  The Applicant\npresented seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, and called\none witness.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close\nof business on March 26, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation.  The Applicant submitted seven Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as 1\nthrough 7.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 24, 2009.  Based upon a\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 33 years old, married and has a Bachelors\nof Science Degree in Architecture.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior\nAnalyst and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated July 4, 2008, November 17, 2008, and\nFebruary 19, 2009, collectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.\nThese reports indicate that the Applicant is currently indebted to at least nine separate\ncreditors totaling approximately $ 140,000.00.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).  \nThe Applicant explained that in 2002, he decided to chase his dream to become\nan independent real estate developer.  He set his primary goal to build five luxury\nhomes before the age of thirty.  Although he was employed with a large company as an\nengineer, he quit his job to devote his full time effort to build his first home.  From July\n2004 to September 2006, he became wholly invested in this real estate project that was\nsupposed to be profitable for him, but was not.  Difficulties along the way caused the\nprofit margin to deplete.  Due to the unexpected downturn in the real estate business\nand delays caused by heavy rainy seasons, hillside slope problems requiring retaining\nwalls, and two public hearings for hauling routes, the property did not sell for what he\nhad expected.  The project took much longer to complete, actually two years.  At one\npoint, the house actually went into foreclosure, but the Applicant found a lender to bail\nhim out so that he could finish the house.  In January 2006, the Applicant put the house\non the market for 1.5 million dollars and it sold for 1.29 million.  Applicant was able to\npay off the morgages but was unable to pay off the excessive credit card debt he had\naccumulated to help finance some of the construction, building materials and lumber,\nwhen the lenders stopped financing the project.  (See Applicant Exhibit E and Applicant\nPost-Hearing Exhibit 7).    \nAs a result, the Applicant became indebted to each of the creditors set forth in\nthe SOR.  He is indebted to a bank for a delinquent credit card debt in the amount of\n$6,691.00; a debt to a creditor in the amount of $6,770.00; a debt to a creditor in the\n\n3\namount of $2,530.00; a debt to a bank for a delinquent credit card in the amount of\n$10,218.00; a debt for a deficiency judgment on a repossessed vehicle in the amount of\n$12,606.00; a debt to a jeweler in the amount of $3,748.00; and a gambling debt to a\nhotel/casino in Las Vegas in the amount of $10,000.00.  Applicant has not paid any of\nthese debts.  He states that he does plan to pay them as soon as he can afford to.  \n  \nDuring this same period, the Applicant foresaw other opportunities and\npurchased other property in the same area.  His goal was to either develop, remodel or\nrenovate the properties and then ultimately sell the real property for a profit.  (Applicant\nPost-Hearing Exhibits 4, 5 and 6).  One of these properties he still owns has no\nmortgage, but is encumbered by a tax lien.  Applicant expects to sell the property,\nsatisfy the lien, and be able to pay off all of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.\nThis property has been for sale now for about two years.  It has been in escrow twice\nbut the buyers could not perform.  Applicant has reduced the price to $175,000.00.\n(Applicant Exhibits C and D).  His wife also plans to get a job that will assist with the\nexpenses.     \nApplicant explained that in September 2006, he was unemployed for a while and\nthen worked part-time for a company and tried to maintain his credit card payments but\nwas unable to do so.  In July 2007, he and his wife got married and they moved out of\nstate.  (Applicant Exhibit F).  They both became employed out of state, but were unable\nto afford to pay the Applicant\u2019s outstanding delinquent credit card debt.  His wife then\ngot pregnant, quit her job, and they moved back to their home state.  The Applicant\nbecame employed with his current employer in June 2008. \n Recently, Applicant met with a debt counselor to obtain assistance in resolving\nhis delinquent debts.  After going over his monthly household expenses, the proposed\naction plan would place the Applicant in a negative $1,000.00 a month.  He stated that if\nhe were to try to follow the payment plan, he would not be able to survive.  (Tr. p. 26\nand Applicant Exhibit B).  Applicant testified that he has paid off four of his credit cards,\none of his wife\u2019s student loans, and is currently paying $1,000.00 a month toward his\nwife\u2019s credit card bills.  (Tr. pp. 55 and 59).  None of the credit card debt he asserts he\nhas paid is listed in the SOR.\n      \nIn August 2008, a state tax lien was placed against the Applicant in the amount\nof approximately $27,422.00.  Applicant has set up an automatic withdrawal monthly\ninstallment plan with the state tax authorities in the amount of $400.00 to resolve the\ndebt.  This payment plan has not yet started.  (Applicant Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).     \nIn April 2007, a federal tax lien was placed against the Applicant in the amount of\napproximately $65,426.00.  Applicant explained that in regard to his tax liability, his\nproblems began when he sold a piece of property (a vacant lot that he had previously\npurchased) and profited approximately $100,000.00.  His plan was to do a 1031\nexchange but it did not work out that way.  He now owes capital gains taxes or ordinary\nincome taxes.   His federal tax liability on the sale of the property is now $65,000.00 and\nis still accruing interest.      \nApplicant\u2019s Performance appraisal for the rating period from January 2008\nthrough December 2008 reflects \u201cexcellent\u2019 ratings in every category.  (Applicant Exhibit\n\n4\nA).  Applicant also received a bonus from his employer in February 2009, for\noutstanding  performance on the job.  (Applicant Post-Hearing Exhibit 3).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law testified that she has known the Applicant for at least\nfifteen years and that he has a strong work ethic, and is reliable and competent.  She is\ncurrently leasing her triplex to the Applicant and her daughter.  (Tr. p. 71-78).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n19(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling\nproblems, or other issues of security concern.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n\n5\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\n\n6\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nApplicant is indebted to nine separate creditors in the amount of approximately\n$140,000.00.  Circumstances beyond his control are partially responsible for his\nfinancial demise.  Namely, the downturn in the real estate market coupled with\nconstruction delays caused reduced profits from the sale that ultimately caused\nunexpected financial expenses.  Bad business decisions also contributed to his financial\ncrisis.  Since leaving the home building business, and since June 2008, when he started\nworking full time for his current employer, the Applicant has not paid any of the\ndelinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  He recently entered into a payment plan with\nstate tax authorities, but has not started paying off the debt.  His federal tax liability\ncontinues to accrue.  Although he plans on paying all of his debts when his property is\nsold, he has been unable to sell it, and the debts remain outstanding.  A promise to take\nremedial measures in the future is not evidence of reform and rehabilitation.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that he can even afford\nto make his regular monthly payments in addition to making payments on his delinquent\ndebts.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations and, 19(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism,\ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern apply.  Arguably, Mitigating\nCondition 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances also applies.  However, this mitigating condition is\noutweighed by the extent of the debt that remains outstanding, and Applicant\u2019s lack of\naction to resolve it.  His financial problems remain current and they are not isolated.  He\nhas not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve his debts.  Other than his favorable performance evaluation, and testimony from\n\n7\nhis mother-in-law as to his reliability and trustworthiness, the record is void as to any\nevidence in mitigation.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant executed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on April \n23, 2008. On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \nJanuary 14, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing.

I convened a hearing on November 4, 2009, to consider \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The government called no witnesses and introduced five \nexhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without \nobjection.

In both of his Answers to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all 13 allegations. The government conceded that the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. was a duplicate of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. The government also \nconceded that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. was factually the same debt that was \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j., thereby rendering SOR \u00b6 1.j. superfluous. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nof the debts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through 1.l., and 1.k. through 1.m. are \nadmitted herein as findings of fact. (Tr. 10-11.) \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. For approximately 1\u00bd years, he has been employed as \na security guard by a government contractor. He is a high school graduate. He has \npursued higher education and vocational training. He has taken courses to prepare \nhimself to work as a truck driver, massage therapist, locksmith, and personal trainer. He \nholds a state license in massage therapy. (Ex. 1; Tr. 31-32, 58, 64-70.) \n \n \nApplicant has 16 years and five months of active duty military service and over \n22 years of total military service. He currently serves in a National Guard unit.  Applicant \nwas first awarded a security clearance during his military service in 1993. He has not \nheld a security clearance since 2000. (Ex. 1; Tr. 30-31, 77-78.) \n \n \n  Applicant married in 1998, and he and his wife divorced in 2000. He has no \nbiological children. Applicant currently lives with a woman who has three children, and \nhe shares in the support of the household and the children. One of the children is a \nminor child and two of the children are young adults. (Ex. 1; Tr. 50-52, 58-59.) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. In about 2003, he signed a lease on \nan apartment for a woman with whom he had a relationship. The woman failed to pay \nthe required rent on the apartment, and Applicant was responsible for the rent \narrearages. Applicant was unable to pay the delinquent rent and his other debts, and in \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSeptember 2003, he filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. His delinquent consumer debts were \ndischarged by the bankruptcy court in January 2004.  Applicant\u2019s 2003 bankruptcy was \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Ex. 2 at 9-10; Tr. 35-36.) \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant also helped the same woman by co-signing her contract to \npurchase an automobile. When the relationship ended and Applicant moved out of the \napartment they shared, Applicant continued to send her money to use for her car \npayments. However, she failed to make the payments, the automobile was \nrepossessed, the account was placed for collection, and the creditor turned to Applicant \nfor payment of a debt of approximately $5,667. Applicant acknowledged responsibility \nfor the debt. He said he had made some payments on the debt, but he had no \ndocumentation to corroborate the payments. This debt is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b., and it \nremains unsatisfied.  (Ex. 2 at 15-16; Ex. 4 at 1; Ex. 5 at 11; Tr. 37-40.) \n \n \nApplicant purchased an automobile, and in 2006, the vehicle was repossessed \nwhen Applicant became delinquent in his payments. The creditor sold the account. A \nsuccessor creditor contacted Applicant on October 16, 2009, identified the amount \nApplicant owed as $11,471, and offered to settle the debt for $2,868, provided that \nApplicant accepted the settlement offer by November 20, 2009. At his hearing, \nApplicant said he did not have enough money to pay the offered settlement, and he \nplanned to contact the creditor to ask for an extension of time so that he could pay the \ndebt in the future. This debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d., and it remains unsatisfied. (Ex. \n2 at 3, 15; Ex.4; Ex. 5; Ex. D; Tr. 40-42.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.e. that Applicant owed a creditor $528 on an account \nthat was charged-off. Applicant admitted the debt. He stated that the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. was a federal tax debt that was paid with a tax refund from a later tax year. \nTo corroborate his assertion, he presented a document from the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury, dated May 29, 2009, stating that Applicant\u2019s federal tax refund of $877 had \nbeen intercepted and paid to satisfy a defaulted student loan debt. Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentation did not corroborate his assertion. (Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Ex. C; Tr. 42-43.)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f. that Applicant owed a state student loan association \n$7,150 on a collection account that had not been paid as of March 31, 2009.  Applicant \nadmitted the debt and presented a copy of a recent pay stub showing that a student \nloan creditor was garnishing $210 from his wages every two weeks to satisfy the \ndelinquency. He estimated that the garnishment, which was involuntary, began in \nOctober 2009. He did not know the identity of the student loan agency that had initiated \nthe garnishment. (Ex. B; Tr. 29-33, 43-44, 50.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.g. that Applicant owed a creditor $472 on a delinquent \naccount that had not been satisfied as of March 31, 2009. Applicant acknowledged the \ndebt and further identified it as a cell phone bill. Applicant was not sure that he had \nopened the account; however, he acknowledged that the debt had not been satisfied. \n(Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Tr. 44-46.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that Applicant owed a creditor $103 on a collection \naccount that had not been satisfied as of March 31, 2009. Applicant admitted the debt \nand explained that it was incurred when he enrolled at a school to study massage \ntherapy, attended classes for two weeks, and then dropped out after determining that he \ndid not need to continue to attend the school. He surmised that the $103 was an \nadministration fee charged by the school. He stated that he had not paid the fee but \nintended to do so in the future. (Ex. 4; E. 5; Tr. 47-48.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.i. that Applicant owed a state student loan agency \napproximately $535 on a delinquent debt that had been placed for collection and had \nnot been paid as of May 29, 2008. While Applicant admitted the debt, he wondered how \nhe had acquired it when he was attending school under the G I Bill. He also wondered if \nhe was the victim of identity theft. (Ex. 5; Tr. 47-48.)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was responsible for student loan delinquencies \nalleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.k., 1.l., and 1.m. These three debts totaled approximately $7,474. \nApplicant admitted the debts but did not know how he acquired them, even though they \nwere listed separately on his credit report of May 29, 2008, as was the student loan \ndelinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. He did not believe that the student loans alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.k., 1.l., and 1.m. duplicated the student loan delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nApplicant\u2019s Ex. E listed his student loan history and identified $2,773 in subsidized loans \nand $3,649 in unsubsidized loans. Applicant failed to establish that the debts alleged at \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k., 1.l., and 1.m. were not his. (Ex. 5; Ex. E at 5; Tr. 48-50.) \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent pay stub shows a net monthly salary of $2,375. He and \nhis girlfriend pay $1,315 a month for rent. They usually divide the rent payment, but \nbecause Applicant\u2019s girlfriend was out of work for four months recently, he paid the \nentire rent during those months. At the time of his hearing, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend had \nacquired employment and was able to pay her share of the monthly rent.  (Ex. B; Tr. 53-\n54.) \n \nOn the personal financial statement he provided in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in March 2009, Applicant identified fixed monthly expenses of $1,447. He \nalso reported that he paid $288 each month on three debts. Additionally, Applicant tries \nto send $100 to his mother and $100 to his grandmother each month. Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly fixed expenses, his monthly debt payments, and his payments to his mother \nand grandmother leave him with a net monthly remainder of $440. (Tr. 50-54.) \n \n Applicant was interviewed about his financial delinquencies by an authorized \ninvestigator on July 25, 2008. He told the investigator that he planned to dispute those \ndebts he could not recognize, and he said he planned to set up payment plans to \nresolve accounts he knew were his. He stated that he intended to satisfy all of his \ndelinquent debts. Applicant reported that he had consumer credit counseling at an \nunspecified time in the past. While Applicant provided a form letter showing that he was \nworking with a credit education service to dispute some of the debts listed on his credit \nreports, he failed to identify with specificity any debts that he had disputed. In the future, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhe plans to attend school on the GI Bill and use his stipend to pay some of his \ndelinquent debts. (Ex. A; Ex. 2 at 16; Tr. 55-58.)  \n \n                                               Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties date at least to his bankruptcy in 2003. In 2004, \nhis consumer debts were discharged by the bankruptcy court. Soon thereafter, he \nacquired additional delinquent debt when his automobile and his girlfriend\u2019s automobile \nwere repossessed and he was responsible for paying deficiencies resulting from the \nsale of the vehicles by the creditors. These debts remain unresolved. \n \nApplicant also incurred student loan debt, which he has not repaid voluntarily. \nOne of his federal tax refunds was intercepted by the Treasury Department to satisfy a \ndelinquent student loan debt. Recently, his wages were involuntarily garnished to satisfy \nanother delinquent student loan debt. Applicant has few resources available to him to \npay his financial delinquencies at this time. He hopes to pay his creditors in the future, \nbut his current financial situation casts doubt on his ability to plan realistically for the \nfuture.     \n \nApplicant stated he received financial counseling at some unspecified time in the \npast, but he did not seem to benefit from it. His financial problems, which began in the \npast, remain unresolved, even though he told an authorized investigator in July 2008 \nthat he intended to dispute or resolve all of his existing debts. He has not made good \nfaith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. While he admitted \nhis financial delinquencies, it was not clear that he understood his financial problems or \nhow to resolve them. He lacks a clear and realistic plan to systematically resolve his \nsubstantial delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that none of \nthe Financial Considerations mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 41 \nyears. He has served his country in the U.S. military for 22 years. He has sought to \nimprove his life through education. \n \nHowever, his financial problems date to at least 2003, when he was granted a \ndischarge in bankruptcy and thereby acquired a fresh start in his financial life. \nUnfortunately, he made choices that impaired his financial stability again. His lack of \nattention to his financial delinquencies and his failure to resolve them, even after stating \nthat he would do so, continues to raise security concerns about his judgment and \npotential financial vulnerability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I \nconclude, after a careful review of the facts of his case, the Financial Considerations \nadjudicative guideline, and the whole person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n           AGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.b.:             Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. - 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. - 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n                                    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The company provided him with a severance package. \nApplicant indicated that he did not recall the amount of the package, but it came to \n\u201cabout $50,000 after taxes and everything else.\u201d Applicant stated that some of the \nmoney went to dental work for the children, child support, and other expenses. \nApplicant\u2019s current job pays about $2,500 less per month than his job at the automotive \ncompany.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling about $68,391. The debts were \nlisted on credit reports obtained on July 12, 2008 and April 29, 2009. Applicant admitted \nto the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, and 1.n. He denied owing \nthe remaining debts. The total amount owed on the eight debts that Applicant admitted \nowing is about $53,502. He also admitted to SOR \u00b6 1.o, which alleged that his personal \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17, 48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE B-D. \n \n2 Tr. at 17-20, 36-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nfinancial statement, executed on January 5, 2009, reflected a negative monthly net \nremainder.3  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege delinquent debts of $327 and $164 to the same utility \ncompany, as collected by two different collection companies. Applicant admitted owing \nthe first debt and denied owing the second debt. There is insufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that these represent two distinct debts. When he responded to the SOR, \nApplicant stated that he sent the utility company a check for $327. At his hearing, \nApplicant admitted that he never sent the company a check. He stated that he made out \na check to the utility company for $327. When he called the company for an address, \nthe company told him that the debt was transferred to a collection company.4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege delinquent debts of $4,707 and $5,593 to the same \ncollection company. Applicant denied owing the debts because he stated that he did not \nrecognize the company. The debts are listed on the 2009 credit report but not the 2008 \nreport. The credit report does not list the original creditor(s). The $5,593 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e appears to be the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. There is insufficient \nevidence for a determination that the $4,707 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d represents a \ndistinct debt not alleged in another SOR allegation.5  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the delinquent debt of $1,058 owed to a collection \ncompany on behalf of an automobile tire company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He entered \na payment plan with the collection company in December 2008, in which he would settle \nthe debt with six monthly payments of $158. He made the first payment in January \n2009. He thought he made a second payment, but apparently it was sent to his credit \nmanagement company. He settled the debt through the credit management company \non August 31, 2009.6 \n \n \nApplicant \ninitially \ndenied \nowing \nthe \ndelinquent \ndebt \nof \n$128 \nto \na \ntelecommunications company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He contacted the collection \ncompany handling the debt after the hearing. He paid the debt with a $134 payment on \nAugust 21, 2009.7 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $1,262 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k because \nhe did not recognize the creditor. The SOR abbreviated the name of the creditor. When \nprovided the complete name of the creditor, Applicant admitted he had a delinquent \n                                                          \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n4 Tr. at 29-33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.

He listed the creditor under its full name when he \nsubmitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in July 2008.8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt of $3,035 owed to a financial institution. \nApplicant denied owing the debt because he did not recognize the company. The debt \nis listed on the 2008 credit report but not the 2009 report.9 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the remaining delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He \ncontracted with a credit management company to negotiate settlements on his behalf. \nHe stopped being actively involved with the company because their monthly payment \nschedule was too high. He has not received formal financial counseling, but he has \nreceived advice from friends. A friend provided him with literature from a well-known \nfinancial and credit advisor. Applicant indicated that he plans on paying all his debts, but \ndoes not have the income to do so at this time. His friends have recommended that he \nfile bankruptcy, but he does not believe that would be the morally right thing to do. He \nstated that he is saving $20 from his paycheck every two weeks to pay his debts. He \nplans on following the financial expert\u2019s advice, which is to pay the smallest debt first \nand then move to the next debt. He has recently reconnected with the credit \nmanagement company to negotiate settlements for his debts. Applicant\u2019s oldest child \nmarried in January 2009, which should eliminate child support for that child and lower \nhis total child support payments. He is in the process of petitioning the court to lower his \nchild support obligation. When that occurs, he will be able to put more funds toward his \ndelinquent debts. He is in somewhat better financial shape than when he submitted his \npersonal financial statement, but he admitted that his finances remain very tight.10 \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters from his supervisor and another pastor. The \nsupervisor attested to his superior job performance, honesty, work ethic, dedication, and \nintegrity. He recommended Applicant for a security clearance. The pastor has known \nApplicant his entire life. He stated Applicant is a man of character and integrity.11  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 40-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4. \n \n9 Tr. at 42-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n10 Tr. at 20-29, 42-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n11 AE A, D. \n\n \n5 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n6 \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved most of the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his ex-wife\u2019s mismanagement of \ntheir finances, his separation and divorce, and the loss of his job at the automotive \ncompany. These all qualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has made minimal payments on his delinquent debts. He \n\n \n7 \n \nreceived a severance package from the automotive company. He stated that he did not \nrecall the amount of the package, but it came to \u201cabout $50,000 after taxes and \neverything else.\u201d He did not fully explain what he did with that money. Without a better \naccounting of where those funds went, I am unable to make a finding that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has received some financial counseling, but there are not clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is \npartially applicable. He has paid several debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to those debts. \nThose payments do not support a finding that he made a good-faith effort to pay or \nresolve all his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to the unpaid debts. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.l. Three \nof the debts may be duplicates of other debts, and the fourth debt does not appear on \nthe most recent credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \n41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is also an ordained minister. He is \nhighly regarded personally and professionally. Between his long hours at the automotive \ncompany and as a pastor, he placed his finances in the hands of his wife. She \nmismanaged their finances, which he did not completely discover until after their \nseparation and divorce. The court ordered him to pay the marital debt and child support. \nHe was unable to keep up the payments on his child support, mortgage, and other bills. \nHe then lost his 20-year job at the automotive company because of downsizing. He \n\n \n8 \n \nmoved to another state and accepted a job making substantially less money. All these \nevents contributed to his financial problems. The automotive company gave him a \nseverance package that came to about $50,000 after taxes. He stated that some of the \nmoney went to dental work for the children, child support, and other expenses, but did \nnot provide any kind of breakdown as to how much was paid and to whom. He has \nmade minimal payments on his debts. Without a better accounting of the $50,000, I \ncannot find that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. I am also troubled \nby his inaccurate statement in his response to the SOR that he sent a creditor a check \nfor $327, when he had not. Accounting for the paid and disputed debts, Applicant still \nowes mores than $53,000 in delinquent debt. He stated that he can only afford to use \n$20 from his paycheck every two weeks for his delinquent debts. He remains financially \noverextended.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge ignored evidence\nfavorable to Applicant and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nThe Judge found that Applicant had several delinquent debts.  She acknowledged that\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems originated in a period of unemployment and from a marital breakup.\nHowever, she concluded that Applicant has not demonstrated a track record of financial\nresponsibility.  \u201cApplicant has experienced financial difficulties since at least 2005, but she has\naddressed them only recently.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was a mature adult,\nand she failed to address her delinquent debts for a significant period, a decision that raises concerns\nabout her judgment and reliability.\u201d  Decision at 7.\nApplicant contends on appeal that the Judge either ignored or mis-weighed significant record\nevidence, including the circumstances under which she first experienced her financial problems, the\nextent to which she has paid off debts, and her development of a debt management plan.  However,\na Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-\n00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  In\nany event, the Judge\u2019s decision demonstrates that she considered the evidence favorable to\nApplicant, but that she plausibly explained why she concluded that Applicant had, nevertheless,\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns in her case.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant has sole custody of her son, and her former husband pays her $505 a month in child support. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Tr. 24-25, 47-48.)

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n_______________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on June 6, 2008. On May 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 13, \nNovember 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 21, 2009. On September 9, 2009, I \nconvened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through Ex. 4 and admitted without objection. The Government offered \none demonstrative exhibit which showed where each of the debts alleged on the SOR \ncould be found on the two credit reports admitted as Ex. 3 and Ex. 4. The Government\u2019s \ndemonstrative exhibit was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 and admitted without \nobjection. \n \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and called one witness. She introduced 13 \nexhibits, which were marked as Ex. A through Ex. M and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on September 14, 2009.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 17 allegations which raised security concerns under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q.) In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted 13 allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.f. through 1.m., 1.o., and \n1.q.). The debts that Applicant admitted totaled approximately $17,000. She denied the \nfour allegations of delinquent debt at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.e., 1.n., and 1.p. The debts that \nApplicant denied totaled approximately $2,390. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included \nherein as findings of fact.  (Applicant Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old, divorced, and the parent of a 14-year-old son. \nApplicant has sole custody of her son, and her former husband pays her $505 a month \nin child support. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Tr. 24-25, 47-48.) \n \n \nApplicant has completed approximately three years of college studies. She is \nemployed by a government contractor as a document management specialist. She has \nworked for her current employer for approximately 1\u00bd years. She has also worked as a \nsubstitute teacher and personal trainer. She was first awarded a security clearance in \n1981. (Ex. 1; Tr. 24, 48-52, 75, 82.) \n \n \nApplicant and her former husband separated in 2001 and divorced in 2004. She \nwas employed by another federal contractor between August 2001 and July 2005. In \nJuly 2005, she lost her job. Between July 2005 and acquiring her present employment \nin April 2008, Applicant worked at a variety of temporary jobs. During her periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, Applicant began to fall behind in paying her \ndebts, and she continues to have financial difficulties.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 22-23.) \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant purchased an automobile for $25,000. The automobile was \nrepossessed in March 2008. As of May 14, 2009, Applicant owed the creditor $14,000 \non the delinquent automobile debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.j.; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 69-70.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn 2005, approximately two weeks before she lost her job, Applicant met a man \nwith whom she established a romantic relationship. Applicant considers the man to be \nher \u201csignificant other,\u201d and he appeared as a witness at her hearing. He stated that he \nhad provided Applicant with approximately $30,000 in financial assistance, on an as-\nneeded basis, from 2005 to the present. Sometimes he gave her money to pay her rent; \nsometimes he provided money for her car payments or other expenses. He continued to \nprovide her with financial assistance after she obtained her present job in April 2008. He \ndid not expect repayment from Applicant. Applicant provided photocopies of checks that \nshe had received from her significant other. The most recent check for $350 was dated \nJuly 30, 2009. (Ex. I; Tr. 45, 76-77, 90-95.) \n \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant contracted with a debt management group to pay \nsome of her delinquent debts. The delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.h., \n1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.m. were listed on Applicant\u2019s payment plan. She provided \ndocumentation to establish that for eight months she made payments of $437 to reduce \nor satisfy her debts. She provided documentation to establish that the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. had been satisfied. (Ex. G; Ex. H; Tr. 53-54.) \n \n \nApplicant owed three debts to a communication company. These debts were \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g., 1.n., and 1.p.  In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g., and she acknowledged that it had not been paid. She \ndenied the debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.n. and 1.p., which are listed on her credit report. She \nfailed to provide documentation to establish that she did not owe the debts. (Answer to \nSOR; Tr. 65-68.) \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged that she had not paid the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c. and 1.d. She stated that she intended to dispute the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. She \nstated she had placed the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. in her debt payment program. \nHowever, the debt was not listed in the debt management payment materials she \nprovided.  (Ex. G; Ex. H; Tr. 57-60, 61-64.) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation to establish that she had satisfied the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.o. (Ex. D.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income from her employer is $3,000. She also receives \n$505 each month in child support. Her fixed monthly expenses are $2,616. She pays \n$437 a month on her consolidated debt payment plan. She also pays an additional $42 \na month on a personal debt. She has $10 in her savings account, and she estimated \nthat she had $6,000 in her retirement account. She has a net monthly remainder of \n$410.1 (Tr. 75-82.) \n \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement of February 23, 2009, showed a net monthly remainder of \n$1.46. This low monthly remainder was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.q., and Applicant admitted the allegation. \nHowever, the Personal Financial Statement contained arithmetic errors that did not favor Applicant, and \nshe provided additional information at her hearing that supported a higher monthly remainder amount. \n(Ex. 2 at 12; Tr. 74-84.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant provided certificates of training, a newsletter excerpt praising her for \ngood service to customers, and a recent performance review. The performance review \nshowed that her employer values her hard work, good judgment, and dependability. (Ex. \nJ; Ex. K; Ex. L; Ex. M.)  \n \n \nApplicant reported she had attended some financial counseling offered by her \nbank for individuals who wish to purchase homes. (Tr. 79-80.) \n \n                                                             Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG & \n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns.  \n \nApplicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to pay her \ncreditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the \nfinancially delinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might \napply.  If \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies began several years \nago and continue to this day. Applicant\u2019s current financial delinquencies involve \nsubstantial sums of money in proportion to her income and resources, occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur, and cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nApplicant was divorced in 2004 and lost her job in 2005. Between 2005 and early \n2008, she searched for another job and accepted temporary employment. Her \nsignificant other provided her with approximately $30,000 in financial assistance. The \nrecord does not include facts that suggest protracted conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol that would explain her failure over a period of years to meet her financial \nobligations. While she experienced unemployment in the past, she has been steadily \nemployed with her current employer for the past 1\u00bd years.  \n \nTo her credit, Applicant sought to consolidate her debts, and, since February \n2009, she has made eight monthly payments to reduce her debts through a debt \nconsolidation and management program. She provided documentation to establish that \ntwo of the debts alleged on the SOR have been satisfied. However, she is also \nresponsible for several other debts that remain unresolved. She remains dependent \nupon her significant other for financial support, and she does not have a plan in place \nfor avoid financial overextension in the future. While Applicant\u2019s intention to satisfy her \ncreditors in the future is laudable, it is too soon to conclude that she has demonstrated a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. She has not yet demonstrated that she will repay \nher creditors and avoid financial delinquencies in the future. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(c), and 20(e) do not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. I also conclude that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply in part to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In her current position, \nApplicant is respected and appreciated for her professionalism and hard work. She is a \nreliable employee. She has been steadily employed with her current employer for 1\u00bd \nyears.  \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties since at least 2005, but she has \naddressed them only recently. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was a \nmature adult, and she failed to address her delinquent debts for a significant period, a \ndecision that raises concerns about her judgment and reliability. To her credit, she \nentered a debt consolidation and management program in February 2009, and she has \nmade regular payments since then on some of her debts. However, she has failed to \nsatisfy other debts and continues to rely upon her significant other for financial \nassistance. It is not clear at this time that she will accept responsibility for managing her \nown financial problems and satisfying her creditors.  \n \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this \ndecision becomes final. At that time, if she wishes, she can produce new evidence that \naddresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n           Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h. through 1.m.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

From April 2005 until May 2006, Applicant was unemployed or worked at temporary jobs without benefits. During that time, Applicant incurred significant medical debt for which she did not have insurance. Applicant also has significant delinquent credit card debt, some of which accrued while she was working before April 2005. Applicant blames some of her debt on the fact that she was a single parent raising three children. Her children are now all grown and living elsewhere. Applicant has made arrangements to pay off a series of delinquent medical bills and has been making payments on them since August 2009; she has not contacted other creditors to whom she owes larger amounts of money that have been reduced to judgments. Although Applicant was aware of at least one judgment and one credit card debt, she did not list any debts in her responses to financial questions on her security clearance application. Applicant has consulted an attorney about filing for bankruptcy. Applicant is highly regarded by her co-workers and her supervisors. In her brief, Applicant points out steps she has taken since her hearing to improve her financial situation. The Board is not able to consider that information, since it constitutes new evidence.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 6, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 23, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge considered or gave\nadequate weight to her evidence of mitigation and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Since May 2006, Applicant has\nworked for a Defense contractor as a security guard.

There is a\nrebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, and there is no requirement\nthat the Judge mention or discuss every piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).   The Judge explained why he concluded\nthat the omissions from Applicant\u2019s security clearance application were deliberate.  Applicant had\nthe burden to extenuate or mitigate  the security concerns raised by those omissions.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s explanation and denials.  However, the Judge explained\nwhy Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by the\nomissions.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does\nnot turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\n\n3\nsecurity clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A\nparty\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence\nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 08-03845 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009).\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn March 11, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for her work\nfor a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of and/or additional\n1\ninformation about potentially disqualifying information in her background. After reviewing\nthe results of the background investigation, as well as Applicant\u2019s response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nMarch 23, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised adjudicative guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised adjudicative guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed\nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow him access to\n2\nclassified information. On July 6, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if established, raise security concerns addressed\nin the revised adjudicative guidelines  under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\n3\nGuideline E (personal conduct).\nOn July 29, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on September 1, 2009, and I convened a hearing on\nNovember 20, 2009. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented\nfive exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 5.\nApplicant and one witness testified on her behalf. She also presented 14 documents\nthat were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - N. The record\nremained open after the hearing to give Applicant time to submit additional relevant\ninformation. The record closed on December 3, 2009, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission. It has been admitted into the record without objection as Ax. O.\nDOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on December 4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately\n$14,453 for 18 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.r) that, as of April 14, 2009, remained\nunpaid. In her July 29, 2009, response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.k, 1.n - 1.r, but denied the others. \nThe government also alleged, under Guideline E, that in response to e-QIP\nquestion 27, she deliberately omitted that she owed a $1,346 judgment, also alleged at\nSOR \u00b6 1.g (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that in response to e-QIP question 28.a and 28.b, she\ndeliberately omitted the other 17 debts alleged in the SOR (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant did\nnot respond to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b when she responded to the SOR\nin July 2009. However, at the hearing, I asked Applicant for her response to these\nallegations. Based on her comments and on her responses to my questions, I entered\ndenials for her in response to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. In addition to the facts established\nthrough her admissions to allegations about her finances, I have made the following\nfindings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 43 years old. Since May 2006, she has worked as a security guard\nfor a defense contractor. Applicant has three children ages 26, 25, and 19. Until late\n2009, at least one of her children and a grandchild lived with her, and she provided\nmost of their support. All of her children are now on their own. She has been married\ntwice. Her first marriage began in 1987 and ended through divorce in 1993. Her\n\n It is unknown why the government did not include this debt in the SOR.\n4\n3\nyoungest child was born of that marriage, but she has received only sporadic child\nsupport payments from the child\u2019s father. She re-married in 1994, but again divorced in\n2003. (Gx. 1; Tr. 75 - 76)\nBetween April 2005 and May 2006, Applicant was either unemployed or she\nfound work through temporary agencies who did not provide her any benefits. In 2005\nand 2006, Applicant went to the emergency room and was admitted to the hospital\nseveral times for heart palpitations and anxiety attacks. She eventually received the\nproper medications and her health has been fine for the past three years. (Tr. 72 - 74)\nHowever, at the time she required this medical treatment she had no health insurance.\nShe was also a single mother still responsible for supporting her daughter and\ngrandchild. (Tr. 54 - 56) As a result, she incurred more than $14,000 in unpaid medical\nbills. About $5,200 was alleged in the SOR, but she also owes another $9,000 for a\njudgement obtained by a hospital against her. (Gx. 3)  \n4\nApplicant also incurred another $9,200 in unpaid credit cards and other accounts.\nHowever, much of this debt arose before she had her medical problems, but when she\nwas working in another state. She explained that as a single mother working shifts, she\nalso had to pay child care and had to use credit cards to make ends meet. (Tr. 57 - 58)\nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l, Applicant owes CapOne bank about $3,000 for\ndelinquent credit cards. She was aware of this delinquency as early as 2005, and she\ntried to reach a settlement agreement with that creditor to no avail. (Tr. 57) In 2004,\nApplicant defaulted on a bank loan. The bank obtained a civil judgment against her for\n$1,346. She knew at the time that she was being sued for the defaulted loan. (Tr. 65).\nApplicant has also tried to resolve her debts through credit counseling or debt\nconsolidation and repayment  companies. However, she could not afford the\nrecommended monthly payments and it was recommended that she file for bankruptcy.\n(Tr. 62)\nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP in March 2008, she was aware that she\nowed at least one unpaid judgment and the CapOne credit card delinquency, all of\nwhich she had incurred within the previous seven years. However, she did not list any of\nher past due debts in response to any of the e-QIP questions regarding her finances.\n(Gx. 1) When asked why she omitted her debts, she testified that, because she had not\nlooked at a recent credit report, she was unsure what to list. (Tr. 68 - 69)\nSince August 2009, Applicant has been making what payments she can on\nseveral of her debts. She has reached an agreement with four of her medical creditors\nto have between $30 and $50 taken directly from her bank account each month.\nHowever, she has not paid or otherwise resolved the larger debts that are the subject of\nthe civil judgments against her. The debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.m and 1.o have\nbeen paid. (Answer to SOR; Ax. B; Ax. D; Gx. 3) Her monthly finances reflect that she\nhas about $200 remaining each month after paying all of her expenses and making the\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n4\ndebt payments directly from her bank account. (Gx. 2; Tr. 69 - 71) In March 2009, she\nconsulted a bankruptcy attorney about possibly filing for Chapter 7 liquidation; however,\nas of the hearing she had not yet filed.\nApplicant enjoys a solid personal reputation among her coworkers and friends.\nHer immediate supervisor recommended she be given a clearance based on his daily\nobservation of her excellent work performance. Others have praised her generosity and\ngood character. (Ax. A) Her manager also testified that Applicant is one of her best\nemployees. (Tr. 48 - 53)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18, Guideline F (financial considerations) and AG \u00b6 15, Guideline E (personal\nconduct) .\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must prove\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\npersuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n7\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a - 1.r; that is, that Applicant accrued almost $14,453 in delinquent personal debt\nbeginning around 2003, when she defaulted on her CapOne credit card account. Since\nthen, she has had at least two civil judgments (only one of which was included in the\nSOR) entered against her and she has been unable to pay several medical bills she\nincurred in 2005 and 2006. Applicant established that she has paid the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a, 1.f, 1.m and 1.o, which total about $2,111. Accordingly, those allegations are\nresolved for Applicant. Nonetheless, the record supports those allegations and requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). As to AG\n\u00b6 19(a), the facts reflect an inability rather than an unwillingness to pay, as shown by\nher modest monthly payments to at least four of her unpaid accounts. \nBy contrast, available information shows that Applicant has incurred her\ndelinquent debts as a result of several years of sporadic employment, being\nunemployed for most of 2005, a divorce in 2003 that left her as the sole provider for two\nof her children who were still living with her, and unforeseen medical expenses in 2005\nand 2006 while she did not have medical insurance. Applicant has not engaged in any\ntangible financial counseling, but she has managed to reach agreements with some of\n\n6\nher creditors to make modest payments, but this approach will not result in any\nsignificant resolution of her debts for several years. She has not yet begun to resolve\nher larger debts, including the two large debts being enforced through civil judgments\nagainst her. Available information supports consideration of the mitigating conditions at\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant is not expected to be completely debt free. Indeed, given her modest\nmeans and the events that have either caused her debts or hindered her ability to pay\nthem, it is not surprising that most her debt remains unpaid. I recognize that such\nevents were not caused by Applicant, and that she is paying what she can, but at some\npoint an individual\u2019s circumstances pose an unacceptable risk when deciding whether to\nallow that person access to classified information. Such is the case here. I conclude that\nthe security concerns about her unpaid debts are not mitigated.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe government alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) that Applicant deliberately falsified\nher answers to two questions in her e-QIP that asked her to disclose if she had any\nunpaid judgments or if she had any debts more than 180 or 90 days past due. The\nsecurity concern raised by these allegations, as stated at AG \u00b6 15, is that:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe Applicant denied both allegations, thereby placing on the government the burden of\n\u201cpresenting witnesses and other information to establish facts that have been\ncontroverted.\u201d (Directive, E3.1.14) \nAside from the e-QIP (Gx. 1) that shows she did not list any past-due debts,\nthere is no information that directly shows that Applicant intentionally provided false\nanswers as alleged. However, the totality of available information supports a conclusion\nthat she did so. Applicant specifically knew that she had been sued by the creditor\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and that she was delinquent on her CapOne account as early as\n2005. It can also be reasonably inferred that she knew when she completed her e-QIP\nthat she was at least 90 days past due on her medical bills. In light of all of the\ninformation about her debts, and without any other information (that she has not\nprovided) to explain why she answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions at issue, Applicant\u2019s claim\nthat she did not disclose any of her debts because she had not seen a credit report is\ninsufficient. Based on all of the foregoing, I conclude that the disqualifying condition at\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n7\nAG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies. At the very least, she could have answered \u201cyes\u201d to any one of\nthe questions about her finances, thereby putting the government on notice that her\nfinances might be a concern.\nBy contrast, Applicant presented no information that shows she tried to correct\nher omission before the hearing, or that her answers were given according to erroneous\nadvice from an otherwise qualified source. Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at AG\n\u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(b) (the\nrefusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal\ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security\nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide\nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully) do not apply. \nI have also considered the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant\u2019s falsification\nappears to be an isolated event, and it is unlikely that Applicant would again withhold\nsuch information from the government. However, her explanations of why she answered\nthe questions as she did leave me with doubts about her candor and her judgment.\nTherefore, I conclude she has failed to mitigate the security concerns about her\npersonal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record in the context of\nthe whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 43 years old and presumed to\nbe a mature, responsible adult. According to her two supervisors and several other\nreferences, she is a generous, hardworking person who has done her best to meet her\nfamily obligations despite difficult circumstances. However, the positive information\nabout Applicant is insufficient to overcome the adverse information about her debts and\nfalsifications. A fair, commonsense  evaluation of this record shows that concerns\n9\nremain about Applicant\u2019s finances and her trustworthiness, thus perpetuating the doubts\nraised by the government\u2019s information about her ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved for the government.10\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g - 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.p - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) on \nMay 2, 2008. On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \nJuly 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 16, 2009, and he requested a decision on \nthe record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on May 6, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through \n8.  By letter dated May 7, 2008, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with \ninstructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of \nreceipt.  Applicant received the file on May 13, 2009. His response was due on June 12, \n2009. He submitted additional information within the required time period. On June 29, \n2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of financial delinquency under AG \u00b6 18, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all four of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency and \nprovided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as findings of \nfact.  (Item 1; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old, married, and employed full-time by a government \ncontractor. In 2003, he started a small communications business, which he operated in \nhis free time. Because of an economic slowdown, he decided to close the business at \nthe end of 2008. He has not previously held a security clearance.  (Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about his \nfinancial situation. He reported a total net monthly household income of $4,305, which \nincluded $2,200 from his job as a government contractor, his wife\u2019s net monthly income \nof $1,142, and $963 from his communications business.1 His total monthly expenses \nwere $2,295. Additionally, he reported a first mortgage monthly payment of $1,212, a \nsecond mortgage monthly payment of $374, and a monthly payment of $140 on a \nclosed credit card account which totaled $5,010. His monthly net remainder was $284. \n(Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s assets include $264,000 in real estate, $3,133 in a 401K plan, and \ntwo automobiles valued at $8,350.  (Item 5.) \n \n \nThe delinquent debts, alleged in the SOR and admitted by Applicant, total \napproximately $23,270. In 1997, Applicant opened an account with the creditor \nidentified at SOR \u00b6 1.b. The account was charged-off in January 2009.  With his answer \nto the SOR, Applicant provided documentation, dated April 7, 2009, to corroborate his \nstatement that he had settled the debt of $6,398 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item 1; Item 3 at  \n2; Item 7.) \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s statement that he was closing his communications business in December 2008, suggests \nthat this source of monthly income would then end. (Item 5 at 5.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant denied being more than 30 days past due on the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.c., and he asserted that he would be current on the debt as of May 1, 2009. He also \nprovided documentation, dated April 7, 2009, from the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.c \nwhich stated that he had not been over 60 days past due on his debt to that creditor \nsince December 2007. (Item 1; Item 3 at 1, 3.) \n \n \nWith his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had telephoned the creditor \nidentified at SOR \u00b6 1.a. and was attempting to resolve the debt, which totaled \napproximately $16,128. His credit reports for July 15, 2008 and February 12, 2009, \nshowed that the account had been opened in 2003, reported delinquent in 2008, and \ncharged off and closed by the creditor in February 2009. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant provided documentation showing that the debt had grown to $16,687. He also \nprovided a document showing that he had entered into a payment plan with the creditor \nand had made one payment of $300 in May 2009. (Item 3; Item 7; Item 8; Response to \nFORM.) \n \n \nApplicant offered documentation to establish that on March 5, 2009, his credit \ncard had been charged to satisfy the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. Department Counsel \nfound Applicant\u2019s assertion that the credit card payment satisfied the debt unpersuasive \nbecause the account number on the satisfaction letter did not match the account \nnumber identified for the account on Applicant\u2019s July 15, 2008 credit report. In his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant provided a document corroborating his statement that \nthe debt had been satisfied in full on April 15, 2009.  (Item 3 at 4; FORM at 3; Response \nto FORM at 1, 3-5.) \n \n   \n \nThe record does not reflect that Applicant has received financial counseling. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. For a period of several years, Applicant accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions could apply to Applicant\u2019s case. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d the AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial delinquencies. He did not take \naction to resolve three of his financial delinquencies until after he received the SOR, \nsuggesting inattentiveness, lack of sufficient resources to pay his delinquent debts, or a \nlack of good faith in dealing with his creditors. \n \nIn his financial statement, he indicated he was closing his communications \nbusiness in December 2008, an action which would decrease his monthly income by \napproximately $963. He reported in his response to the FORM that he had negotiated a \npayment plan with the creditor to whom he owes over $16,000, and he had made an \ninitial monthly payment of $300 on the debt. His financial statement, however, reflects a \nmonthly remainder of $284, before deducting $963 in monthly income lost when he \nclosed his business. This raises a concern that Applicant lacks the financial resources \nto follow through with the payment plan he negotiated with the creditor identified in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financially delinquent behavior happened in the past. However, the \ndelinquencies occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. Applicant appears \nto lack sufficient resources to pay or settle his delinquent debt of over $16,000. The \nrecord does not reflect that the circumstances that gave rise to his delinquencies were \nbeyond his control. Applicant has not sought consumer credit counseling. I conclude \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not mitigate the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his or her \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. To his \ncredit, after being put on notice by DOHA of his financial delinquencies, he made an \neffort to settle or resolve them. It is not clear that he has sufficient monthly resources to \nsustain the $300 a month commitment he has made to resolve his $16,000 delinquent \ndebt. His promise to resolve a debt when he appears to lack sufficient funds to do so \nraises security concerns about his judgment and reliability. He has not established a \nreliable track record of timely and consistent payment of his debts over time. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies. Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the \ndate that this decision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that \naddresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n           Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.d.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to Guidelines B and E and as to three of the allegations under\n1\nGuideline F.  Therefore, only the remaining allegations under Guideline F are in issue in this appeal.\n2\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nSeptember 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.   Specifically, Applicant objects to two statements made by the Judge.\n1\nApplicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s decision should be reversed because Applicant successfully\nmitigated all the government\u2019s security concerns and because an adverse security clearance decision\nwill have a negative impact on Applicant\u2019s financial situation and his employment prospects.\nFinding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: While in college and working only\npart-time, Applicant accumulated a considerable amount of credit card debt and fell behind in his\npayments.  Applicant was able to address most of those debts when he obtained full-time\nemployment after graduation, although he also accrued new debt, which he was able to repay from\nhis full-time salary.  Upon switching to part-time employment to attend graduate school in 2001,\nApplicant again accumulated substantial credit card debt and fell behind on that debt.  When\nApplicant began working full-time again in 2003, he began to address his old debts, but he did not\nearn enough money to repay them.  The old debts became delinquent, and additional interest and\npenalties accrued.  Applicant worked full-time between 2003 and 2006.  During that time, Applicant\nrealized that his debts had become too large for him to repay.  Applicant left his full-time job in 2006\nbecause it did not satisfy his expectations.  Between 2006 and 2008, Applicant worked at small jobs\nand could not address his old debts.  Applicant reached a settlement agreement regarding the largest\ndebt in the SOR and documented payment of the first installment toward that agreement.  At the time\nof the hearing, Applicant had not been able reach settlement agreements with the next two largest\ncreditors.  The Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding three debts in the SOR that were\nduplicates.  Applicant did not document payment of the other debts.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nIn his appeal, Applicant discusses steps he has taken to improve his financial situation, and\nhe includes documentation for payments made after the closing of the record.  Any remedial steps\ntaken and any payments made after the close of the record constitute new evidence, which the Board\n\nThe Judge found that two other debts were duplicates of other debts in the SOR, but the amounts of those debts\n2\nwere small.\n3\ncannot consider on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The failure to consider such new evidence does\nnot demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00184 at 2 (App. Bd.\nOct. 9, 2007).\nApplicant contests two statements in the Judge\u2019s decision.  Regarding the first, Applicant\nnotes that  the Judge correctly found in his favor as to SOR paragraph 1.a because paragraphs 1.a and\n1.h represent the same debt.  However, in the \u201cSummary of Pleadings\u201d section of his decision, the\nJudge did not subtract the duplicate amount from the total owed by Applicant.   Decision at 2.  In\n2\nthe \u201cSummary of Pleadings,\u201d the Judge was summarizing the SOR allegations.  Later in the decision,\nthe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to a number of the allegations.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s\nstatement cited by Applicant is not erroneous.  \nAs to the other statement noted by Applicant, the Judge referenced Applicant\u2019s monthly\nincome and expenses and the resulting remainder.  Decision at 8.  Applicant indicates that, as of the\ntime of the hearing, his monthly remainder had increased significantly.  As Applicant points out, the\nfigures stated by the Judge came from information Applicant provided in December 2008.  If\nApplicant wished the Judge to consider that his monthly remainder had increased by the time of the\nhearing on June 29, 2009, Applicant could have provided that information at the hearing and in fact\nhad the burden to do so.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The record supports the Judge\u2019s statement in this\nregard.\nApplicant also contends that he satisfied the government\u2019s security concerns and that the\nJudge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (May 23, 2008).\nFinally, Applicant indicates that an adverse security clearance decision will have a negative\nimpact on his financial situation and his employment prospects, stating that he lost the job he held\nat the time of the hearing and that he has found another job, but the offer is contingent on his having\na security clearance.  The possible effect a security clearance decision could have on an applicant\u2019s\neconomic situation is not relevant or material to whether a Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10079 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2009).  See also ISCR\nCase No. 08-00899 at n.1 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008).  \u201cThe adverse impact of a clearance decision on\nan applicant is not relevant or material to an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.\u201d  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\n\n4\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision\nat 17.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general standard\nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity\u2019\u201d). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born in Nigeria in 1978 to parents of Nigerian heritage. He immigrated to the U.S. in July 1994 on a business visa to pursue his college education (see ex. 8; Tr. 101). Records show he attended recognized universities of higher learning between 1995 and 2003. Once in the U.S., he switched to an L1 work visa, and later to permanent residence status (ex. 8). Applicant earned a B.S. degree in computer science in 1999 and an M.S. degree in information security in 2003 (see ex. 1). After obtaining permanent residence status in 1998, Applicant applied for U.S. citizenship (see ex. 8). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2004 (see ex. 1; Tr., 101-02, 105). However, he did not renounce his Nigerian citizenship, and is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria. He maintained his dual citizenship and Nigerian passport for ease of travel purposes when visiting his family members in Nigeria. Applicant traveled to Nigeria in December 2005 to marry his current wife. His spouse, in turn, remained in Nigeria for a couple of years, pending her application for a work permit in the U.S. (Tr. 104-05).

The\ncase was assigned to me on June 17, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on June 29,\n2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering whether\nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of nine\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and 11 exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.)\nwas received on July 8, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access classified information is denied.\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2\n Besides its nine exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of\nseven documents: Background Note: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (April 2009);\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues\n(January 2008); Country Specific Information, Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (April\n2009); 2008 Human Rights Report: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (February 2009);\nTravel Warning: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (December 2008); Warden Message,\nU.S. Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria (March 2009); and Warden Message, U.S. Diplomatic\nMission to Nigeria (April 2009).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).  Administrative notice is appropriate\nfor noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Nigeria.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Nigeria\u2019s current status.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant (a) incurred three adverse\njudgments against him that exceed $18,000 and (b) accumulated seven debts exceeding\n$7,000.\nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges that Applicant: (a) has a spouse who is a\ncitizen of Nigeria; (b) has a mother and two brothers who are dual citizens of the U.S.\nand Nigeria; (c) has a father who is a citizen of Nigeria, and resides in both the U.S. and\nNigeria; (d) has a father who previously served as a contractor to the Nigerian\ngovernment; (e) has two sisters who are citizens of Nigeria; (f) has parents in-law who\nare citizens of and reside in Nigeria; (g) resided and worked in Nigeria between\nDecember 2006 and July 2007; (h) traveled to Nigeria in or about December 2000,\nDecember 2001, July 2002, December 2002, and December 2005; and (I) maintains a\nsavings account in Nigeria.\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified the security clearance\napplication he completed in January 2008, when he failed to disclose (a) his possession\nof an active Nigerian passport that was issued in January 2001 and was due to expire in\nDecember 2010 and (b) his arrest in May 2006 for failure to appear on a traffic-related\noffense. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, but denied\ngenerally being financially overextended, being at risk of foreign influence by virtue of his\nhaving family members (both immediate and extended) in Nigeria, his keeping a small\n\n3\nbank account in Nigeria, his traveling to Nigeria between December 2000 and December\n2005, or by falsifying his e-QIP. \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant asked to leave the record open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record to explore the history of his listed\njudgments (creditors 1.a through 1.c) and to try to address them.  For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record with information\npertaining to his three outstanding judgments and how he intends to address them. The\nGovernment was afforded three days to respond.   Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with seven exhibits. The Government interposed no objections,\nand Applicant\u2019s submissions are accepted as exhibits L through Q    \nApplicant made a supplement request in July 2009 to open the record to permit\nhim to submit an agreed settlement of his creditor 1.a judgment debt.  There being no\nobjection from Department Counsel, and for good cause shown, Appellant was granted\nleave to supplement the record with his settlement agreement and a copy of his first\npayment installment under the terms of the agreement. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing\nsubmission is accepted as exhibit R.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in Nigeria in 1978 to parents of Nigerian heritage.  He\nimmigrated to the U.S. in July 1994 on a business visa to pursue his college education\n(see ex. 8; Tr. 101).  Records show he attended recognized universities of higher\nlearning between 1995 and 2003.  Once in the U.S., he switched to an L1 work visa, and\nlater to permanent residence status (ex. 8).  Applicant earned a B.S. degree in computer\nscience in 1999 and an M.S. degree in information security in 2003 (see ex. 1). \nAfter obtaining permanent residence status in 1998, Applicant applied for U.S.\ncitizenship (see ex. 8).   He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2004 (see ex. 1;\nTr., 101-02, 105).  However, he did not renounce his Nigerian citizenship, and is a dual\ncitizen of the U.S. and Nigeria.  He maintained his dual citizenship and Nigerian passport\nfor ease of travel purposes when visiting his family members in Nigeria. \nApplicant traveled to Nigeria in December 2005 to marry his current wife.  His\nspouse, in turn, remained in Nigeria for a couple of years, pending her application for a\nwork permit in the U.S. (Tr. 104-05).  Applicant returned to Nigeria in December 2006 to\nbe with his wife who was pregnant at the time and did not have a visa to join him in the\n\n4\nU.S. (Tr., at 105).  In July 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife obtained her visa, entitling her to enter\nthe U.S. (Tr., at 102).  Shortly thereafter (in July 2007), Applicant returned to the U.S.,\nthis time with his wife.  Upon her arrival in the U.S., she applied for permanent residence\nstatus. She was granted permanent residence status in May 2008 (see ex. F; Tr. 102),\nand will apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible. \nApplicant has two children by his wife (Tr. 102).  His first child was born in the\nU.S. in July 2007  (Tr. 102-03), and is a U.S. citizen by birth.  His wife gave birth to a\nsecond child this year (Tr.112)\nBetween December 2000 and December 2005, Applicant traveled to Nigeria on\nsix separate occasions to see his wife and family: in December 2000, December 2001,\nJuly 2002, December 2002, December 2005, and December 2006 (see exs. 1 and 8).\nOn all but two of his trips, he used his U.S. passport for entry in and exit from  Nigeria\n(see ex. 8).  He recollects using his Nigerian passport to travel to Nigeria before he\nbecame a U.S. citizen, and twice for the same purpose since becoming a U.S. citizen:\nonce in 2005 and once in 2006 (see ex. 8).  Applicant documents obtaining his U.S.\npassport in December 2004, and surrendering his Nigerian passport (issued in 2001 and\ndue to expire in January 2010) to his facility security officer (FSO) in September 2008\n(see exs. 8, 9, and I; Tr. 124-25). \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents are Nigerian citizens. His mother acquired U.S.\ncitizenship in August 2005 and currently resides in the U.S. (see exs. 1 and 8; Tr. 113).\nShe is a homemaker with no ties to the Nigerian government.  His father immigrated to\nthe U.S. and established permanent residence status in this country several years later\n(see ex. 8; Tr.113-14).  He  continues to split his time between the U.S. and Nigeria to\nattend to his importing business (Tr. 113-14).  His father\u2019s  principal Nigerian customers\nare schools and hospitals (primarily private ones).  Before immigrating to the U.S., his\nfather was involved in supply projects for the Nigerian government.  He severed his ties\nwith the Nigerian government before he immigrated to the U.S., and has no plans to\nreinstate them (Tr., 68-69).  \nApplicant has two brothers and two sisters.  His brothers immigrated to the U.S.\nbefore Applicant, and became naturalized U.S. citizens in September 2004 (see exs. 1\nand 8; Tr.101, 115).  They currently reside in the U.S. and have no known contacts with\nthe Nigerian government (Tr.115-16).  Applicant\u2019s sisters both immigrated to the U.S.\nprior to Applicant, and they, too, have continued to reside in this country (Tr. 101).  Each\nof his sisters has permanent residence status (see exs. G and H).  Both have expressed\ntheir individual  intentions to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as they are eligible to do\nso (Tr.116).  \nBesides his only immediate and extended family members residing in Nigeria, his\nwife\u2019s parents and siblings are also citizens and residents of the country (Tr. 116-17).\nHis father-in-law is a retired  dentist; his mother-in-law is a homemaker (Tr. 69, 117).\nNeither has any connections or interests with the Nigerian government.  His in-laws all\n\n5\nreside in the Eloran region, which is situated about five hours northwest of the capital city\nof Lagos (Tr. 118-20).  \nApplicant still maintains a small savings account in Nigeria.  He opened this\naccount when he returned to the country in December 2006, and has not maintained it\nsince he returned to the U.S. in July 2007 (Tr., at ).  He knows of no conflicts of interest\nthat his parents could have with the Nigerian government and no reason to believe he\ncould  ever have a conflict of interest with his parents and the Nigerian government that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest with his security responsibilities to the U.S.\nOther than this small savings account, he has no assets or financial interests in Nigeria\nor any other foreign country (see ex. 8).  By contrast, all of his assets are in the U.S. (Tr.\n78).\n  \nApplicant does not belong to any foreign organizations, and his parents and\nextended family members remain his only contacts in Nigeria.  He has never accepted\nany rights or benefits from the government of  Nigeria, and does not enjoy any rights or\nprivileges as the result of his dual citizenship status (ex. 8).  Applicant has never pursued\nany political office in Nigeria, or other foreign country, and has never served in a foreign\nmilitary, or voted in a foreign election (see ex. 8).  \nNigeria\u2019s country status\nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa that gained its independence from\nGreat Britain in 1960 as a federation of three regions (northern, western and eastern).\nToday, Nigeria comprises 36 states and the capital territory of Lagos.  It has a population\nbase of 140 million (see Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at 7-8). Since gaining its\nindependence, Nigeria has experienced periods of political instability, economic crises,\nethnic and religious conflict, extreme poverty, a lack of law and order, judicial corruption,\nand military coups (see CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, supra, at\nsummary; Background Note: Nigeria, supra).  Nigeria has been ruled by its military for 28\nof its 43 years since independence.  The country returned to civilian rule in May 1999\n(see  CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, supra).\nBesides being the largest trading partner of the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa, with\ntotal two-way trade valued at $30.8 billion, Nigeria remains Africa\u2019s largest oil producer.\nState Department reports confirm that Nigeria\u2019s bilateral relationship with the U.S. has\ncontinued to improve (see Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at  id., at 8-11).  The trade\nbalance significantly favors Nigeria, though, due to its oil exports, which continue to be\nsubstantial.\n Insurgent activities have brought turmoil to the Niger Delta region\u2019s oil producing\nsector over perceived uneven and/or unfair oil revenue distribution (see see  CRS Report\nfor Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, supra, at 15-16).  In response to numerous reports\nof kidnaping for ransom of persons associated with the petroleum sector (including U.S.\ncitizens), the U.S. State Department has updated its Travel Warning for Nigeria in\nDecember 2008 (see Travel Warning: Nigeria, supra, at 1-2). The Travel Warning advises\n\n6\nU.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of further deterioration of security in\nthe Niger Delta region (see id; Country Specific Information, Nigeria, supra, at 2-3). The\nTravel Warning states, too, that al-Qaeda leadership operating in the region has\nexpressed interest in overthrowing the ruling authorities (see id., at 1).\nDespite its democratic government and an established judiciary, Nigeria\u2019s\ngovernment suffers from a poor human rights record (see 2008 Human Rights Report:\nNigeria, supra, at 1-24). The State Department\u2019s 2008 Human Rights Report documents\nNigerian government officials at all levels committing serious abuses against Nigeria\u2019s\ncitizens and visitors.  Documented abuses by security forces include politically motivated,\nextrajudicial killings as well as torture and arbitrary arrest (see id., at 7-12).  Instability and\nincidents of armed conflicts between religious, political, and ethnic factions comprising\nMuslim, Christian and other ethnic groups have marked Nigeria\u2019s political landscape\n(Warden Messages, supra; Travel Warning: Nigeria, supra, at 1).\nIn the areas of peace and security, the U.S. has supported peacekeeping and\nsimulation centers at Nigeria\u2019s armed forces staff college (Africa\u2019s only such center), while\npromoting effective civilian oversight of the military and its adherence to human rights\nnorms (see  Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at 12).  In addition to its efforts aimed at\nfostering maritime cooperation with security services in the Niger Delta region, the U.S.\nhas continued to support the European Union\u2019s leading role in helping Nigeria fight\ncorruption, organized criminal elements, drug traffickers, and terrorists (see id.).  Reports\nconfirm that Nigeria remains a member in good standing of ECOWAS, a West-African\ntrade union and a constructive trading partner with the U.S. (see id.). \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nWhile in college (1995-2003), Applicant obtained several credit cards, which he\nused to finance personal items (ex. 8).  With these credit cards, Applicant accrued a\nconsiderable amount of debt. With only part-time jobs to sustain him in college, he fell\nbehind on his credit card debts.  Once he graduated and began working, he was able to\naddress most of these old credit card debts.  But he also assumed new credit card debts,\nwhich he was able to repay, as long as he maintained a full time job (ex. 8).  \nSometime in 2001, Applicant relinquished his full-time job and entered graduate\nschool.  With only a part time job to take care of his personal needs while he attended\nschool, he fell behind with his financial obligations and could not bring them current (see\nex. 8). \nWhen he returned to full time employment in 2003, Applicant was able to address\nhis old debts again (see ex. 8).  However, he did not earn enough money to repay all of his\nold obligations (ex. 8). As a result, his old debts became delinquent, and he began\naccumulating additional interest and penalties.  Once he began earning enough money to\ninitiate major repayment efforts, he learned that his debts had become too large to repay.\nHis full time jobs lasted about three years (2003 to 2006).  Finding his full-time job did not\nsatisfy his expectations, he left the job in early 2006.  Between 2006 and 2008, he worked\n\n7\nsmall jobs (including the jobs he worked while living in Nigeria in 2007) and could not\naddress his old debts (see ex. 8).\nRecords document that three of Applicant\u2019s creditors obtained adverse judgments\nagainst him over a three-year span between December 2005 and November 2008 (see\nexs. 4, 5 and 8).  Creditor 1. a obtained a default judgment against Applicant in November\n2008 in the amount of $10,722.  This creditor 1.a judgment was based on a debt owed to\ncreditor 1.h, on one of the credit card accounts Applicant opened in 2003 (see exs. 3, 4\nand 8; Tr., at 88-92).  Applicant wrote to the court in March 2009, claiming he was never\nserved with the complaint and never received any notices of the scheduled default hearing\n(see ex. M).  Applicant documents his motion to the court to vacate the default and the\ncourt\u2019s ensuing order of June 2009 vacating its entry of a default judgment (see exs. A, B\nand L).  However, he proffered no defense of the underlying debt.\nIn a follow-up submission, Applicant documented a stipulation of settlement he\ncompleted with creditor 1.a and a copy of a money order of $250.00 that represents his\nfirst installment under his settlement agreement (see ex. R).  The terms of the settlement\nprovide for a reduced payout of $3,100, payable in monthly installments of $250,\ncommencing in August 2009.  Under this stipulated settlement, Applicant\u2019s default on any\nof the scheduled monthly payments is grounds for restoring the judgment to the full\namount demanded in the complaint, plus costs and interest at the legal rate of interest\nprovided by state law (ex. R).\nTwo other creditors (creditors 1.b and 1.c) obtained adverse judgments against\nApplicant (see exs. 3, 4 and 6; Tr., at 95-100).  Creditor 1.b obtained its judgment in\nDecember 2005 in the amount of $4,705.  This judgment covers an underlying credit card\naccount that Applicant opened in February 1999 (see ex. 4).  This is one of the old credit\ncard accounts that Applicant defaulted on during periods of unemployment and\nunderemployment.  Creditor 1.c obtained a judgment against Applicant in January 2006 for\n$3,670 that covers an underlying credit card account with the same creditor referenced in\ncreditor 1.b\u2019s judgment (see ex. 5).\nApplicant documents his post-hearing contacts with creditors 1.b and 1.c to explore\nmonthly payment arrangements.  So far, Applicant has not been able to work out any\npayment agreements with either of these judgment creditors (see ex. L).  He hopes to\nestablish payment plans with these two judgment creditors after he settles his smaller\ndebts (Tr., at 86-88).\nBesides Applicant\u2019s three judgment creditors, he accumulated a number of other\ndelinquent debts between 2003 and 2008 (seven in all).  These accrued debts exceed\n$7,000 in the aggregate and have not been repaid to date.  Two of the listed debts\n(creditors 1.i and 1.j) represent duplications of his creditor 1.e debt.  Applicant documents\na payment offer from creditor 1.e on the listed $772 delinquent balance (see ex. Q).  This\nJuly 2009 settlement offer provides for payment of $290, payable in two installments\nbeginning in July 2009. Applicant does not include any acceptance or payment\n\n8\ndocumentation in his post-hearing submissions.  So, at this time it is unclear whether he\naccepted the creditor\u2019s offer and made the required initial payment. \nApplicant\u2019s two remaining debts are listed as creditors 1.f and 1.g.  Creditor 1.f\nrepresents a delinquent debt from an aged auto installment account opened in 1999 in the\namount of $595 (see ex. 6).  While Applicant remains open to making $100 monthly\npayments to this creditor, he has not been able to make any payment arrangements to\ndate on this debt.  Applicant\u2019s other debt (a creditor 1.g debt) covers an unpaid traffic ticket\nin the amount of $460.  Applicant has not made any efforts to date to pay this debt, and\nintends to address it when he has resolved his debts with creditors 1.d and 1.e. \nApplicant attributes his debt problems to unexpected medical emergencies and\nunstable employment.   Most of his accrued debts are quite old (see exs. 4 through 6).  In\nthe past, he has had his wages garnished to cover a fitness center debt.  Records show\nthat when he did not pay the bill, the fitness center filed suit, obtained a judgment, and\ngarnished his wages (around $2,800) before filing a warrant of satisfaction (see ex. 9; Tr.,\nat 110-11).  Applicant satisfied this underlying debt through the garnishment process,\nwhich ended in January 2009 (Tr., at 111). \nAt this time, Applicant has limited means to address his listed debts.  He has a net\nmonthly income of $3,911,  net monthly expenses of $2,965, and a net monthly remainder\nof $565 (see ex. 3).  \nSince the hearing, Applicant has met with a financial adviser to discuss his plan for\naddressing his debts with monthly payment arrangements (see ex. Q).  He reportedly\ndiscussed his debt to income ratio with his financial adviser, and how it might be improved\nwith the implementation of his payment plans.  Details of his discussions with this financial\nadvisor are not expressed in the advisor\u2019s July 2009 letter.\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in January 2008, Applicant omitted his possession of\nan active Nigerian passport issued in January 2001.  His Nigerian passport was not due to\nexpire until December 2010 (see ex. 1).  Applicant attributes his passport omission to his\nmistaken focus devoted to the issuance date of the passport, and failed to pick up the\nconjunctive part of the question that asked hm about his continued possession within the\npast seven years (Tr., at 124-29).\nIn the same e-QIP Applicant completed in January 2008, Applicant also omitted his\nMay 2006 arrest for failure to appear.  Applicant did subsequently appear on the charge\nand satisfied the warrant.  In turn, he was assigned a court date in September 2006 to\nappear and contest the underlying charge (Tr., at 139).  When he appeared in court, he\npleaded guilty to the original charge (see ex. J; Tr., at 139-43). \nApplicant attributes his traffic ticket omission to his claimed unawareness of his\nhaving an arrest record (see Answer; Tr., at 130-34).  Since he was never taken into\n\n9\ncustody, and never (to the best of his knowledge)  fined over $150 (the e-QIP threshold for\ntraffic-related offenses), he denied any arrest associated with the ticket.  He was surprised\nwhen he later checked the police department\u2019s records in April 2009 and  found a police\nreport of the incident on file with the department\u2019s records (see Answer; Tr., at 141-42).\nWhen asked by an interviewing agent from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) in a follow-up interview about his holding a valid Nigerian passport, Applicant\nacknowledged his holding the passport without any apparent prodding or adversarial\nconfrontation (see ex. 9).  He was never asked by the OPM agent about his 2006 arrest,\nand Applicant never volunteered any information to the agent.  \nConsidering all of the surrounding circumstances of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nand his ensuing passport disclosure, his claims of mistaken understandings about the\nscope of the pertinent e-QIP questions are accepted as truthful. Inferences warrant that\nhis omissions were not intentional ones.    \nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisors. They consider him a valued employee\nwho retains the confidence of his management team (see ex. K). His group manager\ncharacterizes him as polite, professional and dedicated in his work. His project lead\ndescribes him as reliable, moral and ethical.  Both members of Applicant\u2019s management\nteam support his security clearance application.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"[c]onditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nconcerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\n\n10\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. See revised Adjudication\nGuidelines (AGs), \u00b6 18.\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  AG, \u00b6 6.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\n\n11\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as a conscientious quality assurance specialist for a defense\ncontractor who after being born and raised in Nigeria, immigrated to the U.S. in 1994 to\npursue his education.  While most of his immediate family members reside in the U.S.,\neither as dual U.S. citizens or with permanent residence status, his father (who is a\nNigerian citizen) splits his time between the U.S. and Nigeria and retains business\ninterests in Nigeria.  Since immigrating to the U.S., Applicant accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts during periods of unemployment and underemployment, most of which\nhe has not been able to resolve. \nApplicant\u2019s debt accruals raise initial security concerns about the stability of his\nfinances which can affect his reliability and trustworthiness. His family relationships with\nhis immediate and extended family members with demonstrated ties to Nigeria raise\nconcerns about his ability to avert potential conflicts of interests over his trust\ncommitments to the U.S. and his duties and responsibilities to his immediate and\nextended family members. Security concerns are raised, too, over Applicant\u2019s omissions\nof his Nigerian passport and traffic-related arrest when he completed his January 2008\ne-QIP.  \nFinancial Issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised AGs where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nwhich can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his past\ninability to pay these debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC\n\u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n\n12\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable to recurrent periods of unemployment and\nunderemployment between 1999 and 2008.  Faced with so many pressing challenges in\nfinding sustainable work, while completing his college studies and caring for his family\u2019s\nneeds, Applicant struggled with his mounting debts. \nApplicant\u2019s progress to date in regaining control of his finances is encouraging,\nbut still a considerable work in progress that is only recently being addressed.  He still is\nworking on addressing his three major judgments and other remaining debts and can\nprovide no estimates as to when he will be able to make any significant headway on two\nof his still outstanding judgment and the other two debts he acknowledges. \nTo his credit, Applicant is able to document a settlement arrangement with his\nlargest judgment creditor (creditor 1.a).  However, his payment arrangements have only\nrecently been approved and initiated with a good-faith first payment.  Further, his\nsettlement agreement contains some very onerous enforcement machinery, should\nApplicant ever default on any of his agreed $250 monthly payments.\nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nsome extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As a result,\nMC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019 s circumstances.\nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts with creditor 1.a and his session with his financial advisor\nentitle him to some mitigation credit under both  MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Both of these\nmitigating  conditions have partial application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nFull mitigation credit is not available to Applicant, however, based on the facts of\nthis case. Neither Applicant\u2019s oral nor written evidence reflect any initiated voluntary\nrepayment efforts in his behalf on his major debts.  His only documented payment\nagreement with individual creditors is encouraging, but not enough at this time to\nwarrant full application of any of the mitigating conditions covered in the financial\nguideline.\n \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern over applicants with troubled finances is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in financial cases.\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts.  His positive endorsements\n\n13\nfrom his management team merit considerable praise and commendation. His\ncompleted settlement efforts with one of his judgment creditors (creditor 1.a) is\nencouraging. In balance, though, he has not shown enough tangible effort in addressing\nhis covered debts to mitigate his still delinquent debts and credit him with restored\ncontrol over his finances. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them with,\nand the modest steps he has mounted to address his old debts, it is still too soon to\nmake safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore\nhis finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.h. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.i through 1.j\nForeign Influence\nBy virtue of his birth in Nigeria to parents of Nigerian descent and citizenship,\nApplicant was endowed with Nigerian citizenship through his parents.  This citizenship\ncould not be lost except by express renunciation, approved by the Nigerian\nGovernment, which Applicant has never explored.  While many of his family members\nenjoy dual citizenship with the U.S. and Nigeria, they retain presumptively strong ties\nwith their birth country (Nigeria), as does Applicant.\nSecurity concerns are also raised over the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily (i.e., his parents and brother) and in-laws who are citizens and residents of\nNigeria, a country historically plagued by military coups, domestic turmoil, and a poor\nhuman rights record.  Department Counsel urges security concerns over risks that\nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother and in-laws residing in Nigeria might be subject to undue\nforeign influence by Nigerian government and military authorities to access classified\ninformation in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s father and immediate family members and in-laws reside (at\nleast part of the time) in Nigeria, they present potential heightened security risks\ncovered by disqualifying condition (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the foreign influence guideline. The\ncitizenship/residence status of these immediate family members and in-laws in Nigeria\npose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign\ninfluence that could compromise sensitive or classified information under Applicant's\npossession and/or control. \nDue to the paucity of contacts Applicant has historically had with his in-laws,\npotential risks associated with his in-laws residing in Nigeria must be considerably\ndiscounted.  Moreover, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members have any\n\n14\nidentified affiliations or contacts with Nigerian  officials currently known to be associated\nwith intelligence or military organizations interested in collecting proprietary or sensitive\ninformation in the U.S.  And from what is known from the presented evidence, none of\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family and in-laws residing in Nigeria have any (a) political\naffiliations with Nigeria\u2019s government or military, (b) history to date of being subjected to\nany coercion or influence, or (c) indications of any vulnerability to the same.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria, but resides in the\nU.S. on the strength of her permanent residence card.  Like his mother, his brothers are\ndual citizens of the U.S. and Nigeria, but maintain permanent residence in the U.S. And\nwhile his sisters await their naturalization as U.S. citizens., they, too, remain in the U.S.\non the basis of their permanent residency status. Only his father spends substantial\ntime in Nigeria, and he, too, awaits the opportunity to apply for U.S. citizenship. \nNigeria, although a country reported to have a history of military coups and\nhuman rights violations, enjoys a non-hostile relationship with the U.S., and is a\ndemocratic government with some respect for the rule of law in the areas of foreign\ntrade and commerce.  While Nigeria has a documented record of turmoil and kidnaping\nin its oil-rich Niger Delta region, it generally enjoys stable diplomatic and trade\nrelationships with the U.S. \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate\nparticular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign\ncountries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the\nsupplied materials and country information about Nigeria. \nNigeria remains a non-hostile trading partner of the U.S. and is a country whose\ndemocratic institutions are not wholly incompatible with our own traditions and respect\nfor human rights and the rule of law.  Unlike the old AGs, the new ones explicitly take\ninto account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important\nconsideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency\nelsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the\nparticular foreign regime involved do matter. Nigeria, while reported to have human\nrights and insurgency issues in its Niger Delta region, is still a country with no known\nrecent history of government-sponsored hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue\ninfluence against family members to obtain either classified information, or unclassified\neconomic and proprietary data. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's relatives in\nNigeria, any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence\nbrought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary\ndata out of Applicant through his family members residing in Nigeria is quite remote.\nApplicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC\n8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\n\n15\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nMC (8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest,\u201d has application, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Since relocating to the U.S. in\n1996, Applicant has demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to\nthe U.S.  Whatever potential conflicts he may have through his dual Nigerian citizenship\nand contacts with his family members in Nigeria have been more than counterbalanced\nby his demonstrated U.S. citizenship responsibilities.  \nAppraising risks associated with Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship status with Nigeria,\nthe presence of Applicant family members in Nigeria, his past family visits to Nigeria,\nand his regular contacts with these family members, any risk of undue foreign influence\non Applicant and/or his parents, siblings, and to an even lesser extent, his in-laws, who\nreside in Nigeria, would appear to be insubstantial, and clearly not of the magnitude that\ncould make them subject to a heightened security risk of coercion, pressure or\ncompromise under Guideline B.\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflict of interests with his Nigerian family members. Not only is Applicant a naturalized\nU.S. citizen who received his college training at recognized American colleges following\nhis relocation here, but he has made every effort to work, save, and pursue his financial\ninterests exclusively in the U.S. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being\nbrought to bear on any of his immediate family members and in-laws would appear to\nbe minimal.  By all reasonable accounts of the presented record, Applicant has no\nvisible conflicts of interest with Nigerian citizen/residents in Nigeria that could be at risk\nto exploitation or compromise by Nigerian military or intelligence officials. With the\nexception of his father (who splits time between the U.S. and Nigeria) and his wife\u2019s\nfamily members, Applicant\u2019s immediate family members have since joined Applicant in\nadopting the U.S. as their home country and maintain few contacts in Nigeria.  Based\non Applicant\u2019s credible accounts, it is unlikely, too, that any of his immediate family\nmembers will establish any contacts with Nigerian authorities in the foreseeable future\nthat could  create any conflicts of interest for Applicant.\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family\nmembers and in-laws residing in Nigeria are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence\nattributable to his familial relationships in Nigeria.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 2.a through 2.i of Guideline B.\n\n16\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s omitted active Nigerian\npassport and traffic-related arrest in the e-QIP he completed in January 2008.  He\ndenied any intent to falsify in his answer and affirmatively and credibly explained his\nmisunderstanding of question 17 when answering \u201cno\u201d to the question pertaining to his\npossession of a Nigerian passport within the last seven years. He attributed his\nomission of his failure-to-appear arrest to his unawareness of any arrest associated with\nhis traffic offense.  His credible explanations enable him to avert inferences of knowing\nand wilful concealment of his possession of a foreign passport and his arrest record. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\napplicant who has made considerable progress in becoming assimilated in his adopted\ncountry (the U.S.), with most of his immediate family members (mother, brothers,\nsisters, and wife), and answered his e-QIP as honestly and completely as he could with\nhis limited understanding of security forms. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s accepted explanations of his e-QIP omissions and his\noverall honesty and candor showing, he is able to successfully refute the allegations of\ndeliberate falsification in the SOR.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 3.a and 3.b of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2(a) of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\n   F  o rmal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas: 1.b through 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparas.  1.a and 1i through 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas. 2.a through 2.i::\n           For Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas. 3.a and 3.b:\n      \n           For Applicant\n\n17\n \nConclusions            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nSeptember 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to Guidelines B and E and as to three of the allegations under\n1\nGuideline F.  Therefore, only the remaining allegations under Guideline F are in issue in this appeal.\n2\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.   Specifically, Applicant objects to two statements made by the Judge.\n1\nApplicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s decision should be reversed because Applicant successfully\nmitigated all the government\u2019s security concerns and because an adverse security clearance decision\nwill have a negative impact on Applicant\u2019s financial situation and his employment prospects.\nFinding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: While in college and working only\npart-time, Applicant accumulated a considerable amount of credit card debt and fell behind in his\npayments.  Applicant was able to address most of those debts when he obtained full-time\nemployment after graduation, although he also accrued new debt, which he was able to repay from\nhis full-time salary.  Upon switching to part-time employment to attend graduate school in 2001,\nApplicant again accumulated substantial credit card debt and fell behind on that debt.  When\nApplicant began working full-time again in 2003, he began to address his old debts, but he did not\nearn enough money to repay them.  The old debts became delinquent, and additional interest and\npenalties accrued.  Applicant worked full-time between 2003 and 2006.  During that time, Applicant\nrealized that his debts had become too large for him to repay.  Applicant left his full-time job in 2006\nbecause it did not satisfy his expectations.  Between 2006 and 2008, Applicant worked at small jobs\nand could not address his old debts.  Applicant reached a settlement agreement regarding the largest\ndebt in the SOR and documented payment of the first installment toward that agreement.  At the time\nof the hearing, Applicant had not been able reach settlement agreements with the next two largest\ncreditors.  The Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding three debts in the SOR that were\nduplicates.  Applicant did not document payment of the other debts.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nIn his appeal, Applicant discusses steps he has taken to improve his financial situation, and\nhe includes documentation for payments made after the closing of the record.  Any remedial steps\ntaken and any payments made after the close of the record constitute new evidence, which the Board\ncannot consider on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The failure to consider such new evidence does\nnot demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00184 at 2 (App. Bd.\nOct. 9, 2007).\n\nThe Judge found that two other debts were duplicates of other debts in the SOR, but the amounts of those debts\n2\nwere small.\n3\nApplicant contests two statements in the Judge\u2019s decision.  Regarding the first, Applicant\nnotes that  the Judge correctly found in his favor as to SOR paragraph 1.a because paragraphs 1.a and\n1.h represent the same debt.  However, in the \u201cSummary of Pleadings\u201d section of his decision, the\nJudge did not subtract the duplicate amount from the total owed by Applicant.   Decision at 2.  In\n2\nthe \u201cSummary of Pleadings,\u201d the Judge was summarizing the SOR allegations.  Later in the decision,\nthe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to a number of the allegations.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s\nstatement cited by Applicant is not erroneous.  \nAs to the other statement noted by Applicant, the Judge referenced Applicant\u2019s monthly\nincome and expenses and the resulting remainder.  Decision at 8.  Applicant indicates that, as of the\ntime of the hearing, his monthly remainder had increased significantly.  As Applicant points out, the\nfigures stated by the Judge came from information Applicant provided in December 2008.  If\nApplicant wished the Judge to consider that his monthly remainder had increased by the time of the\nhearing on June 29, 2009, Applicant could have provided that information at the hearing and in fact\nhad the burden to do so.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The record supports the Judge\u2019s statement in this\nregard.\nApplicant also contends that he satisfied the government\u2019s security concerns and that the\nJudge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (May 23, 2008).\nFinally, Applicant indicates that an adverse security clearance decision will have a negative\nimpact on his financial situation and his employment prospects, stating that he lost the job he held\nat the time of the hearing and that he has found another job, but the offer is contingent on his having\na security clearance.  The possible effect a security clearance decision could have on an applicant\u2019s\neconomic situation is not relevant or material to whether a Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10079 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2009).  See also ISCR\nCase No. 08-00899 at n.1 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008).  \u201cThe adverse impact of a clearance decision on\nan applicant is not relevant or material to an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.\u201d  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision\n\n4\nat 17.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general standard\nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity\u2019\u201d). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 14, 2009. She\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 12, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 16, 2009, and I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on April 9, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-6,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified in her own behalf. She\nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A-C which were admitted into the record. I held the record open\nApril 29, 2009\n\n2\nuntil April 17, 2009 for any documents that Applicant wished to submit. Applicant\nsubmitted three documents, which were marked as AE D-F. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated February 14, 2009, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l of the SOR. She provided additional information\nto support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1983, and attended a community college but did not obtain a degree. She\nworked from 1983 until 2007 full time for the federal government and received raises\nand promotions working as a budget analyst. She has worked for her current employer\nsince June 2008 (GE 1). She held a security clearance when she first joined the federal\ngovernment in 1983 (Tr. 54).\nApplicant is single with two children, ages 19 and 17. She has never received\nchild support from the father of the children (Tr. 45). She and her children lived with her\nmother after high school until 1996 (Tr. 124).\nIn 1996, she purchased a home. She and her children and her boyfriend lived\ntogether in the home (Tr. 127). Her boyfriend was a contractor and Applicant was\nworking for the federal government. She reports that they were financially sound (Tr.\n37). When her boyfriend lost his job, she could not manage financially. Applicant could\nnot remember when he lost his job. She reported she could afford the home with her\nfriend\u2019s income but got behind in the mortgage when he lost his job. She was also\npaying her boyfriend\u2019s bills. Applicant stated that her expenses were more than her\nincome could afford. She could not maintain her mortgage and various expenses. She\nincurred delinquent debt.\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2000 on the advice of legal\ncounsel. Her debts were discharged on or about July 2002 (GE 6). The amount\ndischarged was approximately $83,600 (GE 1).  \nAfter the bankruptcy, she lived with her niece from 2000 until 2006 (Tr. 131).\nApplicant paid half the utilities. In approximately 2006, she also co-signed a car note for\nher niece because her niece did not have good credit.\nApplicant purchased her mother\u2019s home in 2006. Her mother paid half the\nmortgage until she died late in 2006. During this time Applicant obtained a second\nmortgage of approximately $30,000 to redecorate the home, make home repairs, such\nas a new roof, and remodel a bathroom (Tr. 77).  She also purchased a new vehicle for\n\n3\napproximately $41,000 (Tr. 89). The monthly payment was $985. She has remained\ncurrent with her car payment.\nWhen Applicant\u2019s mother died, Applicant could no longer afford the home\nmortgage. She acknowledged that before her mother died she was able to spend\nmoney on other things. Her home was foreclosed in 2007. The mortgage loan was\napproximately $280,000 (Tr. 113). Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July\n2007. The petition was dismissed on August 6, 2007 (AE) B. Applicant did not proceed\nwith the bankruptcy because she did not want to include a vehicle that her niece was\nusing for transportation to work (Tr. 66).\nApplicant resigned from her position in September 2007, after 24 years, for a\nvariety of reasons (Tr. 40). She was feeling stressed and was offered a leave of\nabsence but decided not to take one. At that time her salary was $106,000. When she\nresigned, she received a lump sum retirement amount ($72,000) and unemployment\nbenefits for a total of $81,000 (Tr. 49). She was unemployed from September 2007 until\nApril 2008. \nApplicant had entered into another relationship at this time. Her boyfriend lived\nwith her in her home before it was foreclosed. They moved into an apartment and she\nremained in this relationship until 2008. He did not contribute financially to the\nrelationship. She paid some of his expenses, such as his car insurance.\nIn 2009, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on the advice of legal counsel\n(GE 4). She has paid $1,165 for the first three months (AE A). She will have a monthly\npayment of $1,795 for the next 57 months if her plan is approved. However, the\nconfirmation hearing is in May and the amount could change based on an increase in\nher income and a deficiency of $27,000 for the second home mortgage. Applicant is\nhoping that her car payment will be put into the bankruptcy as a \u201ccram down\u201d and her\nmonthly payment to the trustee would include the car note.\nThe SOR alleged 10 delinquent debts, including a defaulted mortgage, voluntary\nrepossession, and credit card bills. Applicant admitted the debts and her credit reports\nconfirmed them. The total amount of delinquent debt was approximately $42,112. The\ndebts are incorporated into the Chapter 13 bankruptcy (AE A).\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan included additional debts not listed on the SOR.\nApplicant had a 2008 judgment of $1,890 for rent and a $50 judgment to an oil\ncompany. Applicant submitted documentation that she paid the oil company $728.68 in\n2008 which satisfied the principal owed but did not include the court costs (AE E). She\nalso settled another account for $340 (AE F).\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $6,125. After her monthly expenses,\nshe has a net remainder of $1,100. She is current with her bills. She now lives in an\napartment with her two children. Her son\u2019s daughter visits on the weekends. She helps\n\n4\nsupport her grandchild. Her son does not contribute to the household. Her daughter is in\nhigh school and does not work. \nApplicant completed the required financial counseling when filing for her\nbankruptcy. This was approximately a one hour course on line. She has never sought\nformal financial counseling.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nAG \u00b6 19(b) \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt\u201d is another disqualifying condition. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\naccumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts for a period of almost ten years.\nShe has filed for bankruptcy on three occasions. After the first bankruptcy her debts\nwere discharged in 2002. She spent above her means after her first bankruptcy. She\npurchased a home and then resigned a job rather than take a leave of absence. She\nadmits that she did not meet her financial obligations from 2000 until the present. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties span a period of nine years. She has recently filed her third\nbankruptcy petition. A Chapter 7 was discharged in 2002 and a Chapter 13 was\ndismissed in 2007. She co-signed a car note for her niece when she was having\nfinancial difficulties. The 2009 Chapter 13 has not yet been confirmed. This potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply. \n\n6\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant earned a\nsalary with step increases and promotions from 1983 until 2007. She resigned in 2007\nrather than take a leave of absence. She was unemployed for a period in 2007 until\n2008. She admits making poor financial decisions. I find this mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant completed the required financial counseling when\nfiling for bankruptcy. This was approximately a one hour course on line. She has never\nsought formal financial counseling. Applicant has recently filed her Chapter 13\nbankruptcy petition and has made the first three payments in the plan. Given her cycle\nof delinquent debts and prior bankruptcy filings, it is too soon to find that there are clear\nindications that the problem is under control. I conclude these mitigating conditions do\nnot apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, intelligent\nwoman. She worked in the federal government for 24 years. When she resigned in\n2007, she was earning approximately $106,000. She decided not to take a leave of\nabsence. She took her entire retirement fund and in a year it was gone. She spent\nabove her means and paid the bills of her boyfriends instead of managing her own\nmoney. She purchased a home and then shortly after resigned. She used a legal means\nto resolve debt but has not seemed to change her behavior. She has not received\nformal financial counseling. She co-signed car note for her niece when she had financial\n\n7\ndifficulties of her own. She bought a $41,000 vehicle after her second bankruptcy. She\nhas shown poor judgment and financial irresponsibility.\n In January 2009, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. She has made\nthe first three payments. She acknowledges her past financial mistakes. While she is\nusing a legal means of debt resolution and intends to pay her debts now, her recent\nefforts are not sufficient for her to meet the burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 29, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(e-QIP), on July 18, 2008 (Item 5). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F concerning the Applicant. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n Applicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 1, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on June 16, 2009. The Applicant received the FORM on June\n23, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. He elected not to\nsubmit any additional information. The case was assigned to me on September 9, 2009.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 45 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nis financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Applicant admitted both of the allegations under this paragraph.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a company for a judgment in the\namount of $32,027 since 2007. This debt has not been paid and the Applicant states in\nan interrogatory dated December 30, 2008, \u201cThis debt was incurred by the corporation I\nowned which was closed when the housing market crashed in 2006. I do not plan to\nrepay this debt with personal funds.\u201d (Item 6 at 2.)\n1.b.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a bank in the amount of $10,547\nsince 2007. This debt has not been paid and the Applicant states in an interrogatory\ndated December 30, 2008, \u201cThis debt was also incurred by the corporation I owned\nwhich was closed when the housing market crashed in 2006. I do not plan to repay this\ndebt with personal funds.\u201d (Item 6 at 3.) \nAs stated above, according to the Applicant, both of these debts were related to\na business he co-owned with his brother-in-law from March 2005 through December\n2006.  (Item 5 at 10-11.) In his Answer the Applicant states, \u201cIn accordance with IRS tax\ncode and generally accepted accounting practices upon the closure of the business\nthese liabilities were converted to assets and taxed as profit. All tax debts related to\nthese debts, those of the corporation and me personally have been paid.\u201d The Applicant\nsubmitted no evidence to support this statement.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b618:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b619(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has over $ 42,000 in past due\ndebts, both of which have been due and owing for a considerable period. The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following conditions have applicability in\nthis case:\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nappear to be connected to a business which failed in 2006. However, he has presented\nno evidence supporting his statement that these debts have been forgiven by the\ncreditors, which is how a debt may become an asset. On the contrary, all the available\nevidence show these debts to be his responsibility and severely past due. This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant argues that these debts were\nrelated to his business and are, therefore, not his personal responsibility. He provides\nno records to show that the business was an entity for which he had no personal\nliability. To the contrary, Applicant\u2019s credit reports show that he was jointly responsible\nfor the debt in subparagraph 1.a. (Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 2); and individually responsible\nfor the debt in subparagraph 1.b. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 4,12). He affirmatively states\nthat he has no intention of satisfying either of these debts. This mitigating condition is\nnot applicable to this case.\n\n5\nAG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s credit reports show\nthat, in the main, he is making sufficient payments on his current indebtedness.\nHowever, as stated above, he does not intend to resolve his considerable past due\nindebtedness.  This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nBased on all of the available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph 1 is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a decision: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a history of not\npaying his debts.  In addition, he affirmatively states that he has no intention of paying\nthese debts. As set forth above, I cannot find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). In addition, I find that there is the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is a likelihood of\nrecurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\ngovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the government's Statement of Reasons. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005,\nwhich are effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant admitted six of the eight allegations set forth\nin the SOR and constructively denied two of the allegations. She also requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2009. Department Counsel and\nApplicant agreed to a hearing date of June 23, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued to\nthat effect on June 4, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave\ntestimony, offered no documents, and was given through the close of business on July\nJuly 31, 2009\n\n SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a.\n      1\n To date, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband has not paid child support for the past three years.

Department Counsel offered four\ndocuments admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-4 without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the\nproceeding was received on July 1, 2009. On July 15, 2009, Applicant transmitted 11\ndocuments by facsimile transmission to Department Counsel. They were forwarded to\nme on July 20, 2009, and accepted into the record as Exs. A-K without objection. The\nrecord was then closed. Based upon a review of the testimony, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant met her burden regarding the security concerns raised.\nSecurity clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old customer service representative who has worked for\nthe same defense contractor for 11 years. Applicant earned a high school diploma and\ncompleted one year of college. Married, Applicant has two minor children.\nIn 1998, Applicant divorced her first husband. The couple had two credit cards,\nCard A and Card Ba MasterCard and a Discover Card. They informally divided the\ncards between themselves: Applicant assumed control over the MasterCard and her ex-\nhusband took possession of the Discover Card. Applicant stayed current on her\nMasterCard until it went into default in 2007.  Applicant was financially burdened at the\n1\ntime. Her ex-husband had not paid court-ordered child support since early 2006 and her\nadjustable rate mortgage payments ballooned from $900 to $1,500 a month.  The credit\n2\ncard company took the matter to court, resulting in a judgment of approximately $5,000\nagainst Applicant.  She ultimately negotiated a settlement and the account was later\n3\nsatisfied and closed in July 2009 for $4,500. She paid the settlement with the proceeds\nfrom a $7,500 promissory note from her employer. Her repayment of that sum is\nsecured under an arrangement with her employer through which the loan will be paid\nback over two years by withholding Applicant\u2019s annual bonuses.4\nIn 2008, Applicant\u2019s current husband and her elder daughter both had\nemergency surgeries. Related costs amounted to about $1,200 to $1,500 for each of\nthe two surgeries. These obligations further impacted their ability to pay other bills.5\nThat summer, Applicant was contacted by Discover Card.  She was told that the\n6\n\n Tr. 13.\n      7\n Tr. 31.\n      8\n Ex. D (Statement regarding account starting \u20136011). Compare same account number on Ex. 4 (Credit\n      9\nreport) at 1. \n Ex. 2 (Interrogatory).\n      10\n Ex. H (Payment history).\n      11\n Ex. C (Statement regarding account starting \u20139723). Compare same account number on Ex. 4 (Credit\n      12\nreport) at 2. \n Ex. E (Loan and payment history). \n      13\n Ex. A (Applicant\u2019s cover letter, section 4). Applicant states she spoke with a representative of this\n      14\ncompany. He told Applicant the car loan at issue was paid in full and that he would contact the credit reporting\nbureau to have the entry deleted.\n Ex. A, supra, note 14. Applicant states she spoke with a representative from this medical collection agent\n      15\nand was told the derogatory entry would be removed from her credit report.\n3\naccount was \u201cseriously delinquent and past due.\u201d  Unable to locate her ex-husband or\n7\nunsuccessful in pursuing the matter with him, the company tried to engage Applicant\ninto making payments on the account. Applicant was not able to pay off the entire\nDiscover Card balance, but she agreed to pay $50 a month toward the balance and\noffered to investigate why her ex-husband was not making timely payments. When she\ncontacted her ex-husband, she discovered he had used the card to transport their\nteenage daughter across the country during her visits to him. Applicant has had the\ncard cancelled so no future charges can be made by her ex-husband.  A settlement\n8\nwas negotiated for a payment of $2,500. That amount also was paid with funds from\nthe promissory note in July 2009.9\nThe SOR noted eight delinquent accounts of concern. Aside from the\nMasterCard and Discover Card, the following are at issue:\nDepartment Store (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c) ($135) and Creditor (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e)\n($228) \u2013 In repayment. Applicant worked with a credit counseling organization and an\naccount payment consolidation plan was executed in January 2009.

Her net annual salary yields about\n$2,700 a month and her husband earns a net of $1,600 a month. After all expenses\nand monthly obligations, she has a net remainder of about $300 for savings or\nemergencies. She and her husband own two cars, both of which are about 12 years\nold. They rarely eat out and the children receive modest allowances.  For a vacation\n16\nlast year, Applicant stayed home while her husband took their daughter to visit her\ngrandmother. She is current on her state and local taxes. She is in timely repayment\nthrough payroll deduction on a modest loan of about $4,000 she withdrew from her\n401(k) plan.  Her ex-husband has not paid his monthly child support for the past few\n17\nyears because he is an alcoholic and cannot maintain a job. Applicant has declined to\ntake him to court over the matter.  At work, she is a valued employee who has gained\n18\nthe trust and support of her superiors, both of whom are aware of Applicant\u2019s past\nfinancial difficulties.19\nAt the hearing, Applicant arrived without relevant paperwork and relied on\npreviously submitted documents. Without objection, she was given approximately three\nweeks to submit any documentation. She did, however, detail how she was prepared to\npay off her two largest credit card debts. Department Counsel noted that \u201c[a]ll we\u2019re\ndealing with her[e] is $12,000. You know, we\u2019re not dealing with a tremendous amount\nof debt as far as creating a security \u2013 you know, a huge security concern.\u201d  He\n20\nconcluded by stating, \u201cif [Applicant] was able to resolve the [MasterCard and Discover\nCard] debts, the Government would submit that that would go a long way in resolving all\nof the security concerns in this case.... If documents are presented to show that those\ntwo credit card debts have been resolved, then I think that the \u2013 that evidence would\nweigh favorably in her camp.\u201d  As noted above, those accounts have been paid.\n21\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      22\n Department of the Navy v.

AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n22\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n23\n24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n25\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n26\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n27\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      28\n6\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.28\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nBetween 2007 and 2008, Applicant faced financially difficult times owing to a\nsignificant rise in her monthly mortgage payment, family surgeries, and a failure by her\nex-husband to pay child support. As a result, some debts became delinquent. These\nfacts are sufficient to raise financial considerations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG\n\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nAlthough an increase in an adjustable rate mortgage can be financially vexing, it\nis not necessarily unforeseeable. Emergency surgeries and a refusal or inability of an\nex-husband to pay court ordered child support, however, cannot be wholly anticipated.\nFinancial considerations mitigating condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies. \nOne of Applicant\u2019s first efforts toward resolving the debts noted in the SOR was\nto seek the aid of a financial counseling service, where she also worked out a debt\nconsolidation plan that includes two of the accounts at issue. Since that time, she\ndemonstrated that she knows how to successfully negotiate and satisfy a settlement on\na delinquent account. Today, all of the debts at issue have been satisfied except for two\nnominal debts which were disputed and are now in the process of being deleted from\nher credit report. Consequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control\u201d) applies. \n\n7\nApplicant has paid off both her MasterCard and the Discover Card for which her\nex-husband had agreed to be responsible. This eliminates about $10,650 of the\napproximately $12,000 at issue. As noted at the hearing, this goes \u201ca long way in\nresolving all of the security concerns in this case.\u201d In addition, she satisfied all but two\nof the remaining delinquent debts at issue. The only accounts still at issue amount only\nto about $240. These two accounts are nominal, were disputed, and Applicant states\nshe  is presently waiting for them to deleted from her credit reports. FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d) applies. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor, she is a credible and mature professional. She\nhas demonstrated remarkable patience with her ex-husband, who not only reneged on\nhis promise to manage the Discover Card account, but whose alcohol abuse is\nadversely affecting his relationship with his daughter and her financial well-being.\nMoreover, although much of her success was reached shortly before the record was\nclosed, Applicant successfully addressed all of the accounts at issue and demonstrated\nher finances are under control.\nSpeaking against Applicant is the fact that, although she should not have been\nresponsible for the Discover Card and although she was unaware of some of the\nsmaller debts, her MasterCard account was knowingly neglected for almost two years.\nAlso, most of her success in addressing all of the debts at issue occurred recently. To\nher defense, however, Applicant credibly explained why the 2007-2008 period was a\nparticularly difficult time for her family financially. She has recently stabilized her\n\n8\nfinances and come to accept the fact her ex-husband cannot be relied upon to meet his\nfinancial obligations for their child. \nIn satisfying her MasterCard and Discover Card debts in the manner described\nat the hearing, Applicant went a \u201clong way in resolving the security concerns\u201d presented\nin this matter. She presented evidence of her success with these two delinquent\naccounts, as well as with the others at issue, that weighs heavily in her favor. While her\ndepiction of her personal and family finances does not portray affluence, it does reflect\na family living simply and within their means during these difficult economic times. With\nsecurity concerns regarding her finances mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent\nwith national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

The case was scheduled for hearing\non May 18, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of seven exhibits (1-7); Applicant relied on two witnesses (including\nJuly 15, 2009\n\n2\nhimself) and four exhibits (A through D)  The transcript (R.T.) was received May 27,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of (a) court filings covering creditor 1.a\u2019s instituted\nforeclosure proceedings in State 2, (b) foreclosure initiation by creditor 1.b and/or the\ncreditor\u2019s approval of a short sale or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and (c)\ncharacter references.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days, to June\n1, 2009, to supplement the record.  The Government was granted three days, to June 4,\n2009, to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of a cover letter\nto Department Counsel, declarations from his mother and a member of his church, the\nState 2 court docket sheet, and letters explaining construction delays.  Department\nCounsel offered no objection to the admission of any of Applicant\u2019s proffered exhibits.\nThe submissions were admitted as exhibits E through H.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated two delinquent\ndebts exceeding $258,000.00.  They are listed as creditors 1.a and 1.b. and will be\nreferred to in this way in the findings and conclusions.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied each of the debt  allegations.  He\nprovided no explanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old information technology coordinator for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first spouse in May 1983, and divorced her in August 1985\n(see ex. 1).  He has no children from this marriage.  He remarried his second wife in\nSeptember 1997 (ex. 1; R.T., at 50-51).  He has two young boys from this marriage, and\nresides in State 1 (R.T., at 51).  He received computer training from a local computer\nacademy, and has completed most of the credits necessary to earn an Associate of Arts\ndegree (R.T., at 49).  \nIn October 2005, Applicant purchased an undeveloped lot in State 2 for\ninvestment purposes (his first such experience) with the intention of placing a residential\nbuilding on the property (R.T., at 70, 80-83).  He financed his purchase with a\nconstruction loan with creditor 1.a for $240,435.00 secured by a first mortgage on the\nproperty (see exs. 3 through 5 and A; R.T., at 68, 83).   A very destructive hurricane\n\n3\nstruck the area of his property in 2007.  This storm created supply shortages and\ndelayed construction for almost two years (see ex. H; R.T., at 35, 43-44, 79).  Unable to\ndevelop the property, Applicant suspended all work in November 2007.  At the time,\ncreditor 1.a had disbursed only $64,000.00 of its approved $240,435.00 loan proceeds\nto Applicant.  This $64,000.00 disbursement represented the amount of loan funds\nallocated by creditor 1.a for Applicant\u2019s purchase of the property (R.T., at 82). \nIn November 2007, Applicant replaced the construction loan made to him by\ncreditor 1.a  with a lot loan for $64,615.87 and executed a substitute first mortgage on\nthe property to secure the loan (R.T., at 45, 68-69, 84-86).  Monthly payments on this\nrevised mortgage were $360.00.  Evidently, the mortgage lender\u2019s loan disbursements\nwere just for the purchase of the lot, and did not include any disbursed loan proceeds\nfor construction.  When Applicant converted his construction loan to a reduced loan to\ncover just the $64,000.00 expended for the lot purchase, the lender was able to simply\nrelease Applicant from any responsibility over the approximately $180,000.00 in loan\nproceeds the lender had not disbursed (R.T., at 86-89).\nJust after executing a modified loan and mortgage with creditor 1.a, Applicant\npurchased an adjacent lot in the same real estate complex (see exs. 3 through 5 and\nC).  He obtained $260,000.00 in financing to cover the purchase of the lot and the\nconstruction of the duplex he planned to erect on the property.  Both the lot purchase\nand the proposed construction were appraised at $305,000.00, and were covered ) and\nfinanced his purchase with a loan secured by a first mortgage.  Monthly payments on\nthis loan were $1,720.00 (R.T., at 71).\nFaced with a weakening economy, inability to find renters for his properties, and\nthe lack of money (see ex. 7; R.T., at 79), Applicant ceased making mortgage payments\non both of his State 2 properties in April 2008 (R.T., at 70-71, 78).  Creditor 1.a initiated\njudicial foreclosure proceedings in State 2's circuit court in June 2008 (see ex. G; R.T.,\nat 70).  Court records document that creditor 1.a obtained a final judgment of\nforeclosure in October 2008 after Applicant defaulted on the creditor\u2019s filed complaint\n(see ex. G).  The property was noticed for sale in November 2008 (ex. G). \nApplicant understands that creditor 1.a could obtain a deficiency from the court\nand seek personal liability against him for any entered deficiency following sale of the\nproperty (R.T., at 73, 75-76, 91).  To date, though, he has not been able to find out\nwhether a sale was ever consummated (R.T., at 73, 88).  Creditor 1.a has since been\nseized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Whether or not this bank\nhas returned to business, either in its name or as a spun-off bank from the FDIC, is not\nknown to Applicant (R.T., at 73-74, 91-94).  Applicant believes that creditor 1.a has up\nto a year (from the date of sale) to seek a deficiency (R.T., at 92).  That time has not yet\nexpired.\nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit reports document that creditor 1.b initiated\nforeclosure proceedings in 2008 (see ex. 4).  Applicant assures that he still owns this\nproperty.  He has placed the property for sale and entered into negotiations with the\n\n4\ncreditor to enlist the creditor\u2019s agreement to accept either a short sale or a deed-in-lieu\nof foreclosure on the property (see ex. 7; R.T., at 74-75).  Applicant currently owes\ncreditor 1.b approximately $256,000.00 on his mortgage debt (R.T., at 74).  He reports\nthat the creditor is agreeable in principle to accepting a short sale at a negotiated floor\nprice or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (ex. C).  However, he provides no documentation\nfrom the creditor showing acceptance of either of his proposals. \nCurrent market conditions in the development where Applicant\u2019s completed\nduplex (financed by his first mortgage with creditor 1.b) is located are severely\ndepressed.  Applicant reports that comparable properties in the development are selling\nin the $35,000.00 to $40,000 range (R.T., at 73-75).  While his broker did receive a\nrecent preliminary offer of $55,000.00 for the duplex, Applicant did not express much\nconfidence in completing a sale with this buyer (R.T., at 74, 76).  Lack of domestic\ndemand for real estate in this region is generally attributable to depressed real estate\nand employment conditions in the area (R.T., at 79-80).  Applicant assures that about\n70 per cent of the investment properties in the State 2 development are currently empty\n(R.T., at 80). \nTo date, Applicant has heard nothing back from creditor 1.b regarding its\nforeclosure position, its willingness to accept a short sale with an agreed floor price, or\nwhether it is amenable to accepting a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (R.T., at 76-78).   So,\nat this time there is no formal offer or agreement in place between creditor 1.b and\nApplicant covering either a short sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  Based on current\nmarket conditions in State 2, prospects for creditor 1.b\u2019s agreeing to either option are\nnot good.  For the lender to accept either option would require it to agree with Applicant\nto accept either exceptionally low sale proceeds on a pre-approved short sale or agree\nto a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and waive any deficiency entitlement it might otherwise\nhave to recover its losses (R.T., at 74-75).  Creditor 1.b has provided no tangible\nindications that it is willing to pursue either option with Applicant.\nShould creditor 1.b decline both the short sale and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure\noffers currently in discussion, Applicant\u2019s only other option would be to raise the cash\nnecessary to pay off his $250,000.00 mortgage loan (R.T., at 77).  He does not find this\nlatter option very appealing, or very plausible in his current circumstances.  \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show him to be current with his other debts (see exs. 4,\n5 and 6).  Based on his personal financial statement, Applicant has a current adjusted\nmonthly gross income of around $4,240.00 (compare ex. 7 with R.T., at 52-53).  At the\nmoment, Applicant has $19,000.00 in his 401(k) account and around $10,000.00 in a\nsavings account (R.T., at 65-66).  Recently, he increased his 401(k) retirement\ndeductions to 10 per cent (R.T., at 53).  His wife nets around $1,400.00 a month and\nhas no 401(k) account (R.T., at 54-55).  \nApplicant\u2019s  monthly expenses total around $4,805.00.  His expenses encompass\nrent, groceries, utilities, car bills, life insurance and medical expenses (see ex. 7; R.T.,\nat 55-63).  He owes approximately $7,000.00 on his vehicle and has monthly car\n\n5\nexpenses of $200.00 (ex. 7).  This leaves him with a typical net monthly remainder of\napproximately $962.41 (see ex. 7).  \nApplicant is well regarded by friends of many years who (like Applicant) are\nregular members of Applicant\u2019s church (see ex. D; R.T., at 34-36).  These friends have\nalways found Applicant to be calm, determined, and loyal to the membership in church\naffairs (ex. D; R.T., at 34-35).  These church members hold Applicant in high regard in\nfinancial matters.  His pastor, too, finds Applicant to possess outstanding leadership and\ninterpersonal skills (see ex. D).  He credits Applicant with being diligent, organized and\na self-starter, and recommends him for a position of trust.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E 2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\n\n6\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a well-regarded information technology coordinator for a defense\ncontractor who financed two investment properties in another state, and subsequently,\ndue to unforeseen construction delays and a major real estate downturn in the state,\nsimultaneously defaulted on his two loans.  By defaulting, he  exposed himself to judicial\nforeclosure of both properties, and ensuing deficiency claims by the respective creditors.\nWithout resolution, these two major debts have the potential to expose Applicant to\ndeficiency liability and raise security concerns over the potential of future Applicant\ndefaults.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines\u00b6 DC 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to construction delays and an ensuing\nmajor downturn in real estate market conditions in his region. Together, these problems\nprevented him from completing construction on one of  the properties (creditor 1.a) and\nreselling both of them without incurring major losses.  When rental and resale prospects\n\n7\nin the relevant development area collapsed in 2008, Applicant ceased paying on both\nproperties. \nRecords show that creditor 1.a initiated and completed judicial foreclosure\nproceedings in State 2 without any appearance from Applicant.  Creditor 1.a obtained a\nfinal judgment by default in October 2008.  Whether this judgment includes a deficiency\nentitlement or not is unknown.  While Applicant expressed an opinion that he believed\nthe creditor could pursue a deficiency in one year, he did not provide a copy of the\njudgment or any court orders to that effect.  Exploration of State 2 law confirms the\navailability of a deficiency in foreclosure cases initiated in the state.\nState 2 makes judicial foreclosure the sole remedy for a lender seeking to\nforeclose on a defaulted mortgage.  Unlike some states (mostly in the West), State 1\ndoes not provide for alternative non-judicial foreclosures.  By virtue of Chapter 702.06 of\nState 2's statutes, all mortgages are governed by the state\u2019s judicial foreclosure law.  Its\nlong arm procedures permit joinder of out of state residents by substituted service and\nprogression to judgment by default. \nOnce the foreclosed property at issue in a particular case is sold at public auction\nfor less than the value of the mortgage, the creditor may seek a deficiency claim in two\nways.  Where the creditor includes a deficiency claim in its complaint, and the entered\nforeclosure judgment includes a right to a deficiency, the foreclosing creditor may move\nthe court retaining jurisdiction over the case for a personal deficiency within one year of\nthe foreclosure sale.  See Chapter 702.06 and Chrestensen v. Eurogest, 906 So. 2d 343,\n345n.2 (App. 2005).  Where, however, neither the complaint nor the final judgment\ninclude a deficiency claim or entitlement, the foreclosing creditor who is not made whole\nby the ensuing foreclosure sale may seek a deficiency by a separate lawsuit.  The\ncreditor in this instance has five years to seek an independent deficiency judgment.  \u00a7\n95.01 of State 2 Stat.; see Chrestensen v. Eurogest, supra.  The five year time limit for\nsuch complaints runs from the date of the foreclosure sale, and not from when the\ncomplaint was filed, or the judgment of foreclosure was entered.  See Chapter 702.06 of\nState 1's statutes and Chrestensen v. Eurogest (citing Singleton v. Greymar Assocs.,\n882 So. 2d 1004 (App. 2004), supra.\nWhether creditor 1.a preserved a deficiency entitlement in its foreclosure\njudgment can not be discerned without examination of the judgment itself.  Even if an\nentitlement was preserved, it is not known whether creditor 1.a\u2019s sale of its foreclosed\nfirst trust deed produced sufficient sale proceeds to cover its $64,000 mortgage on the\nproperty.  Given the depressed state of real estate conditions in this particular region of\nState 2, it seems very unlikely that creditor 1.a was made whole from the sale.  If this is\nthe case, creditor 1.a has legal options for pursuing a deficiency, depending on what its\nfinal foreclosure judgment provides for.\nCreditor 1.b\u2019s $256,000.00 first mortgage on Applicant\u2019s completed duplex\npresents equally significant deficiency risks for Applicant.  At the present, Applicant is still\nin possession of this former property and continues to negotiate with the creditor over a\n\n8\nshort sale and/or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  Creditor 1.b\u2019s acceptance\nof either option from Applicant would require a settlement agreement with Applicant and\nforgiveness of any deficiency claim should the property fail to produce enough in sale to\nsatisfy its mortgage-backed loan on the property.   See J. Murray, Deeds in Lieu of\nForeclosure: Practical and Legal Consequences, 26 Real Prop. Prob. &Tr. J., 459, 516\n(1991).\n Considering the depressed state of prices in the development complex of\nApplicant\u2019s properties in State 2 and the significant price differential extant between what\nthe creditor 1.b property can realistically bring on the open market and the mortgage\nbalance, existing conditions are not very promising for achieving any positive outcome\nfor Applicant from his current negotiations with creditor 1.b.  Whether creditor 1.b has\nalready initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings in State 2 is not known.  Applicant\nremains at high risk, though, to this creditor\u2019s initiating foreclosure proceedings, obtaining\na judgment of foreclosure, and then seeking a deficiency (either as an ancillary claim in\nits foreclosure suit or through an independent action) against Applicant for the balance\nowing after the public sale of the property under the court\u2019s supervision.\nAfter judgment and sale of the property covered by the final foreclosure judgment,\nState 2 permits the foreclosing creditor to seek a deficiency judgment in personam, and\nenables the creditor to then register its judgment in the respondent\u2019s state of residence\nand pursue enforcement action there.  Both the stakes and risks associated with creditor\n1.b\u2019s securing a deficiency judgment against Applicant are considerable and cannot be\ndiscounted under current market conditions in State 2.  To be sure, these risk\nassessments are not made on the basis of perfect foresight.  They are best estimates\nbased on the past history in the region of Applicant\u2019s properties, current market\nconditions in the region, and some evaluation of Applicant\u2019s risk exposure under real\nestate conditions that are likely to persist for the foreseeable future.  \nBased on his evidentiary showing, extenuating circumstances certainly\ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s inability to resolve his two mortgage obligations in State 2.  A\nconfluence of construction delays, falling prices, and a poor rental market hampered his\nability to service either of his two real estate mortgages in State 2.  Available to Applicant\nis \u00b6 MC 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility.\u201d  While judgment problems persist over Applicant\u2019s lack of\ncorroborated due diligence efforts preceding his investment purchases in a still\nunderdeveloped area of State 2, they are extenuated somewhat by unforeseen post-\npurchase construction delays and deteriorating market conditions in the region.\nIn recognition of the modest constructive efforts Applicant has made to resolve his\ncreditor 1.b mortgage with a negotiated short sale and/or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in\nthe wake of depressing real estate conditions in State 2, some mitigation credit is\navailable to him.  Age of the two still unresolved debts (creditors 1.a and 1.b) is covered\nby two of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations: \u00b6 MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\n\n9\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d and \u00b6 MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Although neither mitigating condition is\ndispositive, they  do have some limited application to Applicant\u2019 situation.  \n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment permits extenuation and some mitigation of Applicant\u2019s\naccumulated delinquent mortgage debts.  Extenuating circumstances associated with\nconstruction delays on his creditor 1.a mortgage and overall depressed market\nconditions associated with both State 2 properties temporarily impaired his ability to meet\nhis financial obligations with his creditor 1.a and 1.b lenders.\nWhile it would be unfair to impose 20/20 hindsight on Applicant in this case,\njudgment lapses do play some role in Applicant\u2019s situation.  Considering the location of\nthese properties and his failure to move more aggressively to resell the properties and\navert foreclosures and potentially major deficiency liabilities relative to the properties,\nApplicant can be faulted some on his failure to use more due diligence before\nproceeding with his investments in State 2.  Where real estate investment decisions are\ninvolved, the Appeal Board has always stressed due diligence and aggressive debt\nresolution efforts in appraising the adequacy of an applicant\u2019s mitigation steps in\nextricating himself from poor real estate investment decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 07-\n16841, at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008). \nManifestly, there are considerable questions about (a) the adequacy of Applicant\u2019s\ninquiries into the viability of his investment properties in a state far from his place of\nresidence and (b) the strength of his efforts to avert the loss of his State 2 properties in a\ndeteriorating real estate market.  Compounding Applicant\u2019s judgment questions are the\nmajor security risks that pertain to his continued high exposure to major deficiency\nobligations with both creditors.  These risks are simply too high to be safely mitigated at\nthis time.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s two mortgage debt accumulations and the risks of deficiency liability that is\nstill extant, he fails to mitigate judgment, reliability and trustworthiness concerns related\nto his debts.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nthe financial considerations guideline.\n\n10\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  Clearance is denied.\n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

She denied\nthe remaining allegations. She is a 26-year-old financial analyst employed by a defense\ncontractor since June 2008, seeking access to classified information. She has not\npreviously held a clearance. She is a single mother of two children who receives some\nfinancial support from both fathers.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 8 delinquent debts\ntotaling over $26,000.

He did\nnot do so and the three debts Applicant admits are for the defaulted first and second\nmortgages and an unpaid electric bill. The mortgage company eventually foreclosed on\nthe house. Applicant received notice from the mortgage company of a February 2009\nforeclosure sale, but has not learned whether there is any deficiency balance for which\nshe may be responsible.\nApplicant denied the debts at SOR 1.c. and 1.d. because she paid them in March\n2009 (A.E. G), after she received the SOR. She denied the remaining debts either\nbecause she did not recognize them, could not find them on the credit report she\nobtained on-line, or believed them to be in dispute for several years. However, she\nbased these conclusions on only one credit reporting agency. She purported to be\nunaware that there were three major credit reporting agencies.  Nevertheless, on 12\n3\nJune 2009\u2014three days after her hearing\u2014she entered a debt consolidation program\nthat obligates her to pay approximately $200 per month for the next 22 two months to\nresolve the four remaining non-mortgage debts alleged in the SOR as well as five other\ndelinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR. She is to make payments by direct debit\nfrom her checking account beginning in late June 2009.\nApplicant was aware of her delinquent mortgages in July 2008 when she\ncompleted her clearance application (G.E. 1). She was aware of the government\u2019s\nconcerns about her delinquent accounts when she answered DOHA interrogatories in\nJanuary 2009 (G.E. 3). She took little action to resolve her debts until she received the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n3\nSOR in February 2009, despite the fact that she showed positive monthly cash flow of\nover $1,600 on a January 2009 personal financial statement (G.E. 3).\nApplicant received an excellent character reference from her supervisor, who is\naware of her financial problems (A.E. A). She has received one promotion since joining\nthe company in June 2008, and expects another soon. She currently makes about\n$46,000 per year. She received an excellent employment evaluation from her employer\n(A.E. B). She also received two excellent recommendations for admission to a local\nuniversity in May 2009 (A.E. C). She moved to a new apartment to lower her rent\nexpenses (A.E. D). She attempted to refinance her mortgages in December 2008 (G.E.\n3), but that application was denied in January 2009 (A.E. E) because of her history of\ninsufficient fund checks with the lender. She has been taking several course at a local\ncommunity college to improve her education (A.E. F).\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\n\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n5\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n8\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n,\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties beginning in January 2008.  Although Applicant has taken steps to address\n5\nher non-mortgage debt, she did not do so until after she received the SOR. While she is\non firmer financial footing today, she has not reached a stage where her goal of\nfinancial stability seems assured.\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide mixed help to\nApplicant. Her financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts she admitted\n6\nmay reasonably be considered largely due to circumstances beyond her\ncontrol\u2014setting aside the judgment issues of not having a written agreement with her\nex-fianc\u00e9 regarding responsibility for house-related expenses. However, she knew\nenough about the legal consequences of being a joint owner on the house and electric\naccount. She has not been completely responsible overall in addressing these three\ndebts, and the final resolution of the mortgages has not been documented.  She\n7\nappears to have the financial means to resolve the nine delinquent debts she\nconsolidated in June 2009, but this belated arrangement does not fully demonstrate\nthat the problem has been brought substantially under control.  Further, there is no\n8\nevidence that Applicant has undertaken financial counseling. None of the debts that\nhave been paid were paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  She may now have the means\n9\nto get and keep her financial house in order, pending documentation of any remaining\nmortgage liability. Nevertheless, she has yet to provide documentation that she has\nmade the first payment under her debt consolidation program, or establish a track\nrecord of regular payments. The best case view of Applicant\u2019s circumstances is that it is\nstill too early to tell whether her goal of financial stability will be achieved. I conclude\nGuideline F against Applicant. Analysis of the whole person factors requires no different\nresult.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

The record evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of drug abuse during the period of 1985\u20132006, when he used\ncrack cocaine and marijuana, although his drug of choice was crack cocaine. Some of\nhis drug abuse took place while he held a security clearance. Due to his cocaine use,\nhe went through drug treatment programs twice, the first time in 1985 and the second in\n2006. He has not used cocaine since completing the program in 2006. Applicant did not\nprovide full, frank, and candid answers to questions about his drug abuse during the\nsecurity clearance process. There is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained in further detail below, this\ncase is decided against Applicant.\nJune 22, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit C. \n2\n Exhibits A and B. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 9,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline H for drug involvement and Guideline E for personal conduct. The\nSOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to decide\nwhether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me February 22, 2019. The hearing took place April 5, 2010. The\nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received April 13, 2010.  \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 72-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been married\nto the same woman for more than 50 years, and he has five children (all adults) and\neight grandchildren. There are no minor children living in his household.\nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes a 23-year period when he worked for a\ntire manufacturing company, for which he is entitled to a pension.  More recently, he\n2\nhas worked as a security guard or access control specialist from 1998 to present. His\nrecent job performance has been good.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance\n3\npreviously granted to him in 2004 or sooner. \nApplicant has a history of drug abuse. He used both crack cocaine and\nmarijuana, although his drug of choice was crack cocaine. Some of his drug abuse took\nplace while he held a security clearance. Due to his cocaine use, he went through drug\ntreatment programs twice, the first time in 1985 and the second in 2006. He has not\nused any illegal drugs since he completed the program in 2006. After completing\n\n Exhibit 3. \n4\n Exhibits 1 and 2. \n5\n Exhibit 2. \n6\n Exhibit 1. \n7\n Exhibit 3. \n8\n3\ntreatment, he attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA) on a regular basis for about two\nyears. Since about mid-2008, he has not attended NA, but is actively involved with his\nchurch where his spouse is quite active as well.  \nThe best evidence of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse is likely the records from the drug\ntreatment program he attended in 2006.  Those records, which are based on\n4\ninformation he provided at that time, show he was admitted and discharged with a\ndiagnosis of cocaine dependence. The records show Applicant was seeking help for his\ncrack cocaine use problem. And the records show he reported the following about his\npast drug use: (1) he first used crack cocaine about 20 years ago; (2) he abstained for\nabout three years after going through a 21-day inpatient program in 1985; (3) he\ntypically binged in a pattern of $200 to $300 worth of crack cocaine over two to three\ndays, and then he might go for two to three months without using; (4) his last use of\ncrack cocaine was about one week before admission; and (5) he smoked marijuana for\na period of four years about ten years ago, but had not used any in six years. \nApplicant completed security clearance applications on at least two occasions.5\nHe first completed an application in November 1997.  In response to Question 24a,\n6\nApplicant answered in the negative thereby denying the use of any illegal drug (to\ninclude marijuana and cocaine) within the last seven years.\nHe completed the second application in June 2008.  In response to 24a,\n7\nApplicant answered in the affirmative and reported the occasional use of crack cocaine\nduring the estimated period of June 2000 to June 2006. He also reported the successful\ncompletion of the drug treatment program in 2006. He did not, however, answer in the\naffirmative in response to Question 24b, which asks about illegal drug use while\npossessing a security clearance. \nApplicant was interviewed by a governmental investigator in July 2008. The\nresults of that interview were summarized by the investigator and included in a report of\ninvestigation.  The summary of the interview indicates Applicant began using crack\n8\ncocaine in June 2000, when he started experimenting with the drug at the suggestion of\na friend. There is no indication in the summary that he mentioned any cocaine use\ntaking place before 2000.  \n\n Exhibit 4. \n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n10\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n12\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n13\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n14\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n4\nThe Agency required Applicant to respond to interrogatories about his past drug\nuse.  In response to Question 1, which asked Applicant to disclose if he had used any\n9\nnarcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, and cannabis (to include marijuana and\nhashish) except as prescribed by a medical doctor, Applicant responded in the\naffirmative and reported the occasional use of crack cocaine, the last of which took\nplace in June 2006. He did not report any marijuana use. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. Moreover, the Department\nof Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n10\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n11\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n12\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n13\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  Department Counsel has the burden of presenting\n14\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n15\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n19\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n20\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, and 26 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n21\n AG \u00b6 24. \n22\n AG \u00b6 24(b). \n23\n5\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n16\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n17\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.18\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.19\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n20\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline H,  the security concern for drug involvement is as follows:\n21\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.   \n22\nDrug abuse means \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d23\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy history of drug abuse raises serious security concerns. He\nengaged in drug abuse when he used marijuana and crack cocaine over a 20-year\n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), (d), and (g).\n24\n AG \u00b6 26(a) \u2013 (d).\n25\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n26\n6\nperiod (1985\u20132006), although his drug of choice was crack cocaine. He twice sought\ntreatment for his dependency, the first in 1985, which was successful for about three\nyears, and the second in 2006, which has been successful to date. Some of his drug\nabuse took place while he held a security clearance granted to him by the Defense\nDepartment. Taken together, these circumstances raise security concerns under\nseveral disqualifying conditions.  \n24\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns.  I considered all the mitigating conditions and the most pertinent here are:\n25\n\u2022\nA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany  violation. \n\u2022\nSatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not\nlimited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse,\nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nApplicant receives credit under both of these conditions. It appears that the drug\ntreatment program in 2006 was successful and it is unlikely that Applicant will relapse at\nthis point in time. On balance, however, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient\nto prevail. In reaching this conclusion, I gave substantial weight to the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of his drug abuse over a 20-year period and the concomitant security\nconcerns. Using crack cocaine while in possession of a security clearance raises\nserious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment, and it reflects poorly on his fitness and suitability for access to classified\ninformation. In addition, his falsifications, as discussed below, undermine his evidence\nof reform and rehabilitation. Accordingly, Guideline H is decided against Applicant. \nTurning to personal conduct under Guideline E,  it includes issues of false\n26\nstatements and credible adverse information that may not be enough to support action\nunder any other guideline. The overall concern is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\n\n AG \u00b6 15. \n27\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (b).\n28\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n29\n7\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n27\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to questions about his\ndrug abuse. I am not persuaded that Applicant gave a deliberately false answer to\nQuestion 24b on his June 2008 security clearance application (after all, he gave an\naffirmative response to Question 24a, the immediate preceding question). But the\nrecord does support a conclusion that Applicant did not give full, frank, and candid\nanswers about his drug abuse when he completed his November 1997 security\nclearance application, during an interview in July 2008, and when answering\ninterrogatories in December 2008. Applicant\u2019s explanations to the contrary are not\ncredible.  \nThe established falsifications support application of two disqualifying conditions\nthat address the deliberate falsification of relevant facts during the security clearance\nprocess.  I reviewed all the potential mitigating conditions under the guideline and\n28\nconclude none apply. Making false or misleading statements to the federal government\nduring the security clearance process is serious misconduct. It is not easily explained\naway, excused, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug abuse\nand his falsifications justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the\nwhole-person concept  and I considered all of Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, which\n29\nwas not insubstantial. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain\na favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.b\u20132.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on July 10,\n2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 22, 2009.

Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nGE 1; Tr. 22-26.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 29.\n3\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request on August 10, 2009. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on September 18, 2009, and I received the case assignment on\nOctober 8, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 19, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on November 3, 2009. The government offered five\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection.\nApplicant and one witness testified. He submitted three exhibits (AE) A through C,\nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on November 12, 2009. I held the record open until December 2, 2009\nfor Applicant to submit additional matters. He timely submitted seven Exhibits, AE D\nthrough AE J, which are admitted without objection. The record closed on December 2,\n2009.\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not know when he received the\nhearing notice. (Tr. 9.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to\n15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c\nand 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\nand 1.e of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for\n1\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 34 years old, works as an ECS Technician for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He began his current employment in September 2007. His\nsupervisor hired him because Applicant was highly recommended. He considered\nApplicant an outstanding and knowledgeable employee. He described Applicant as a\ntrustworthy, honest, and reliable person, who strived to do the best. Applicant has not\nhad any disciplinary issues.2\nApplicant became a father in July 1993, while still in high school. He graduated\nhigh school in 1994. He attended trade school, where he learned air conditioning skills.\nApplicant married in 2001 and anticipates the birth of a daughter in January 2010.    \n3\n\nAE G; AE I; Tr. 29, 40-41. \n4\nGE 3; Tr. 29-30.\n5\nGE 3; Tr. 30-31, 37-38.\n6\nApplicant provided copies of eight leave and earnings statements from September 11, 2009 through\n7\nNovember 6, 2009. These statements indicated that his actual monthly wage declined from $32.80 in\nSeptember 2009 to $26.76 an hour in October 2009 and increased to $33.11 an hour for the first paycheck\nin November 2009. He earns overtime regularly, but not every pay period. His overtime rate of pay depends\nupon his base rate of pay. AE I.\nAE I.\n8\n3\nAfter Applicant\u2019s son was born in 1993, he provided money for his son\u2019s support\nwithout any defined agreement. When his son was five years old, Applicant obtained a\ncourt order for specific monthly support. Applicant regularly paid approximately $330 a\nmonth in child support and his arrearage. In the summer of 2009, Applicant obtained\ncustody of his 16-year-old son, who now lives with him. Child support is still being\nwithheld from his paycheck. He is working to correct this problem.   \n4\nApplicant and his wife purchased a small house in 2002 for approximately\n$80,000. In 2004, when the market value of the house increased, he refinanced the\nhouse for $120,000, using the equity to pay other debts. His new monthly mortgage\npayment was $900. In 2004, two hurricanes damaged his home. His house sustained\nminimal damage from the first hurricane, but the damage from the second hurricane\ntotaled almost $20,000. His insurance company paid $10,000 for the damage. He\nobtained a loan for $7,000 for house repairs. He used his own funds to pay the\nremaining repair costs, which he performed. If he delayed the house repairs, he and his\nwife would be required to live with his parents.5\nIn 2007, two events impacted his ability to afford his house. His works hours at\nhis then-employer declined. Based on the booming real estate market, the State\nassessed his home value at $180,000, leading to a significant increase in his real estate\ntaxes and insurance premiums. His monthly payment increased from $900 a month to\n$1,400 a month. He could not afford the $500 monthly increase. He tried unsuccessfully\nto work with his mortgagor. When he could not make his monthly payments, he tried to\nsell his house. He failed and the mortgagor foreclosed in 2008.  \n6\nApplicant\u2019s current hourly rate of pay varies each month, but has increased $10\nan hour since he began his current employment.  He also regularly earns overtime at\n7\nhis current job. Applicant\u2019s net monthly pay in September and October 2009 averaged\n$5,700 with overtime. Without his overtime earnings, his monthly net income would\naverage around $3,000. His wife works part-time, and her net monthly income averages\n$850 a month.8\nApplicant developed a budget based on his expenses for September 2009 and\nOctober 2009. His monthly expenses average $3,100. His budget does not include child\n\nAE D; AE E; AE H; Tr. 47.\n9\nBecause the bank continued the closing date on Applicant\u2019s house until November 30, 2009, on or about\n10\nJanuary 23, 2010, I conducted a telephone conference with Applicant and Department Counsel concerning\nthe status of Applicant\u2019s discussions with the bank and his mortgage debt. He advised that the settlement of\nhis house occurred in mid-December and that he was resolving his debt issues with the bank. I requested\nadditional information regarding the status of his loan, but I have not received any information.\nGE 2, p.11; AE D; Tr. 32.\n11\nAE F; Tr. 31-32, 37-38.\n12\nGE 3; GE 4; GE 5.\n13\n4\ncare expenses if his wife returns to work after the birth of his daughter. He had $5,500\nin savings at the time of the hearing. On November 30, 2009, he opened a separate\nsavings account and deposited $4,500 of his savings in this account. He designated this\nmoney specifically for payment of his mortgage debt, discussed infra. He plans to apply\nhis overtime earnings to the payment of his mortgage debt. His monthly truck payment\nwill be completed in October 2010 and he plans to also use this money towards\nrepayment of his mortgage debt.9\nWhen his bank foreclosed on his house in 2008, the bank obtained title to his\nproperty. In December 2008, Applicant inquired about the amount owed on his\nmortgage loan. The bank advised that he owed the amount shown on his credit report,\n$122,841. The bank also advised that this amount would adjust once the proceeds from\nthe sale of his house had been applied. The bank sold Applicant\u2019s house in October\n2009 and scheduled the closing for October 31, 2009. The closing date changed to\nNovember 30, 2009. At the close of the record, the bank had not yet settled on the\nresale of his house.10\nApplicant offered to make payments on his mortgage debt several times. In his\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant indicated that in August 2009, he had reached an\nagreement to pay the bank $200 a month on his mortgage and loan debts. This\nagreement was not finalized. The bank acknowledged his offers at resolving his debts in\na letter dated November 9, 2009. It further advised that it could not develop payment\narrangements with Applicant until the property sold and the actual deficiency balance is\ndetermined.  Applicant\u2019s unpaid $7,000 loan, in allegation 1.c, will be included in the\n11\nmortgage repayment plan.12\nWhen Applicant met with the investigator in September 2008, the investigator\nreviewed Applicant\u2019s 11 unpaid debts, many of which Applicant acknowledged. The July\n2008 credit report, on which the investigator relied, reflected nine past due or collection\naccounts, including his mortgage and a $7,000 loan. The investigator also reviewed two\nbank loans in the amounts of $15,000 and $16,000 with him. Applicant did not\nrecognize the two loans. Both credit reports in the record reflect two paid automobile\nloans with the bank, but do not show two unpaid loans. The SOR does not contain any\nallegations on the $15,000 and $16,000 debts.13\n\nResponse to SOR and attachments; GE 2; GE 4; AE C; Tr. 50.\n14\nResponse to SOR; AE A; AE B; Tr. 24-25.\n15\n5\nApplicant told the investigator that he planned to pay the smaller debts within the\nyear. Interrogatories mailed to Applicant in late 2008 identified nine debts. Applicant\nprovided information showing payment arrangements on five small accounts. He also\naddressed the status of his mortgage debt. Since December 2008, Applicant has paid\nall his small debts, including the three debts listed in the SOR (allegations 1.a, 1.b, and\n1.e). His current bills are paid and are not in arrears.14\nCo-workers, friends, and his pastor recommend Applicant for a security\nclearance. They describe him as trustworthy and hardworking. His co-workers opine\nthat he is a man of integrity and is dependable and unselfish. He has told his supervisor\nand several co-workers about his financial issues.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, that he was unable to pay.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nIn assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,\nthe Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. BD. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. BD. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\n\n7\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See,\ne.g.,ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2(App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nGuideline F also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose\nin 2004 and continue to the present. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose, in part, when a hurricane damaged his home and insurance failed to\nprovide sufficient money to repair his home. He chose to repair his home so that he and\nhis wife could live in their home and not with his parents. Because of this decision, he\ncould not pay all his bills. When the State assessed the value of his house at $180,000\nin 2007, which resulted in a $500 increase in his monthly mortgage payment, Applicant\ncould not pay it, in part due to a decline in his work hours. He tried to sell his house.\nWhen he could not, he had no choice but to allow it to go to foreclosure. I find this\npotentially mitigating condition is partially applicable as the hurricane, the sudden $500\nincrease in his monthly mortgage payment, and loss of work hours were conditions\nbeyond his control. In addition, he tried to sell his house, a reasonable action under the\ncircumstances. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling; however, he\nhas developed a sound budget to manage his finances. His monthly bills are current.\nWhen the investigator provided him with information about his outstanding debts,\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and (f) are not applicable in this case.\n16\n8\nApplicant indicated he would begin work on resolving the debts and did so in 2008. He\nresolved his seven smaller debts by July 31, 2009. He attempted to resolve his two\nlarger debts with the bank, and thought he had done so. The bank, however, has not\ncooperated with him, and has acknowledged that it would not develop a payment plan\nuntil the sale of Applicant\u2019s house finalized. He is still working on a payment plan. I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply to allegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e,\nand have some applicability to allegations 1.c and 1.d.16\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is substantial but not determinative. In reaching a conclusion, I\nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s debts arose after his house\nsustained significant damage from a hurricane in 2004, his mortgage increased by $500\nwhen his property value escalated, and his work hours declined. His attempt to sell his\nhouse was unsuccessful, as real estate sales declined. He paid his smaller debts as\npromised and set aside money for making his mortgage loan repayment once the debt\nis determined. Applicant is moving in the right direction, but has not yet shown that he\n\n9\nhas actually resolved the two large remaining debts. He failed to provide the requested\ninformation about his debt resolution with the bank and has not explained why.\nApplicant needs more time to show what he has done with his mortgage and bank loan.\nShould he develop and comply with a repayment plan, he is eligible to reapply for his\nclearance in a year.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.i, and the bankruptcy allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k (GE 11). Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr2. 6, 26). He is currently a security guard 33 hours per week (Tr2. 27-28). He has previously held an interim security clearance (Tr2. 28). He received his high school diploma in 1996 and has completed two years of college (Tr2. 6-7). He majored in business administration in college (Tr2. 7, 26). He does not have any prior military experience (Tr2. 29). He has never married (Tr2. 31; GE 1). His children are ages 11 and six (Tr2. 31-32; GE 1). He disclosed one alcohol or drug offense, a DUI in 2000, as well as attendance at an Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (GE 1). 1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

He earned $25,000 in 2005, $46,000 in 2006, $4,200 in 2007, and $36,834 in 2008 (Tr2. 55; AE G at 3). Applicant has the following financial issues listed in his SOR: SOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,056 owed to a credit union on a credit card account). Applicant set up a payment arrangement to provide $50 monthly starting June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 3",

Applicant failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Personal conduct concerns regarding his filing an \ninaccurate security clearance application with the government are mitigated. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 10), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nJuly 15, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 11). On March 23, \n2009, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On March 25, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me. On April 10, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (Transcript1 (Tr2.) 5). \nAn initial hearing was held on April 28, 2009 (Tr1. 1-9). Applicant requested a delay to \ndetermine whether to hire counsel, and I approved a delay until May 26, 2009 (Tr1. 7-8). \nAt the hearing held on May 26, 2009, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE \n1-7) (Transcript (Tr2.) 19-20), and Applicant offered seven exhibits (Tr2. 22-24; AE A-\nG). Applicant objected to consideration of the government exhibits because, \u201cI did my \npaperwork wrong and I submitted something that was old, not\u2014it was my fault. I \nshouldn\u2019t have [done] that.\u201d I will apply Applicant\u2019s comments to the weight I give GE 1-\n7. GE 1-7 were admitted (Tr2. 20). Department Counsel did not object to my \nconsideration of AE A-G, and I admitted them (Tr2. 24). Additionally, I admitted the \nNotice of Hearing, Amended Hearing Notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 8-11). \nI received the transcript on June 2, 2009. I held the record open until June 5, 2009 for \npotential submission of additional evidence (Tr2. 61, 76). On June 2, 2009, I received \none post-hearing exhibit, which was admitted without objection as AE H.    \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.i, and the bankruptcy allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k (GE 11). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr2. 6, 26). He is \ncurrently a security guard 33 hours per week (Tr2. 27-28). He has previously held an \ninterim security clearance (Tr2. 28). He received his high school diploma in 1996 and \nhas completed two years of college (Tr2. 6-7). He majored in business administration in \ncollege (Tr2. 7, 26). He does not have any prior military experience (Tr2. 29). He has \nnever married (Tr2. 31; GE 1). His children are ages 11 and six (Tr2. 31-32; GE 1). He \ndisclosed one alcohol or drug offense, a DUI in 2000, as well as attendance at an \nAlcohol and Substance Abuse Program (GE 1).    \n \n \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from April to August 2003, from January to April 2005 \nand from November 2008 to April 2009 (Tr2. 30-31; GE 1). He earned $25,000 in 2005, \n$46,000 in 2006, $4,200 in 2007, and $36,834 in 2008 (Tr2. 55; AE G at 3).  \n  \n \nApplicant has the following financial issues listed in his SOR: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,056 owed to a credit union on a credit card account). Applicant set \nup a payment arrangement to provide $50 monthly starting June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 39; AE \nA);  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,253 owed on his child support debt). He disclosed the \ngarnishment of his pay to pay child support beginning in August 2001 (GE 1). As of May \n2009, he owed $5,720 (Tr2. 34; AE D). He learned the government would garnish half \nof his unemployment pay, if he did not begin making his child support payments (Tr2. \n34-35). He has been making weekly payments of $170 for the last two months (Tr2. 34-\n35);  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($37,564 owed on his mortgage of $326,000). His mortgage became \ndelinquent in November 2008 (Tr2. 41). He discussed renegotiation or loan modification \nof his mortgage with assistance from another mortgage company (Tr2. 41-42). \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two uncles live in his residence with Applicant (Tr2. 42). His \nmother sorts mail at a private company, one uncle waits tables and the other uncle \nworks for a lawn service during the day, and a pizza company at night (Tr2. 42-43). His \ntwo uncles and his mother are supposed to pay $500 each a month and Applicant is \nsupposed to pay the remainder (Tr2. 43). His monthly mortgage payment is currently \n$2,500 a month (Tr2. 43). The most recent payment was four or five months ago when \nApplicant sent in $1,500 (Tr2. 44). The last time he paid $2,500 was probably in \nNovember 2008 (Tr2. 44). On April 10, 2009, he began working with a new company to \nmodify his mortgage (AE C). He believed the new mortgage payment would be $1,500 \nper month (Tr2. 45); \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e ($2,557 and $2,551 owed on his student loans). Applicant\u2019s \nstudent loans went into default status in November 2008 (Tr2. 46). On May 20, 2009, he \nset up an arrangement to pay the creditor $100 per month (Tr2. 46; AE B). His first \npayment is due June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 46);  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($8,006 owed on Applicant\u2019s BMW car loan of $50,533). In July 2007, \nhe traded in his Mercedes and bought a BMW (Tr2. 47, 53-54; GE 2). He financed \n$42,000 and contracted to make $800 monthly payments (Tr2. 47). He stopped making \npayments in March 2008 (Tr2. 54; GE 2; GE 3). He called the creditor and told them to \npick up his BMW in April 2009 (Tr2. 47-48). He was unaware about the amount of his \ndebt because the creditor needed to sell his car before a balance owed could be \ndetermined (Tr2. 49);  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($6,284 owed to a credit union on a credit card account). Applicant set \nup a payment arrangement to provide $50 monthly starting June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 39; AE \nA); \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($533 owed on a lien for unpaid child support). Applicant said this \ndebt is paid (Tr2. 32-37); however, he did not provide any proof of payment. He thought \nit was taken out of his pay (Tr2. 37);  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($212 judgment owed on a hospital bill). Applicant was working for his \nemployer and was hurt on the job (Tr2. 50-51). He thought his employer should pay his \nmedical bill (Tr2. 51). The hospital obtained a judgment against Applicant (Tr2. 51; GE \n6);   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j (Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed on October 25, 2007, and dismissed on \nApril 18, 2008) (AE E). Applicant was unemployed and filed the bankruptcy to stop the \nforeclosure on his residence (Tr2. 52). He filed for the bankruptcy pro se and some \ndocumentation was incorrect (Tr2. 52). This bankruptcy was dismissed because of \nerroneous documentation (Tr2. 52); \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k (Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed on June 4, 2008, and dismissed on \nDecember 17, 2008) (AE E). Applicant filed because he was unemployed and wanted to \nstop the foreclosure on his residence (Tr2. 52-53). A mortgage renegotiation company \nadvised Applicant to dismiss the bankruptcy and they would help him save his \nresidence (Tr2. 52). \n \n \nApplicant also owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $1,699 (Tr2. 69-70). He \nplans to arrange a payment plan with the IRS (Tr2. 69-70). Applicant\u2019s state taxes are \ncurrent (Tr2. 70).   \n \n \nApplicant paid a judgment on October 3, 2006, which was filed on November 14, \n2002 (AE F). He planned to pay off his credit cards, get his mortgage caught up, and \nthen pay for his car and student loans (Tr2. 67-68). His bottom line is that he planned to \npay or resolve all of his debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) was provided as part of his \nbankruptcy filing (Schedule J) and is substantially accurate (Tr2. 63; GE 3). However, at \nthe time he completed the Schedule J in 2008 he held two jobs and his income was \n$4,433 (Tr2. 64; GE 3). Now he only has one part-time job (Tr2. 64). His PFS indicates \n$3,971 in expenses (GE 3). His remainder is $462 (GE 3). Applicant has about $100 in \nchecking and does not have a savings account (Tr2. 65). He does not own a car and \ndoes not have any credit cards (Tr2. 66). He received credit counseling as part of the \nbankruptcy process (Tr2. 66). He learned about saving money and budgeting as well as \nsetting and accomplishing goals (Tr2. 66-67).  \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFalsification of Security Clearance Application \n \nApplicant signed his security clearance applicant on March 21, 2008. In regard to \nhis financial record, and bankruptcy filings Applicant was asked three questions. \nApplicant incorrectly responded, \u201cNo\u201d to questions 27a, 28a and 28b (GE 1), which \nasked: \n \nSection 27: Your Financial Record \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any chapter of the \nbankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)? \n \nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)? \n \nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application contains the following admonition: \n \nCertification That My Answers Are True \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(emphasis in original) (GE 1). Immediately below this admonition is Applicant\u2019s \nsignature.  \n \nApplicant did not contest that he filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on October 25, \n2007, and it was still pending when he submitted this SF-86 (Tr2. 58). He explained at \nhis hearing that he applied for a job before he filed for bankruptcy (Tr2. 57). Later he \nsaid that he used the information from his 2003 security clearance application and just \ncopied it for his March 21, 2008 SF-86 (Tr2. 59). He gave his old security clearance \napplication to his employer, and they used it to type up his March 21, 2008, SF-86 (Tr2. \n75). He agrees he was negligent because he rushed through his paperwork, and failed \nto check it thoroughly (Tr2. 71). He was \u201ctrying to get a job [and he] wasn\u2019t thinking \nabout that\u201d (Tr2. 60). However, the 2003 and 2008 SF-86s are not identical as his 2008 \nSF-86 includes updated employment information from 2005, 2006 and 2007 (GE 1).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant\u2019s April 3, 2008, credit report (GE 2) (obtained shortly after he signed his \nSF-86) lists $11,957 past due on his mortgage, approximately $5,000 past due on his \neducation loans, approximately $12,000 past due on his two credit union-issued credit \ncards, and a 2004 tax lien for $533.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n.  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debt is also documented in his SOR response and his oral statement at his \nhearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n  \n   \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d \nHowever, the problem of about $60,000 in unresolved, delinquent debt continues to \n\u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of the real estate downturn as well as his periods of \nunemployment or underemployment. He does not receive full mitigating credit because \nhe did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling as part of his \nbankruptcy. However, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control\u201d because six debts totaling over $60,000 remain unresolved. He has \nalso established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed \nsome, recent good faith2 in the resolution of his SOR debts by paying his child support.  \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any debts. \nHowever, I will apply AG \u00b6 20(e) to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($533 owed on state tax lien for unpaid \nchild support) and 1.i ($212 judgment owed on a hospital bill). Applicant said the $533 \ndebt is paid. He thought his employer should pay the $212 debt because he was injured \non the job. He credibly disputes these two debts. Moreover, they constitute less than \ntwo percent of his total delinquent debt.3  \n \nI will briefly provide an additional explanation about my reasons for mitigating or \nnot mitigating the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k in the Formal Findings \nsection of this decision at page 13, infra: \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.b is mitigated because he has a payment plan and is making payments \non his child support payments, although he conceded it was under threat of renewed \ngarnishment of his pay, and he owes about $5,000 in overdue child support.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is not mitigated. Applicant owes at least $37,564 on his mortgage of \n$326,000. His mortgage became delinquent in November 2008. Although he used the \nbankruptcy filings and attempted renegotiation or loan modification of his mortgage, he \ndid not take sufficient action to establish financial responsibility. His most recent \npayment was four or five months ago when Applicant sent in $1,500. The last time he \npaid $2,500 was probably in November 2008. He did not provide a payment history from \nhis mortgage company or by using bank account statements. He did not adequately \nconnect his periods of unemployment and underemployment with the failure to pay his \nmortgage.   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k are mitigated. Applicant filed for bankruptcy to stop \nforeclosure on his residence. It is a fairly common and legal practice of businesses and \nindividuals to file bankruptcy to obtain some temporary relief from creditors.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts have been insufficient \nin regard to six delinquent debts, totaling more than $60,000. Applicant promised to pay \nthe remaining SOR debts; however, I am not confident he will keep that promise \nbecause of his lack of meaningful progress on SOR debt resolution demonstrated over \nthe last two years. He did not provide sufficient information to establish that he could not \nhave made partial payments on several of the six debts.    \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to providing false documentation to his employer: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn March 21, 2008, Applicant signed his security clearance application, in which \nhe failed to disclose his bankruptcy filing and several delinquent debts. At his hearing, \nhe admitted that he failed to disclose required financial information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(b) both apply and further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant disclosed a DUI offense and the garnishment of his child support on his \nSF-86. He said his employer simply copied his 2001 security clearance application, \napparently only including updates of his employment and perhaps some other limited \ninformation. His disclosure of other derogatory information on his SF-86 is an indication \nhe was not trying to hide adverse information. I conclude Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification \nof his security clearance application is mitigated. Although he provided false information \non his security clearance application, AG \u00b6 17(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nfinancial information. The falsification allegations are not substantiated. I am satisfied he \ndid not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose his delinquent debts and bankruptcy \nfiling with intent to deceive.4 I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Findings section of this decision \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6 2.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is insufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). He is generally a law-abiding citizen (his only criminal offense is a DUI in \n2000). His current financial problems were partially caused by some factors partially or \nfully beyond his control: (1) insufficient income, (2) the real estate downturn, (3) \nunemployment, and (4) underemployment. He paid or resolved two small SOR debts. \nHe started paying his delinquent child support. He has new payment plans with several \ncreditors. He promised to pay his delinquent debts.   \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high \nschool and has some college. His employment history and contributions to a defense \ncontractor speak well for his character. He understands how to budget and what he \nneeds to do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his \nloyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense \nas a contractor. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial \nresponsibility. However, all of these positive attributes are insufficient to mitigate \nsecurity concerns at this time.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s six delinquent debts have been delinquent for a substantial period of time. \nHe has not paid anything to his mortgage in several months. He purchased a BMW and \nthen did not make any payments for more than a year on his car loan. He did not \nestablish that he could not have made greater progress addressing his delinquent \ndebts. He has admitted a total of six delinquent debts, totaling more than $60,000 in \narrearages, and he has not paid anything to these six creditors in the several months \nprior to his hearing. He showed some effort to increase his income by working two jobs, \nbut he did not make enough effort to reduce his expenses and/or to pay at least partial \npayments on his SOR debts. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted with sufficient \neffort and self-discipline to resolve his delinquent debts and to better document his \nremedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much financial \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nirresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises unmitigated \nsecurity concerns.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated personal \nconduct security concerns; however, he has not sufficiently mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.h to 1.k: \nFor Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 37 years old. He married in 1998 and divorced in August 2001. He has two children from that marriage; their ages are 16 and 12. He has taken several technical courses in college or trade schools (Tr. 20). Applicant has been employed as an electrician for the past 20 years. He seeks a security clearance. Financial Considerations Applicant admitted all 33 delinquent accounts appearing under paragraph 1 (financial considerations) of the SOR, but he does not recognize each account (Tr. 42). His explanation is that the security people told him to admit all the debts and then explain the debts later. (Id.). The total amount of debts as of the date of the SOR was approximately $37,000, with medical debts ($28,000) representing about 2/3 of the total amount. He admitted all allegations listed under paragraph 2 (personal conduct) of the SOR. However, Applicant claims he did not intentionally omit information from his SCA. The security department told him to admit everything (Tr. 71-74). His answers are incorporated into the following factual findings. There appear to be two reasons for Applicant\u2019s financial problems. The first reason is the nature of his profession that is characterized by short employment contracts, layoffs and other types of gaps in employment (Tr. 35). These employment problems have been aggravated by medical problems in Applicant\u2019s case. His SCA shows he has worked for 16 employers since 2001. The short employment contracts have cause",

On May 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.\nAugust 31, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received on May 9, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on July 8, 2009 for a hearing on July 27, 2009. The hearing\nwas held as scheduled. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted\ninto evidence without objection to support the government's case. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted five exhibits (AE A-AE E). The five exhibits were received into evidence. The\nrecord remained open until August 7, 2009 to allow Applicant to submit additional\nevidence. No evidence was received. DOHA received the transcript on August 5, 2009.\nThe record closed on August 7, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 37 years old. He married in 1998 and divorced in August 2001.

The first\nreason is the nature of his profession that is characterized by short employment\ncontracts, layoffs and other types of gaps in employment (Tr. 35). These employment\nproblems have been aggravated by medical problems in Applicant\u2019s case. His SCA\nshows he has worked for 16 employers since 2001. The short employment contracts\nhave caused insurance problems. Occasionally, Applicant has not worked long enough\nto qualify for health insurance. An example of the lack of insurance coverage occurred\nin 2004 (Tr. 38) when he had no insurance to cover his appendectomy costing $23,543\n(subparagraph 1.l.). His surgery was complicated by an infection that required 10 extra\ndays in the hospital, and three or four months of convalescence (Tr. 49-50). Applicant\nhad no insurance in 2008 when his son received treatment for having a needle lodged\nin his foot (Tr. 61). Applicant is currently not working because of a back injury (Tr. 80-\n81). \nThe second reason has two parts. Applicant is trying to officially obtain full\ncustody of his son so that he can end child support payments. Unofficially, Applicant\nhas full custody of the child anyway (Tr. 24). In addition, he has always provided\n\n3\nfinancial help for his mother, sister, brother, and former wife whenever they needed it\n(Tr. 33).  \nThe credit reports reflect that Applicant\u2019s financial accounts started falling\ndelinquent between December 2001 (subparagraph 1.a.) and August 2008\n(subparagraph 1.ee.). As noted in the Statement of the Case, Applicant was provided\nadditional time to furnish documentation supporting his claim of having paid some of the\nmedical services (Tr. 53) or any other debt (Tr. 85). No documentation was supplied. \nIn his interrogatory responses (GE 2) dated January 15, 2009, Applicant provided\nno individual responses to any of the delinquent accounts appearing in the first nine\npages of the exhibit. On the last page, he stated he intended to pay his debts as his\nfinances allowed. Then he stated, \u201cI will continue to contact and make payment\narrangements on my debts as finances allow me to do so.\u201d (Id.) At the hearing,\nApplicant testified he has taken no action on the debts because he is waiting on the\nsecurity clearance decision (Tr. 80).\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security investigation began on August 7, 2008, when Applicant certified and\nsigned his SCA. Under section 27 (FINANCIAL RECORD), Applicant answered\nquestion 27B (wage garnishments/property repossessions?) \u201cno,\u201d when he should have\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d because of his vehicle repossession in 2003 (subparagraph 1.f.). In\nresponse to questions 28A (any debts over 180 days delinquent in the last 7 years), and\n28B (over 90 days delinquent on any debts), Applicant answered \u201cno,\u201d when he should\nhave answered \u201cyes\u201d because of his admissions to the delinquent accounts listed in the\nSOR. In addition to his admissions to the vehicle repossession and other overdue\naccounts listed in the SOR, the delinquent debt information is substantiated in the two\ncredit reports identified as GE 3 (August 15, 2008), and GE 4 (February 26, 2009). \nBefore treading into his explanations for the missing information, Applicant\nprovided a general explanation that he was following the standard procedure of applying\nfor a construction job where \u201cyou just put down basically no and then answer any\nquestions later that come up.\u201d (Tr. 66). Applicant provided four explanations for the\nmissing information; (1) they just handed him papers and told him to sign the\napplication; (2) he did not understand the importance of the application; (3) he did not\nreally believe that the debts needed to be reported; and, (4) I am not certain about his\nfourth explanation, but I believe he got confused by the questions and simply wanted to\nfinish the application so he could turn it in (Tr. 68-73). I find Applicant intentionally\nomitted material information about his finances from his SCA in October 2008.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant furnished four character statements from coworkers and his mother.\nReference A believes Applicant takes pride in his work while dedicating quality time to\nhis family. According to Reference A, Applicant paid his former wife\u2019s telephone bill so\n\n4\nthat his children could talk to her. Reference B has found Applicant trustworthy, honest\nand a faithful employee. Reference C, a coworker, considers Applicant a leader and a\nteam player. Reference D, a coworker and friend for 20 years, commended Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, according to his mother (Reference E), were\ncaused by sporadic employment and inconsistent insurance coverage. His mother\nbelieves Applicant is a diligent worker who takes pride in his work. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on commonsense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\n\n5\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies began in December 2001. Over the next\nseven years, Applicant collected 33 debts totaling approximately $37,000. Both FC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC\nDC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nThe first four mitigating conditions of the FC guideline are potentially applicable:\nFC mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC\nMC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC\n\u00b6 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC\n\u00b6 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts). None of the mitigators are applicable.\nFC MC \u00b6 20.a. does not apply as there are 33 delinquent debts, with three\nbecoming delinquent in August 2008. The fact that Applicant has provided no plan to\naddress his current debts, other than repeatedly stating he plans to pay them, continues\nto raise doubts about his current reliability and judgment. \nApplicant divorced his wife in 2001. He had sporadic employment since 2001. He\nand members of his family had some medical problems since 2001. The divorce, the\nirregular employment, and the isolated medical problems were events beyond his\ncontrol. However, he has made no documented adjustments in his financial practices or\nlifestyle to confront the realities of his employment. In addition, he was hired at his\npresent job in August 2008, and could have taken some small steps to show he truly\nwants to pay his creditors by paying off one or more of the eight creditors that hold\noverdue accounts of less than $100. \n\n6\nThere is no indication Applicant has ever had financial counseling. Because his\n33 debts are still unresolved, FC MC \u00b6 20.c. and FC MC \u00b6 20.c. do not apply. Given his\nseven-year history of not meeting his financial obligations, Applicant has not mitigated\nthe FC guideline. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b6 15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nPC DC \u00b6 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire to determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness) applies based on Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission in his SCA of his\nrepossessed car (question 27B) and 33 delinquent debts (questions 28A and 28B). \nPC MC \u00b6 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment or falsification, before being confronted with the facts) does not\napply as Applicant continues to deny he intentionally falsified his SCA. PC MC \u00b6 17.c.\n(the offense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his intentional\nomission of material information raises current doubts about his judgment and reliability\nthat are not sufficiently relieved by his favorable character evidence. \nThe application of PC MC \u00b6 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable or\nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) is predicated upon\nan understanding by the applicant that his omissions were intentional. Applicant, who is\nnow 37 years old, has not reached that understanding, as evidenced by his other\nexplanations for omitting information from his SCA. The PC guideline is resolved against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC and PC guidelines. I have also\nweighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors:\n\n7\n\u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe record reflects Applicant is employed in a profession with short employment\ncontracts where time on the job is, more often than not, too short to qualify for insurance\ncoverage. Applicant has worked in this profession for 20 years. Between 2001 and\nAugust 2008 (his first permanent employment), Applicant has been employed by 16\ndifferent contractors. He had his appendix removed in 2004 when he was uninsured.\nApplicant did not have insurance when his son had a needle removed from his foot.\nApplicant currently has a back injury that has kept him unemployed for an undetermined\nperiod. However, Applicant has done nothing to address his listed debts at any time\ncovered by the SOR. There are eight debts under $100 that he could have paid but he\nhas not. In addition, Applicant deliberately omitted the debts from his SCA, attempting to\ngive the impression he had no debts. Considering the entire record, including his\nfavorable character evidence, it is not clearly consistent to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.gg.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",
