Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn January 25, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nFor the reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling about $35,150. \nApplicant admitted four SOR allegations with the largest debts and denied the remaining three \nallegations with debts that totaled about $680. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on an alleged \ncredit card debt of about $8,700 because he made payments that significantly reduced its balance. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the remaining allegations, noting that he had taken no action \nconcerning two of the larger debts and did not begin taking action on the other debts until he was \nconfronted about them in a background interview. The Judge concluded that Applicant did not \npresent sufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he is receiving disability \npay. This finding reads, \u201cApplicant currently earns between $85,000 and $87,000 per year, \ndepending on overtime, plus disability pay of about $1,000 per month. (Tr. 27, 29)\u201d Decision at 4. \nApplicant\u2019s challenge has some merit. In his testimony, Applicant stated he was going to start \nreceiving disability pay of about $1,000 from the Department of Veteran Affairs but did not state he \nwas receiving such payments at that time. Id. On the other hand, the Judge\u2019s discussion of the \ndisability pay on Page 3 of the Decision, which notes Applicant was waiting to receive such pay, is \nmuch more consistent with his testimony.  While the Judge may have erred regarding Applicant\u2019s \nreceipt of disability pay, it does not constitute a harmful error because it did not likely affect the \noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s other arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. For example, he highlights that his child support payments of about $14,400 per year \ngreatly impact his ability to satisfy the alleged debts, that he has had access to sensitive information \nin the past without any issues, that he is not subject to coercion or exploitation, that his has been \nmeeting his current financial obligations for years, and that he was not living beyond his means when \nhe incurred the alleged debts. An ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the evidence is \nnot sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

He has a \nticket to travel to the United States for two weeks in 2022 to attend a wedding and visit family and \nfriends. He is also an active alumnus of a U.S. university and recently received recognition for his \nparticipation in a mentorship program.  \n\u201cThe United States attaches great importance to the success of Ukraine as a free and \ndemocratic state with a flourishing market economy. The U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic \nPartnership highlights the importance of the bilateral relationship and continued commitment to \nthe United States to support enhanced engagement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO) and Ukraine.\u201d Decision at 5. The United States is assisting Ukraine to fully integrate \ninto the Euro-Atlantic community. Both countries belong to a number of the same international \norganizations. \u201cThere is no indication in the administrative notice documents indicating that \nUkraine targets the United States for military or economic espionage.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \nSince its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has been undergoing \nprofound political and economic changes as it moves towards a market economy and multiparty \ndemocracy. While its first presidential election was married by governmental intimidation and \nelectoral fraud, its most recent presidential and parliamentary elections were considered free and \nfair by international observers. Ukraine has significant human rights and police corruption \nproblems.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe geopolitical situation in Ukraine is much different now than \u201cin 2014 and 2015, when \nthe level of unrest and Russian aggressiveness raised questions about the ability of the Ukrainian \ngovernment to survive.\u201d Decision at 11.

The evidence establishes Mitigating \nCondition 8(b), i.e., \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest[.]\u201d Applicant has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. \nHis goal is for his wife and stepson to become U.S. citizens. He has terminated all contacts with \nRussian citizens and limited his contacts with Ukrainian citizens with the exception of his family \nmembers and two friends he met while working in the Peace Corps. Mitigating Condition 8(d), \ni.e., \u201cthe foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are approved by the \nagency head or designee[,]\u201d applies to his Peace Corps involvement in Ukraine but not to his \ncontinuing contacts. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \nIn the latest appeal, Department Counsel states that, \u201calthough the Government is not \nappealing the Judge\u2019s determination that he would not hold Applicant to a very heavy burden, the \nonerous facts in this case \u2013 an applicant who has embraced life in a country occupied by Russia \u2013 \ncreates a clear, present, and ongoing security risk that is not mitigated under any standard.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 10. Department Counsel appears to be advocating for a per se bar to a security clearance \nunder Guideline B. Neither the Judge nor the Appeal Board has the authority to create such a bar \nunder the adjudicative guidelines.1 See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 05-00951 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006) \nfor the proposition that Administrative Judges are bound by agency policy. \n1 In our prior decision in this case, we noted that Department Counsel on appeal was proposing for the first time to \napply a standard. As we commented then, \u201c. . . this cannot become a practice in DOHA cases.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n19-03991 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2021). \n4 \n\n \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn Guideline B cases, the current geopolitical conditions in a country are relevant \nconsiderations that must be brought to bear in making a security clearance determination. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 11-04980 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep 21. 2012). Furthermore, recent experience has \nshown that a friendly country in bad circumstances can very quickly become a new place. \nDevelopments over the summer in Afghanistan highlight this point. A country with a government \nthat was allied with us fell very quickly, even unexpectedly, leaving an unknown number of \npersons with ties to the United States in a precarious situation. The Judge\u2019s decision alludes to \nthese developments but draws no conclusions from them. \nApplicant\u2019s choice is to reside in Ukraine (in and of itself, a perfectly valid choice) where \nhe has multiple contacts. Although Ukraine is a friendly country, its current geopolitical \ncircumstances are problematic from a security perspective. Russia, a hostile power, is next door. \nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2014. It occupies Crimea and other portions of Ukraine. Tensions \nremain high between these countries. Having invaded once, the possibility exists that Russia may \nintervene militarily in Ukraine again. Applicant\u2019s relatives in Ukraine could become a means \nthough which Russia or its surrogates exert pressure on him to compromise U.S. protected \ninformation. Such geopolitical circumstances warrant a heightened level of scrutiny in analyzing \nthe mitigation evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05092 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22 2017).  From \nour review of the record, the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that, given the potential for \na significant conflict of interest in this case, Applicant\u2019s obligation to the U.S. would necessarily \noutweigh his ties to wife, stepchild, and mother-in-law in Ukraine. As noted above, any doubt \nmust be resolved in favor of the national security. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and character are not an issue in this case. His circumstances create \nsecurity concerns. Common sense and a knowledge of the ways of the world suggest that even \nthose whose character is unimpeachable could be faced with circumstances that would seriously \ntempt them to place the safety of loved ones ahead of other competing interests. In this case, the \nrecord evidence, when viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under the Egan standard. \n5 \n\n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

Bias is generally a claim raised against the Judge who is required to render \nan independent, fair, and impartial decision (Directive \u00b6 5.2.13) as opposed to a Department \nCounsel who represents the Government\u2019s interests in the case (Directive \u00b6 5.2.7) and, as an \nadvocate for a party opponent, is not required to be neutral or impartial.  Furthermore, there is a \nrebuttable presumption that a Department Counsel, as a Federal employee, carries out his or her \nduties in good faith. Adverse Decision Affirmed. \nCASE NO: 20-00113.a1 \nDATE: 07/13/2021 \nDATE: July 13, 2021 \n) \nIn Re: \n) \n) \n\uffad\n\u00ad\n) \nISCR Case No. 20-00113 \n) \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \n) \nAPPEAL BOARD DECISION \nAPPEARANCES \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nJames B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \n\nLeon J. Schachter, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On May \n15, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 30, 2020, Department Counsel sent Applicant\u2019s Counsel an Amendment to the SOR \nthat changed a sentence in one of the three initial allegations and added three other Guideline F \nallegations and a single allegation under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). On October 13, 2020, \nApplicant responded to the SOR amendment and submitted an Addendum to Amended SOR that \nprovided explanations regarding the new allegations. On April 21, 2021, after the hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey issued a decision \ndenying Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the three initial Guideline F allegations. \nDepartment Counsel did not challenge those favorable findings on appeal. In his appeal brief, \nApplicant raises the following issues: whether the Judge erred in his rulings on challenges to the \nSOR amendment; whether the Judge failed to consider key evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s \nadverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we \naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his 40s, works for a defense contractor. He has earned three master\u2019s \ndegrees, including in business and finance. His employer considers him a highly valued employee \nwho is trustworthy and reliable.  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR amendment alleged that Applicant was indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes in the approximate amounts of (1) $1,622 for tax year 2010 that \nremained unpaid until 2016, (2) $5,400 for tax year 2013 that remained unpaid until 2017, and (3) \n$5,245 for tax year 2014 that remained unpaid until 2018.  In responding to the SOR amendment, \nApplicant admitted those three allegations with explanations. The Judge concluded that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from those allegations, noting that Applicant had \nsubstantial income and failed to establish that he was unable to pay the delinquent taxes sooner. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR amendment alleged that Applicant falsified his security \nclearance application (SCA) in April 2019.  In that document, he responded \u201cYes\u201d to the question \nthat asked whether he failed to pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law and disclosed \nhe underpaid his state taxes for 2016 that resulted in a wage garnishment. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to a \nfollow-up question that asked, \u201cAre there any other instances in the last seven (7) years where you \nfailed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance[.]\u201d  Decision \nat 11, quoting from Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 37. In doing so, he failed to disclose that his \n2 \n\nFederal taxes for 2010, 2013, and 2014 were delinquent and remained unpaid until 2016, 2017, and \n2018, respectively. \nApplicant denied he intended to deceive the Government about owing delinquent taxes in \nhis SCA . He claimed that he did not believe his taxes were delinquent because he had an ongoing \npayment plan since around 2013 and was making payments in accordance with the plan. Applicant \nmade some payments under the payment plans but a major portion of the alleged tax debts were paid \nthrough the withholding of his refunds for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Although not alleged, \nApplicant also owed delinquent Federal taxes in the approximate amounts of $2,700 for 2018 that \nwas not paid until early 2020 and $5,260 for 2019 that he intends to pay. Applicant did not provide \nconvincing evidence that he honestly answered the SCA question at issue. He is an intelligent \nperson with exceptional experience in financial matters.  The SCA question was clear and easy to \nunderstand. He elected not to disclose his history of having delinquent Federal tax debts. The record \nevidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a), i.e., \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities[.]\u201d \nDiscussion \nChallenges to the SOR Amendment \nThe SOR amendment was not signed by a Government official, dated, or printed on \nGovernment letterhead, although Department Counsel\u2019s cover letter forwarding the SOR amendment \nwas signed, dated, and on letterhead. At the hearing, Applicant raised three objections to the SOR \namendment. The objections claim (1) the amendment was \u201cfundamentally lacking reliability\u201d \nbecause it was not signed, (2) the amendment was not issued in a timely manner, and (3), the \nfalsification allegation was defective because it did not assert Applicant had an intent to deceive. \nTr. at 11-14.  In the decision, the Judge concluded these objections merited no relief. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant renewed his objections to the SOR amendment and stated, \u201cthat \nfundamental fairness required the identity of the charging official be disclosed to the applicant . . . \n[and] an identity is needed so he can determine whether there is some hidden bias at play.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 1-2.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s rulings on the objections.  \nApplicant cites no Appeal Board decisions or other authority supporting his objection to the \nSOR amendment\u2019s authenticity. The Judge ruled that Department Counsel\u2019s letter forwarding the \nSOR amendment to Applicant\u2019s Counsel was sufficient to authenticate the amendment.1 Hearing \nExhibit 5. Applicant has failed to establish that ruling was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee Directive E3.1.32.3.  As to Applicant\u2019s \u201chidden bias\u201d claim, the Appeal Board has previously \n1 The Department Counsel that signed the forwarding letter is different from the one who represented the \nGovernment at the hearing.  \n3 \n\nindicated that bias involves partiality for or against a party or a predisposition to decide a case or \nissue without regard to the merits. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006). \nBias is generally a claim raised against the Judge who is required to render an independent, fair, and \nimpartial decision (Directive \u00b6 5.2.13) as opposed to a Department Counsel who represents the \nGovernment\u2019s interests in the case (Directive \u00b6 5.2.7) and, as an advocate for a party opponent, is \nnot required to be neutral or impartial. Furthermore, there is a rebuttable presumption that a \nDepartment Counsel, as a Federal employee, carries out his or her duties in good faith. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-26704 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008). A party seeking to rebut that presumption \nhas a heavy burden of persuasion.  Applicant\u2019s bias claim fails to meet that burden.  It amounts to \nmere speculation and is not sufficient to raise any fairness or due process concerns.      \nRegarding the objection to the timing of the SOR amendment, Applicant asserted that, if the \nhearing occurred when he originally \u201cthought\u201d it was going to be held, the amendment \u201cwould have \nbeen essentially at the last minute.\u201d  Tr. at 11-12.  The record does not reflect that the hearing was \noriginally proposed to held at an earlier date. The SOR amendment was sent to Applicant\u2019s Counsel \nmore than two months before the date on which the hearing was held. Applicant had adequate time \nto prepare for the hearing. He cites no authority to support his contention that the Government \nshould have issued the SOR amendment at an earlier date.  \nRegarding the objection to the falsification allegation, an SOR is an administrative pleading \nthat is not held to the strict requirements of a criminal indictment, and it does not have to allege \nevery possible fact that might be relevant at the hearing. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08255 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2017). In this case, the falsification allegation asserted that Applicant \u201cfalsified \nmaterial facts\u201d on his SCA, and that he \u201cdeliberately\u201d failed to disclose delinquent Federal taxes. \nThe Judge noted the definition of the word \u201cfalsified\u201d means \u201cfalsely created or altered in order to \ndeceive.\u201d Decision at 4, quoting from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/falsified. It also \nmerits noting that Applicant responded to the falsification allegation by stating, \u201cI adamantly deny \nthat I had any intent to falsify the form.\u201d  Addendum to Amended SOR at 1. This response shows \nthat Applicant was not misled by the allegation. It sufficiently placed him on notice that his intent \nat the time of completing the SCA was a important issue in case. Applicant has failed to establish \nthe falsification allegation was defective.    \nDebt Allegations \nApplicant asserts the Judge failed to consider that he \u201crelied on legal advice to stop making \npayments on student loans because they were predatory[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 5.  This assignment of \nerror lacks merit. The Judge discussed that evidence, noted Applicant made a final settlement \npayment on the student loans, and found in favor of him on those allegations. On the other hand, \nApplicant\u2019s brief does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s adverse findings of fact and conclusions \nregarding the Federal tax debts, other than his challenge to the amendments to the SOR which were \nabout the tax debts.   \nFalsification Allegation \n4 \n\nIn challenging the Judge\u2019s adverse finding on the falsification allegation, Applicant asserts \nthe \u201coriginal due dates\u201d of the tax debts \u201cwere overwritten\u201d by the IRS installment agreements. \nAppeal Brief at 4. His challenges to the adverse falsification findings are not persuasive for various \nreasons. First, he is making the assertion that the \u201coriginal due dates were overwritten\u201d for the first \ntime on appeal. At the hearing, he testified that he thought he did not fail to pay the taxes because \nhe had a payment plan. Tr. 53-55. During his testimony, he did not assert that the IRS had changed \nthe due dates. He did not offer into evidence the IRS installment agreements in question and does \nnot identify any record evidence that corroborates his assertion that the original due dates were \noverwritten. The IRS repayment plans for tax year 2019 that were admitted into evidence (AE I and \nT) do not corroborate that assertion. Also, it merits noting Applicant\u2019s Federal taxes became \ndelinquent when they were not paid as required by law.  A reasonable person, not to mention one \nwith advanced business degrees, would understand that past-due taxes remain delinquent until they \nare paid or otherwise resolved. Furthermore, the Judge discussed evidence in his analysis that \nreflected adversely on Applicant\u2019s credibility. Decision at 20-21. As stated in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, \n\u201cthe Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative \nJudge.\u201d In short, Applicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any error in his analysis of \nthe evidence regarding the falsification allegation. \nApplicant also contends the Judge \u201cproclaimed near the end of the hearing that he would find \nthat Applicant had overcome the falsification allegation\u201d and that he committed reversible error by \nhis \u201cflip flop\u201d on that allegation in the decision. Appeal Brief at 4-6. In support of this contention, \nApplicant quotes the following comments of the Judge: \n. . . You gave a pretty good reason. It has to be a true reason. Okay? If it\u2019s the true \nreason, I\u2019m pretty much satisfied that you were answering in good faith.  But if it\u2019s \nnot a true reason, then that really undercuts against good faith, and honesty, and \ncandidness, and all those things we look for in security clearances. \nSo need more information on the IRS, need more information on those \n[student] loans. And if we can get that information, we\u2019re going to have a pretty \nclear answer on what\u2019s appropriate to do in this case.  [Tr. at 80.]  \nWhen read in context, the quoted comment does not support Applicant\u2019s contention. At the hearing, \nthe Judge did not commit to find in Applicant\u2019s favor on the falsification allegation. Rather, the \nJudge made clear that his decision was to be based on Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions \nregarding the IRS installment agreements. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s assessment of the post-\nhearing evidence.   \nApplicant further contends that the Judge erred in failing to consider the substantial evidence \nregarding his reputation for honesty in analyzing whether he incorrectly answered the SCA question. \nThe Judge, however, made findings of fact regarding Applicant\u2019s character evidence and discussed \nthat evidence in his whole-person assessment.  Applicant\u2019s arguments are neither enough to rebut \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the \n5 \n\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-01649 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Napolitana, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 27, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handing Protected Information), \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On September 28, 2021, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nGina L. Marine denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government met its burden \nof proof, whether the Judge erred in her findings of fact and credibility determination, whether the \nJudge was biased against Applicant, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his thirties, has taken college courses, but has not yet earned a degree. He \nserved honorably in the military for about six years. Since 2018, he has been employed in \ninformation technology positions for two defense contractors. He has previously held a security \nclearance. Reference letters reflect that Applicant\u2019s work performance and character are highly \nregarded.  \nUnder Guideline K, the SOR alleged that Applicant downloaded files on two occasions in \nviolation of his company\u2019s policies in June 2019. Both of these allegations were cross-alleged \nunder Guidelines M and E. Under all three guidelines, Applicant admitted the allegations \nconcerning one incident and denied the allegations concerning the other incident. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on the admitted allegations and in favor of him on the denied allegations. The \nallegations he admitted involved him downloading over 2000 files from his unclassified work \ncomputer to a personal USB drive. \nThe downloaded files included company proprietary \ninformation, third-party proprietary information, and export-controlled information. \nThis \ndownloading occurred two days before Applicant informed the company of his resignation and \nintent to begin employment with another company. An investigation revealed no evidence that \nApplicant transferred the files from his USB drive to any other computer or that the USB drive left \nhis residence. The company concluded \u201cApplicant\u2019s downloading and transfer of files to his \npersonal USB drive was a deliberate attempt to obtain proprietary data for outside use\u201d in direct \nviolation of the company\u2019s policies. Decision at 3. In 2017, Applicant had signed a document \nacknowledging that he was prohibited from using the company\u2019s or a third-party\u2019s proprietary \ninformation for his or another\u2019s benefit.   \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR also alleged Applicant provided false information in two \ninterviews regarding the downloading activity.

When confronted \nwith information that the files were transferred two days before submitting his resignation in June \nof that year, he denied transferring them at that time. He did admit that he may have transferred \nhis employment offer from the other company to the USB drive at that time. Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent explanations during the two interviews were not credible. Substantial evidence exists \nto conclude \u201can intent on the part of Applicant not only to provide false and misleading statements \nbut also to omit and conceal materially relevant information during the interviews[.]\u201d Decision \nat 13. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had 11 delinquent debts totaling about \n$48,000. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the delinquent debts. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on six past-due student loans totaling over $31,000 and for him on the \nother debts. In responding to interrogatories in May 2020, Applicant claimed he was current in \nmaking payments under a rehabilitation program for the student loans but did not provide any \ncorroborating documentation. Applicant\u2019s credit report from January 2021 does not reflect that \nthe student loans have been rehabilitated or otherwise resolved.  He failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his delinquent student loans. \nDiscussion \nDownloading of Files \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of her unfavorable findings regarding the \ndownloading of the files was flawed. In making this argument, Applicant highlights that the \ncompany\u2019s investigation revealed that there was no evidence he ever transferred files from his \nUSB drive to another computer and no evidence of his intent to do anything nefarious with the \nfiles. He also argues the Judge\u2019s logic is difficult to follow, noting on the one hand she found he \nviolated company policies and, on the other, he never did anything with the files. Additionally, he \nchallenges the Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings regarding downloading allegations by comparing \nthem to her favorable findings regarding those allegations. These arguments are not persuasive.  \nFirst, Applicant admitted the downloading SOR allegations that the Judge found against him. The \nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between admitted or proven \ncircumstances under any of its guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. See. e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018). Any attempt to argue or infer that Applicant\u2019s \nunauthorized downloading of protected information onto a personal USB drive did not create \nsecurity concerns lacks merit. Second, the absence of evidence showing that Applicant transferred \nthe files to another computer is not a key issue in analyzing these allegations. The pertinent \ndisqualifying conditions under Guidelines K, M, and E do not require an actual compromise of \nprotected information or a subsequent downloading of that information from the USB drive to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nanother computer.1 Applicant\u2019s admitted misconduct by downloading protected information onto \nhis personal USB drive in violation of company policies was sufficient to raise security concerns. \nThird, Applicant\u2019s comparison of the Judge\u2019s unfavorable and favorable findings involving the \ntwo incidents shows no inconsistency because the incidents are distinguishable.     \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s arguments, it also merits noting the Appeal Board gives deference \nto a company\u2019s findings and conclusions in its security investigations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-08385 at 4 (\u201c[B]ecause of the unique position of employers as actual administrators of \nclassified or protected information programs and the degree of knowledge possessed by them in \nany particular case, their determinations and characterizations regarding security violations are \nentitled to considerable deference, and should not be discounted or contradicted without a cogent \nexplanation.\u201d). The Judge committed no error in relying on the company\u2019s investigation that \nconcluded Applicant\u2019s downloading of files to his personal USB drive was in direct violation of \nits policies.  File of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 7 at 5.  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in finding he was escorted off the company\u2019s \npremises. This contention lacks merit. The company\u2019s investigation reflects that a senior manager \ndirected other employees to expedite Applicant\u2019s separation from the company and to \u201cwalk him \noff the property.\u201d FORM Item 7 at 2-3. The investigation further reflects an employee informed \nApplicant that he would not be allowed to return to his office. When Applicant requested personal \nitems be returned to him, the employee informed him arrangements would be made separately.  \nApplicant surrendered his badge and was \u201cwalked off\u201d the property. Id. at 3. Substantial evidence \nexists to support this challenged finding. \nStatements to Investigators \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in finding against him on the two falsification \nallegations. In doing so, he challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he was not credible. He argues \nit is \u201cabundantly clear that the Judge had a negative perception of the Applicant due to the \n[company\u2019s] internal investigation.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. This argument demonstrates no error. As \nthe trier of fact, the Judge is responsible for weighing the evidence, including the company\u2019s \ninvestigation, and has the inherent authority to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility. Moreover, \ninconsistent and implausible statements can form the basis for a negative credibility determination. \nThe Appeal Board is required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant failed to put forth any reason why we should disturb the Judge\u2019s \nunfavorable credibility determination.  \nApplicant also asserts that he did not know he was downloading files containing proprietary \ninformation. He claims the files did not contain any protective information markings. The \ncompany\u2019s investigation contradicts that claim. The investigation reflects the files contained \nproprietary information markings. FORM Item 7 at 2. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s \nmaterial findings and conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s false statements to the investigators are \nbased on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3(App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \n1 See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), 34(b), 34(c), 34(g), 40(d), 40(e), and 40(f). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent Loans \nIn arguing that the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding the student loans was flawed, Applicant\u2019s \nbrief relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F cases. His reliance on those \nhearing-level decisions is misplaced. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, how particular \nfact scenarios in other cases were decided at the hearing level are generally not a relevant \nconsideration in our review of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, \n2021), setting forth a lengthier discussion of this issue. In short, Applicant\u2019s arguments based on \nfavorable hearing-level decisions in cases involving different applicants and different facts do not \nestablish that the Judge\u2019s conclusions and analysis regarding the student loans are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. \nWeighing of the Evidence \nApplicant contends the Judge improperly assessed and weighed the evidence. He argues, \nfor example, that the Judge did not consider his denial of the false statements and that the Judge \nignored mitigating and whole-person evidence. His arguments, however, are neither sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to \nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nBias \nApplicant contends that he \u201cwas not afforded a fair evaluation.\u201d Appeal Brief at 16. To \nthe extent that he is arguing the Judge was biased against him, this argument is not persuasive. \nBias is not demonstrated merely because a Judge found against the appealing party. There is a \nrebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome \nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jan. 30, 2020). Applicant has not directed our attention to anything in the record that would \nlikely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite impartiality.  \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Bigley, Esq. \nJeffery D. Billett, Esq. \nTheDepartmentofDefense (DoD)declined to grant Applicant a securityclearance. On April \n24, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On \nFebruary 9, 2021, the Government amended the SOR by rewriting the sole Guideline J allegation. \nOn May 5, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Wilford H. Ross granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his \nanalysis of the evidence. Applicant submitted a cross appeal contending the Judge erred in making \ncertain findings of fact. Applicant and Department Counsel submitted a reply briefs in response to \nthe others appeal.  For the reasons stated below, we reverse. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant, who is in his 50s, works for a defense contractor and is seeking to retain his \nsecurity clearance.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and is divorced. As amended, the SOR allegation \nasserts that, in 2019, Applicant was arrested for domestic violence charges against his then-\ngirlfriend, and he pled guilty to possession of an illegal assault weapon for which he was placed on \nprobation for five years, fined, and barred from possessing any firearms for five years.  \nAs of early 2019, Applicant had been dating his ex-girlfriend for about two years, and she \nhad been living at his house for several months. She held a county law enforcement position. \nDuring an evening in which both had been drinking, they had an argument about whether she would \nreimburse him for several thousand dollars he lent her for veterinary care of her deceased dog. The \nargument escalated. She pushed him on the chest. At some point, he threatened to use a taser on \nher if she did not leave the house. While he was removing her items from a dog run in the yard, she \nattempted to stop him by pinning him in the dog run.  \nApplicant then put his hands on [the ex-girlfriend] repeatedly in an attempt to push \nher out of his way so that he could leave the dog run. He admitted that he pushed her \non the chest, choked her, pushed her jaw back and eventually gouged her in the eye \nwith his thumb, though he claims the last was accidental. He stated that he was \n2 \n\nafraid of [the ex-girlfriend] because of her training . . . . He also stated that he used \nthe minimum amount of force to get her to back away.  [Decision at 3.]   \nApplicant thereafter went into the house, while his ex-girlfriend remained outside. Both called the \nsheriff\u2019s department. \u201cAllegedly [the ex-girlfriend] told the deputies that Applicant said he would \nuse one of his firearms to kill her and any responding officers.\u201d Id. Applicant denied making the \nthreat. Nine deputies, plus a police dog, responded. Applicant stayed in the house for over a half-\nhour before responding to the deputies requests to come out. Applicant claims he used that time in \nan attempt to find a lawyer to assist him.  \nApplicant was taken into custody and initially charged with various domestic violence \noffenses. The district attorney\u2019s office decided not to prosecute those charges due to the lack of \nphysical evidence supporting the ex-girlfriend\u2019s story. Applicant Counsel argued the ex-girlfriend \nhad falsely concocted similar domestic violence case against a former boyfriend, which led to her \nbeing placed on a list of law enforcement personnel whose credibility has been officially questioned. \nAs part of his plea agreement to the assault weapons charge (discussed below), Applicant was \nordered to stay away from the ex-girlfriend for five years.  \nWhile Applicant was in custody following his arrest, sheriff\u2019s deputies executed a search \nwarrant for weapons and other evidence in his house. When they arrived, Applicant\u2019s sister and one \nof his friends were removing weapons for storage in his mother\u2019s house. The deputies took the \nweapons and determine several were illegal under state law.  Under state law, statutorily designed \n\u201cassault weapons\u201d were required to be removed from the state, disassembled, registered online with \nthe state, or modified to no longer constitute assault weapons. Applicant stated that he attempted \nto register them but was unsuccessful before the deadline, which appears to have been a common \nproblem that owners experienced.  He purchased the kit to modify them so that he did not need to \nregister them but \u201csimply forgot\u201d to take that action because he \u201cgot caught up in other activities of \nlife.\u201d Decision at 5. In early 2019, Applicant pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of an \nassault weapon and was sentenced as reflected in the SOR allegation. \nApplicant\u2019s current girlfriend testified the incident in question is completelyout his character. \nHe also submitted letters of recommendation from coworkers and friends describing him as friendly, \nhelpful, and hardworking. None of them had ever seen him act in the way he did on the night in \nquestion.    \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \n\u201cApplicant admitted that the argument [with the ex-girlfriend] turned physical on both their \nparts, though he denied being the aggressor.\u201d Id. at 8. Her conduct in falsifying information of a \nprior domestic violence incident compromises her credibility. \u201cApplicant\u2019s conduct on the night in \nquestion is an aberration in his normal conduct. The testimony of his current girlfriend, who \nadmitted that she had been in an abusive marriage before dating Applicant, is particularly important \nin showing the singularity of the incident.\u201d  Id. \n3 \n\nApplicant was obviously negligent in not modifying the weapons after he was unable to \naccess the state website. \nAlthough still on probation, \u201cApplicant has an outstanding and \nunblemished personal and professional record, as shown by the testimony of his witness and the \nvoluminous documentary evidence in the record.\u201d Id. \u201cApplicant has mitigated the concerns \nregarding his isolated and out-of-character domestic violence incident in 2019, and his failure to \nmodify several firearms in accordance with state law at the same time.\u201d  Id. at 9. \nDiscussion \nBackground \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl.  2 App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails \nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nIn the appeal brief, Department Counsel argue that the Judge erred in his analysis of the \nevidence. Theycontend the Judge failed to consider important aspects of the case and his mitigation \nanalysis is unsupported by a reasoned reading of the record evidence as a whole. We find these \narguments persuasive.  \nThe SOR allegation \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 30. At the hearing, Applicant, through Counsel, admitted the amended \nSOR allegation. Tr. at 8-9.  Having admitted the SOR allegation, the burden was on Applicant to \nmitigate the resulting security concerns and, as always, he had the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The Judge was required to consider all \nrelevant and material information in issuing the clearance decision.  Directive \u00b6 6.3. \nIn the cross-appeal brief, Applicant contends that Judge erred in making some key findings \nof facts. We examine challenged findings to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, that \nis, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion \nin light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant argues, \n4 \n\nfor example, the Judge erred in finding, \u201cHe admitted that he . . . choked [the ex-girlfriend] . . .\u201d \nCross-Appeal Brief at 2, quoting from Decision at 3 (full quote set forth above). He asserts this \nfinding \u201cis completely and outrageously unsupported by ANY record evidence.\u201d Id. The sheriff\u2019s \nreport reflects that the ex-girlfriend told an investigator that Applicant grabbed her throat by one of \nhis hands, while holding a taser in the other, and squeezed her throat causing her to be unable to \nbreathe.  SOR Response, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A at 26.1 During his interview, Applicant was \nasked, \u201cDid you put your hands around her neck? [Applicant] responded, \u2018.. uh .. equally she did \nit to me ..\u2019 I [the deputy] asked [Applicant] who put hands on the neck first? [Applicant] responded, \n\u2018.. I\u2019m gonna say .. she uhhmm .. I\u2019m trying to remember a sequence of events .. because I know this \nis going to be held against me.\u2019\u201d Id. at 25. While Applicant is technically correct the evidence does \nnot support that he \u201cadmitted . . . he choked her[,]\u201d he admitted to putting his hand or hands on her \nneck. None of his challenges in the cross appeal establish harmful error, i.e., one that, had it not \noccurred, the case might have been decided differently. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 at 8 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017). \nA review of the record reveals that the Judge did not address important aspects of the case \nin his analysis of the evidence.  These includes: \na. 911 Call. The sheriff\u2019s report states that, at about 10:00 p.m., Applicant \u201ccalled the \nsheriff\u2019s department and stated he and [the ex-girlfiend] were in a verbal argument and he has no \nweapons in the residence\u201d but confirmed he had a taser in his pocket. AE A at 22. Applicant \ntestified that he never said there were no weapons in the house.  Tr. at 66-68. \nb. Circumstances of the Arrest. While on the 911 call, Applicant learned the sheriff\u2019s \ndepartment was already responding to his residence because the ex-girlfriend had called. \nHe \nterminated the call and attempted to call an attorney. Id. at 68. On direct examination, he testified \nhis attempts to contact an attorney were unsuccessful and the implication in the sheriff\u2019s report that \nhe refused to come out of his house is untrue. Id. at 42-43.  On cross-examination, he was asked, \n\u201cBut when you were actually asked to leave [the house], you did as directed. Is that correct?\u201d He \nresponded, \u201cYes immediately.\u201d Id. at 70. The sheriff\u2019s report contradicts that testimony.2 It reflects: \nAt about 2220 hours, I [the deputy] contacted [Applicant] via his cellphone. After \nseveral attempts with [Applicant] not answering his cellphone, he eventually \nanswered the phone calls. The first time I spoke to [Applicant] he told me he was not \ncomfortable to exiting the house without speaking to legal counsel. I thoroughly \nexplained to [Applicant] the process and necessity for him to exit the home and speak \nto me in person. [Applicant] refused to exit his home and insisted to (sic) he needed \n1 Subsequent citations to AE A are to this exhibit rather than to the exhibit similarly designated offered at the \nhearing.  \n2 In the decision, the Judge noted Applicant presented evidence establishing the primary responding deputy \nhad been the subject of discipline for lying on the job in an unrelated matter. Applicant argued that the ex-girlfriend \nand the deputy had conspired to \u201cframe\u201d him. Decision at 4. The Judge concluded, however, there was no evidence of \nsuch a conspiracy.  \n5 \n\nto ask legal counsel.  I provided him the opportunity and told him I would call him \nback.   \n* * * \nI called [Applicant] a second time, he told me again in a long telephone conversation \nthat he did not feel comfortable exiting the home without speaking to legal counsel. \nI explained to [Applicant] the reason for his safety and deputies safety to exit the \nhouse with nothing in his hands.  [Applicant ] refused and told me he was going to \ntry again to contact his attorney. [Applicant] was concerned that due to his position \nthe outcome of the incident would be difficult. \nAt about 2246 hours, I contacted [Applicant] a third time to have him exit the \nresidence.  There was a total of about 46 minutes before [Applicant] to (sic) exited \nthe house. A total of nine deputies and a sergeant were at the scene during this event. \n[Applicant\u2019s] actions caused a lack of services to the community of [location] as \ndeputies were tied up on this event. Deputies from [another] station were requested \nto assist with other priority calls for service during this time. \nAt about 2250 hours, [Applicant] exited the home. \n* * * \n[Applicant] appeared intoxicated and was slurring his speech . . . .  [AE A at 23-24.] \nc.  Reporting Arrest to Employer.  At the beginning of the hearing, Applicant testified that \nhe promptly reported his arrest to his employer. Tr. at 17. Later in the proceeding, Department \nCounsel cross-examined Applicant regarding a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) \ndocument. This document reflects that, when Applicant did not show up for work or call-in the day \nfollowing his arrest, a manager requested he be given a wellness check. A Human Resources \nrepresentative called Applicant\u2019s house and left a message. Applicant\u2019s sister called back stating he \nwas on a special assignment.3 After conducting a further inquiry, Applicant\u2019s management chain \nlearned of his arrest and detention. The JPAS document reflects that Applicant did not notify the \ncompany\u2019s security office of this incident even thougt he holds a security clearance.  Government \nExhibit (GE) 4 at 1 and 2. In his testimony, Applicant claimed the JPAS document is inaccurate but \nalso noted the first time he had an opportunity to speak to someone at the company was not until \nafter his release from custody, which occurred on March 5th\u2014five days after his arrest. Tr. at 62-64. \nd. Attempted Removal of the Firearms. While Applicant was still in custody on March 4th , \ndeputies executed a search warrant of his residence. When they arrived on the scene, the deputies \ndiscovered Applicant\u2019s friend and sister collecting his firearms in the house for transportation to his \n3 Applicant testified that he did not talk to his sister before she called his company.  Tr. at 100. \n6 \n\nmother\u2019s house. The friend had removed Applicant\u2019s firearms from safes and placed them in boxes, \ncases, or protection socks. The deputies informed Applicant\u2019s friend and sister that they could not \nremove the firearms. This occurred about two hours before Applicant\u2019s preliminary hearing and the \nday before his release from custody. AE A at 42. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he \ncontacted his friend and sister to request them to move the firearms. When asked why he did so, \nhe first responded, \u201cJust hearing the horror stories of this litigious state and how anti-gun this state \nis, I was just concerned that having them in the house would be a bad thing and until everything \nblows over.  And I thought that was probably a good legal thing to do just to get them away.\u201d Tr. \nat 80. Such testimony tends to indicate that Applicant had requested removal of the weapons to \nconceal them from the sheriff\u2019s department. Shortly after Applicant made that quoted statement, the \nJudge asked him directly if the firearms were being removed because some of them were illegal. \nApplicant then stated he was removing them to protect them from being damaged or destroyed by \nthe sheriff\u2019s department. Id. at 81. At the very least, the evidence reflects that Applicant understood \nthe sheriff\u2019s department would be searching his house, he knew there were illegal assault weapons \npresent in the house, and he was attempting to have his friend and sister remove the weapons before \nthe deputies conducted the search. \nThe above listed circumstances raise significant questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and credibility. The Judge failed to factor these aspects of the case into \nhis mitigation analysis. Although the Board is required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1), the Judge is expected to explain why an applicant\u2019s version \nof the events is worth of belief when it is contradicted by other evidence. Failure to do so suggests \nthat the Judge merely substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record \nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019). \nIn his mitigation analysis, the Judge concluded the domestic violence incident was as \u201can \naberration of [Applicant\u2019s] normal conduct\u201d and highlighted the \u201csingularity of the incident.\u201d \nDecision at 8. He concluded Applicant\u2019s assault weapons conviction was mitigated due to his \ncharacter evidence and previous \u201cunblemished personal and professional conduct\u201d Id. Although \nthe domestic violence incident and assault weapons conviction were separate and distinct offenses, \nthey should not have been considered in a piecemeal manner.4 Instead, they should have been \nanalyzed together for what they reveal regarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. See \nRaffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860, 866-867 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have \na significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation).   \nThe evidence establishes both offenses occurred recently. \nNeither occurred under \ncircumstances showing they were unlikely to recur. For example, while the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s \nunsuccessful attempts to comply with the assault weapons law, the record reflects that Applicant had \nseven assault weapons that he was required to remove from the state, register online, disassemble, \n4 The better practice would have been to allege the domestic violence and assault weapons offenses in separate \nSOR allegations. In this regard, it merits noting that it may be difficult to discern exactly which offense(s) a Judge has \nconcluded an applicant committed when he or she has found against the applicant on a single SOR allegation that alleges \nmultiple offenses.   \n7 \n\nor modify before the mid-2018 statutory deadline. AE A at 53 and Tr. at 53-54. He failed to meet \nthat deadline and was in noncompliance with the law for approximately six or seven months before \nthe assault weapons were seized.  Tr. at 85. In short, his possession of the assault weapons was a \ncourse of unlawful conduct that spanned a number of months. His explanation for failing to comply \nwith the statute\u2014that he simply forgot because he got caught up in other activities\u2014 offers little to \ndemonstrate his noncompliance of a known legal requirement was a unique event that is unlikely to \nrecur. Moreover, he essentially testified that he was the victim of the domestic violence, and his \nfailure to take anyresponsibilityfor that incident undercuts a conclusion of reform and rehabilitation. \nOverall, the Judge did not provide a meaningful analysis of important aspects of the case. \nApplicant\u2019s security-significant conduct, when viewed cumulatively, has not been mitigated.  We \nconclude that the record as a whole supports Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge appears \nto have substituted a favorable impression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  \nThe State\u2019s Assault Weapon Law \nAfter the Judge issued his decision but before the appeal became ready for the Board\u2019s \nreview, a U.S. District Court declared unconstitutional sections of the state\u2019s penal code that were \nthe basis of Applicant\u2019s assault weapon conviction.5 Applicant\u2019s reply brief contains his Petition for \na Writ of Habeas Corpus based on the district court\u2019s decision. The petition seeks to have a state \ncourt vacate his conviction, set aside his guilty plea, and discharge him from all restraints arising \nfrom the conviction. \nWe are generally prohibited from considering new evidence, such as the petition, on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. However, we have considered new evidence insofar as it bears upon questions \nof due process or jurisdiction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). In \nthis regard, we have also stated that we cannot simply ignore new evidence that raises questions \nabout the fairness of DOHA proceedings. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 2 (App. Bd. May 25, \n2000). The petition that Applicant has presented falls into this latter category and raises mixed \nquestions of law and fact.6 \nIn the decision, the Judge noted the pending challenge to the assault weapons law and \nconcluded that, until the law was \u201cchanged or declared unconstitutional[,]\u201d Applicant was obligated \nto follow it.  Decision at 5 and 8.  We find no error in that conclusion.  We also note that, on June \n21, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an order staying the district court\u2019s \njudgment until resolution of another pending appeal and further order of the court.7 \n5 See Miller v. Bonta, __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2021 WL 2284132 (S.D. Cal. Jun. 4, 2021). \n6 When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See, e.g, ISCR Case \nNo. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \n7  https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I486D2E8ACA4511EBBA4BCF1253044EF3/View/. \n8 \n\nIn light of our resolution of the other issues in this case, we conclude that the ultimate \ndisposition of the controverted statute is of no moment in adjudicating Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Even if the statute is determined to be unconstitutional and, furthermore, even if we were \nto disregard all of Applicant\u2019s conduct that was contrary to the statute, his security-significant \nconduct regarding his ex-girlfriend \u2014including his other questionable conduct, discussed above, \nduring that incident\u2014renders the Judge\u2019s favorable decision unsustainable. \nWe note that Department Counsel submitted a request to file a Supplemental Brief in \nresponse to Applicant\u2019s Reply Brief. We see no need for such a supplemental filing and hereby deny \nthat motion.  \nConclusion \nGiven the record before us, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision does not \nmeaningfully address all the relevant evidence and runs contrary to the weight of the record \nevidence.  The record as a whole does not support the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  \nOrder \nThe Decision is REVERSED.        \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan        \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

In his Appeal Brief, Department Counsel stated that he is \nnot challenging the Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E that pertain to alleged employment \nterminations. Appeal Brief at 2, n.1. Consequently, the alleged employment terminations are not \naddressed in this decision.  Consistent with the following, we reverse. \nApplicant is in his early thirties. He served on active duty in a reserve branch of the military \nfor less than a year and was honorably discharged.  He continues to serve in the inactive reserves. \nHe has three minor children. In 2017, he married and has a stepchild. He was granted a security \nclearance about seven years ago. Due to the conduct discussed below, his security clearance was \nsuspended in 2017, reinstated in 2018, and suspended again in 2019.  \n\u201cApplicant is involved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the mother of \none of his children.\u201d Decision at 3. This relationship has lead to five, possibly six, of the seven \nallegations of criminal conduct, which were also cross-alleged under Guideline E. Their problems \ncenter around child custody issues. In 2015, Applicant filed for custody of the child because the \nmother interfered, if not actually prohibited, his attempts to see the child. After he filed for custody, \ntheir relationship became increasinglyhostile, resulting in repeated criminal complaints against him. \nWhile a custody agreement was in place by July 2016 that did not end the hostilities. Between 2016 \nand 2019, the mother essentially brought domestic violence charges against Applicant, including \nassault, child abuse, and trespassing. The charges set forth in six of the SOR allegations were either \ndismissed (nolle prosequi) or placed on an inactive docket (Stet status). The remaining Guideline \nJ allegation is unrelated to the others. It involved Applicant\u2019s conviction for operating a motor \nvehicle while intoxicated during Mardi Gras in 2017.  \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, another incident occurred between Applicant and the \nchild\u2019s mother during a custody transfer in August 2020. This incident resulted in Applicant being \narrested and charged with malicious destruction of property less than $1,000. This charge has not \nyet been resolved.  Conduct not alleged or otherwise fairly embraced by the SOR may be relevant \nfor certain purposes such as in making a credibility determination; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case \nfor extenuation or mitigation; in assessing the extent to which the applicant has demonstrated \n2 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation; or in performing a whole-person analysis. See, ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nApplicant is remorseful about the situation with the mother of his child. He has obtained \nmutual protective orders and changed the location of the child custody transfers, e.g., at a police \nfacility. He provided character references attesting to his talents, versatility, and outstanding morale \ncharacter.  His military evaluations reflect that he is a proven performer who meets or exceeds the \nreported performance traits.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nDisqualifying conditions under Guidelines J and E were established. However, various \nmitigating conditions under both guidelines apply. \u201cOn each occasion, the women\u2019s version of the \nevents \u2013 the sole source of information presented to the police \u2013 was accepted by the arresting police \nofficers, even when there was little or no independent evidence that her versions were truthful.\u201d \nDecision at 10. There was one occasion when witnesses refuted her allegation that he tried to \nstrangle her. \u201cWith few exceptions, his explanations have gone unrebutted. . . . Examining the \nrather sketchy and incomplete damaging documentary evidence submitted against him, and the \nsubstantial number of dismissals, leads to a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s explanations are essentially \ntrue.\u201d  Decision at 11.    \nThe most recent alleged criminal conduct happened two years ago. Although his child\u2019s \nmother will probably file other criminal charges against him, there are no realistic concerns about \nfuture criminal conduct.  He has taken steps to insulate himself from the ire of the child\u2019s mother. \nHis past history of alleged criminal conduct no longer casts doubt on his worthiness for a security \nclearance.  \nDiscussion \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s \ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

Mar. 14, 2018). \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactoryexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails \nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion.  Id. \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision does not reflect a reasonable \ninterpretation of the record viewed as a whole, citing to testimony and to various pieces of evidence \nthat he contends undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. We find these arguments to be persuasive. \nCriminal conduct raises doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 30. We note \nthe following, drawn from the Judge\u2019s findings as well as the record evidence.  \nIn mid-2015, the mother reported a physical confrontation with Applicant to the \npolice. Earlier in the evening, Applicant had the child who was scheduled to attend \nschool the next morning. When he returned the child about 40 minutes late, the \nmother yelled at him. He then approached closely to her yelling.  She pushed him \naway. He grabbed her by the arms, pushed her to the ground, and held her there for \na period. When she called 911, he left the scene. The police officer observed minor \nscratches on her arm.  She declined to press charges because he was in the military \nand she did not want to cause trouble for him. Government Exhibit (GE) 8 at 19-20. \nThis incident was neither alleged in the SOR nor discussed in the Judge\u2019s decision. \nIn late 2015, the child\u2019s mother reported to the police that Applicant broke into her \nresidence, stole items, and damaged her property. He had lived at her residence three \nyears earlier, and she believed he still had a key. After attending a sporting event, the \nmother returned home to find her flat screen television lying on the floor, its power \ncord was cut in two places, and the power cord to her Christmas tree lights was also \ncut. The police report contains pictures of the damaged property. She further \ndiscovered that her child\u2019s birth certificate and Social Security card were taken from \nthe binder in which she kept important documents. In the previous months, \nApplicant had asked multiple times for the child\u2019s original birth certificate.

GE 8 at 23-27.  This incident is not discussed in the Judge\u2019s decision.1 \nIn early 2016, the child\u2019s mother reported to the police that Applicant would not \nleave her apartment without the child.  GE 7 at 4. At this point, they did not have a \ncustody agreement. Applicant testified a custody agreement was not in place until \nChristmas of 2016. Tr. at 39-40. The responding police officer asked Applicant \nquestions\u2014such as do you have any identification on you\u2014but he ignored the \nquestions. The police officer ordered Applicant to exit the residence and the \nproperty. The police officer followed Applicant out of the residence and into the \nstairwell. When Applicant would not comply with the order to exit the building, the \nofficer advised him he was trespassing and needed to exit the building. Applicant \nthen took two steps and stopped completely. Upon finally exiting the building, \nApplicant leaned against an exterior window. The officer told him he was \ntrespassing and he needed to leave the property. As the officer was closing the \nexterior door, Applicant placed his foot in the doorway to stop the door from closing. \nThereupon, the officer placed him in handcuffs and transported him to the police \nstation. GE 7 at 4. In his background interview, Applicant reportedly stated that he \nwas trying to leave but \u201cthe police had blocked his car in and was yelling to not let \n[him] leave.\u201d GE 2 at 4-5. When the Judge asked whether he put his foot in the \ndoorway, Applicant testified that he did not get his foot out of the way in time. Tr. \nat 75. The charges against Applicant for failure to obey a reasonable and lawful \norder and trespass on private property were later dismissed.  GE 3 at 3-4; Tr. at 30, \n38-40, and 74-75; Decision at 3. \nIn mid-2016, the mother invited Applicant to her residence to see the child.  When \nhe attempted to leave with the child, the mother told him he could not do so. She \nreported that he then pushed her against a wall and started strangling her with both \nhands for about three minutes. She stated he let her go when he realized their child \nwas watching. As he attempted to leave the residence with the child, the mother \nstarted pulling on his shirt. She claimed he pushed her down and held both of her \nshoulders down at the bottom of the stairs. The police officer noticed redness on the \nside of the mother\u2019s neck and a scape on her shoulder. Photographs were taken of \nApplicant\u2019s and the mother\u2019s injuries. A witness who lives in the building stated she \nheard a loud argument, opened the door, and saw Applicant on top of the mother. \nApplicant claimed the mother was pulling on him and they fell at the bottom of the \n1  The SOR\u00b6 1.e alleged that Applicant was charged with trespass on private property, malicious destruction of \nproperty less than $1,000, and disorderly conduct in mid-2016.  These charges are listed in Applicant\u2019s Criminal History \nRecord (GE 3 at 4-5), which set forth no underlying facts regarding them.  In January 2017, a failure to appear warrant \nwas issued.  Id.  In March 2017, the charges were dismissed.  Id.  Applicant testified he could not recall these charges. \nTr. at 28-29 and 76.  The Judge found that no facts regarding them were submitted.  Decision at 4.  In the Appeal Brief \nat 6-7, Department Counsel contends that these charges arose from the mother\u2019s report to police about the unlawful entry \ninto her apartment in late 2015, but that link has not been sufficiently established.    \n5 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstairs.

GE 3 at 4; \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) D at 10; Tr. at 28-30, 41-43, and 75-76; Decision at 3-4. \nDuring Mardi Gras in 2017, Applicant drove a vehicle after consuming too much \nalcohol. He was stopped by police and administered a breathalyzer, which registered \n0.98. He pled guilty to operating a vehicle while intoxicated, was fined $900, and \nordered to perform 40 hours of community service. Tr. at 28, 35, 42-43, 69-70, and \n76-77; GE 3 at 2. \nIn the fall of 2018, Applicant and his wife met with the child\u2019s mother and her \nboyfriend in a mall to transfer custody of the child. After the exchange of verbal \ncomments and gestures, \u201ca mutual physical assault occurred.\u201d Decision at 4. The \nchild\u2019s mother claimed Applicant strangled her and allowed his wife to scratch her \nface. \nPhotographs were taken of Applicant\u2019s and the mother\u2019s injuries. An \nindependent witness reported that all four individuals were involved in a bawl, but \ndid not recall Applicant choking the child\u2019s mother. Id. The following day, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with assault and reckless endangerment. All \ncharges were later dismissed. GE 6; GE 8 at 8-18; AE D at 3; Tr. at 27-28, and 43\u00ad\n44. \nWhile Applicant had custody of his child in early 2019, he learned the child received \na referral at school for striking another child and for not listening. He disciplined his \n6\u00bd year old child by smacking her bottom with a cloth belt. He claimed he did not \nbruise the child. When the child was returned to the mother\u2019s custody about four \ndays later, she learned of the spanking and noticed bruises on the child\u2019s thigh and \nwrist. The police and Child Protective Services were notified. The child was placed \nin the mother\u2019s emergency protective custody. A warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s \narrest. He was charged with child abuse and reckless endangerment. Applicant \nadmits using corporal punishment to discipline the child but denies abusing the child. \nIn mid-2019, the charges were placed on the inactive docket. Applicant was required \nto attend anger management and avoid unlawful contact the child. GE 5 at 1-17; Tr. \nat 27, 36, 45-50, 52-56, 65-66; Decision at 4-5. \nIn early 2019, Applicant was arrested for six counts of violating release conditions \nand one count of failure to obey court order. GE 4 at 4. Applicant testified these \nwere related the child abuse charge. Tr. at 50. The Judge found these arose from \nalleged violations of release conditions for charges discussed above. Decision at 5. \nIn mid-2019, all of these charges were placed on the inactive docket.  GE 3 at 6-7; \nTr. at 23-24, 26-27, 50-52, 65-66, and 68-69. \nDuring a custody transfer in the parking lot of a state police barracks in the summer \nof 2020, Applicant removed a watch that had a GPS tracking capability from the \nchild\u2019s wrist.

The mother attempted to returned the watch to the child who \nwas in Applicant\u2019s car. As the mother was holding the handle of the door to \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle, he proceed to drive away, almost running over the mother\u2019s foot. \nApplicant then threw the watch from the vehicle and drove off. Applicant was \ncharged with malicious damage to property for defacing the mother\u2019s vehicle. \nApplicant testified that the mother kicked his vehicle and reached inside hitting him \nin the face. This charge is pending. GE 9 at 4; GE 10 at 1-7; Tr. at 30-32, 52-55 and \n77-78; Decision at 5.     \nApplicant denied losing control or escalating the situation during these incidents and \ndenied having anger issues.  Tr. at 56-57. \nAs Department Counsel contends, the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence is flawed. In this \nregard, it first merits noting the Judge\u2019s generalized conclusion that \u201cAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) \nfully or partially applied\u201d (Decision at 10) is defective because it leaves the Board guessing the \ndegree to which particular mitigating condition applied to specific allegations. \nAs we have \npreviously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the \nBoard to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03026 at 4, n.4 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). \nIn the mitigation analysis, the Judge concluded that Mitigating Condition 32(c), no reliable \nevidence to support that the individual committed the offense, applied. He reasoned there was little \nor no independent evidence to show the mother\u2019s accusations were truthful and referred to the \nevidence as \u201csketchy.\u201d Decision at 11. He also stated that the decisions of law enforcement \nauthorities to dismiss the charges based on the mother\u2019s accusations leads to the conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of those events are essentially true. Such reasoning is not sustainable for \nvarious reasons. First, absent record evidence of the specific reasons why criminal charges are not \npursued, a Judge cannot legitimately make assumptions or draw inferences about the reasons state \nauthorities dropped the charges.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0360 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). \nSecond, the charges against Applicant for failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order to exit the \nmother\u2019s apartment building and trespass on private propertyare not based on the mother\u2019s statement \nbut instead on the police officer\u2019s interactions with him. Third, the contradictions between \nApplicant\u2019s and the police officer\u2019s version of that incident raise questions about his credibility. \nWhile the Board is required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1), the Judge is expected to explain why an applicant\u2019s version of an event is worth of belief \nwhen it is contradicted by other evidence. Failure to do so suggests that the Judge merely substituted \na favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019). Fourth, there is record evidence corroborating aspects of \nthe mother\u2019s accusations, such as photos of her injuries, the statement of the neighbor who saw \nApplicant on top of the mother in the stairway of the apartment building, the statement of the \nindependent witness who observed them brawling in the mall, and the statement of the child about \nApplicant hitting her with the belt. The Judge ignored these multiple examples of corroborating \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence in his analysis of the case.  Fifth, a DOHA Judge must consider the evidence as a whole, \nrather than in a piecemeal manner, in rendering a decision. Directive \u00b6 6.3. When viewed in its \nentirety, the evidence in this case does not support a conclusion that Applicant was an innocent \nvictim who was merely acting in self-defense during the incidents involving the child\u2019s mother. \nInstead, the evidence shows that he repeatedly participated in, or instigated, arguments with the \nmother that escalated into what can be fairly described as mutual assaults. The Judge even described \none of the alleged incidents as a \u201cmutual physical assault.\u201d Decision at 4. Applicant\u2019s pattern of \nengaging in such confrontations and assaults sufficiently establishes he engaged in conduct raising \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines J and E.  \nIn apparently concluding Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is not recent, the Judge noted \nApplicant\u2019s DWI conviction occurred four years ago and his most recent alleged criminal conduct \noccurred two years ago. He also stated \u201c[a] person should not be held forever accountable for \nmisconduct in the past.\u201d  Decision at 11. In that analysis, however, he ignored that Applicant was \ncharged with malicious destruction of property in 2020 and that charge has not yet been resolved. \nAdditionally, while recognizing \u201cother criminal complaints will probablybe filed against [Applicant] \nby the same woman[,]\u201d the Judge inexplicably concluded there is \u201cno realistic concerns about future \ncriminal conduct\u201d and his past criminal conduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Id. Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Mitigating \nCondition 32(d), there is evidence of successful rehabilitation . . . , applied in this case is undercut \nbyApplicant\u2019s denials of committing most of the alleged offenses, his failure to accept responsibility \nfor them, and his failure to refrain from engaging in such conduct for any meaningful period. In \nshort, the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis is not a reasonable interpretation of the evidence. Rather, the \nrecord as a whole supports Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge appears to have \nsubstituted a favorable impression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, \nand contrary to law. It fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the record \nevidence.  The record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under the Egan standard. \n8 \n\n             \n                \nOrder \nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan           \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

On May \n15, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On December 15, 2020, after considering the record, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30 \nand raised the following issues: whether Applicant was denied due process and whether the Judge\u2019s \nadverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the reasons stated below, we \nremand.  \nApplicant represented himself below. For about the past 16 years, he has worked overseas \nfor various defense contractors. The SOR alleged that he had six delinquent debts totaling about \n$35,700. In responding to the SOR, he admitted three of the debts with explanations and denied the \nothers. The Judge found against him on five of the six allegations, noting the lack of documentation \nsupporting his claims of debt resolution. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts he was denied due process. He contends that he \n\u201crequested for an extension of time on numerous occasions from Department Counsel via the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) as well as what additional documentation was required, and his requests were ignored.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 2.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents from outside the record to support his claimed \ndenial of due process. These documents consist of email exchanges between Applicant and the \nDCSA CAF (marked as Appellant Exhibit A) and documents from creditors, a computer screen shot \nfrom a credit union, and a copy of check (marked as Appellant Exhibit B). Generally, the Appeal \nBoard is prohibited from considering new evidence (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29); however, we will consider \nnew evidence to address threshold issues such as jurisdiction and due process. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 8, 2015).  \nThe record reflects that Applicant responded to the SOR on June 1, 2020. Department \nCounsel submitted her File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 20, 2020. The record contains \nno signed receipt from Applicant showing when he received the FORM. On October 13, 2020, \nDOHA received an undated FORM Response from Applicant. In that response, Applicant stated he \nreceived an \u201ceyes-only package\u201d (the FORM) on August 29, 2020, and he requested \u201can extension \nof at least 30 days[.]\u201d FORM Response at 1. The record does not reflect whether Applicant sent his \nFORM Response to DOHA directly or to DCSA CAF, which then forwarded it to DOHA. In an \nemail to Applicant on October 13, 2020, Department Counsel noted that his FORM Response was \ndue on September 28, 2020 (30 days of its receipt), and she granted him an extension to submit \nadditional matters until October 30, 2020.

Appellant Exhibit A also contains an email that Applicant sent to DCSA CAF on \nOctober 29, 2020, indicating that he did not receive a follow-up to his last email, that he had resolved \nall but one of the accounts, and that he sent a payment on the remaining unresolved account but it \nwas not received and was resubmitted by certified mail. This later email also noted that one of \nApplicant\u2019s accounts was being paid down on schedule and he was waiting verification that some \naccounts had zero balances. He further asked to be informed \u201cif there was any further information \nI can send in to assist in this case.\u201d The salutations in both of these emails to DCSA CAF were \naddressed to Department Counsel. Consequently, Appellant Exhibit A reflects that Applicant \napparently thought he was communicating with Department Counsel when he was sending emails \nto DCSA CAF and that he apparently did not receive Department Counsel\u2019s email of October 13, \n2020, granting him an extension to submit additional matters until October 30, 2020.      \nNeither a Judge nor Department Counsel are authorized to act as an applicant\u2019s advocate. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-02329 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015). In the past, we have also stated \nthat DOHA personnel have no authority to provide advice to applicants concerning what rights they \nshould exercise and should refrain from going beyond the language of the Directive and, if \napplicable, the current Prehearing Guidance in their interactions with applicants. See, e.g., ADP \nCase No. 18-00329 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2018). That said, we also recognize that it is not \nuncommon for a Judge or Department Counsel to ask a pro se applicant if he or she has any \ndocuments that would corroborate his or her claims that alleged debts are resolved or being resolved. \nBased on the above, Applicant submitted an email to the Government before the extension \nexpired for him to submit matters. In that email, he provided an update on the actions he has taken \nto resolve the debts and asked whether he needed to submit further information. Department \nCounsel and the Judge should have been provided a copy of that email. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-02119 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2020)(remanded when FORM response was sent to the adjudicator \ninstead of Department Counsel). The case file presented to the Judge did not contain the email \nApplicant submitted. It is, of course, unknown how much weight the Judge would have given this \nemail or what action he may have taken regarding it.  Given these circumstances, we conclude the \nbest course of action is to remand the case for the Judge to consider Appellant Exhibit A, to take any \nappropriate action, and to issue a new decision in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. Applicant \nhas raised other issues that are not ripe for consideration at this time. The Board retains no \ncontinuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a decision issued after remand may be \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. to E3.1.35.

Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On April 8, 2021, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Paul J. \nMasondenied Applicant\u2019s request for a securityclearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  For reasons stated below, we remand the decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 delinquent student loans totaling about $67,800. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent accounts. The Judge noted that Applicant \nneither submitted a response to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) nor \ncorroborated her claims about the student loans. The Judge found against Applicant on each of the \nalleged student loans, concluding there are no indications her indebtedness is being reduced or is \nunder control.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises a due process issue. In support of that issue, her brief contains \nassertions and screen shots of text messages that were not presented to the Judge for consideration. \nThe Appeal Board is generally prohibited from considering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nHowever, we may consider new evidence insofar as it bears upon questions of due process or \njurisdiction.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.  17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018).  \nIn her brief, Applicant basically contends that she submitted matters in response to the \nFORM that were not presented to the Judge.  Specifically, she states: \nPlease be advised that on December 7, 2020, my FSO [name deleted] stated \nthat he would be sending me a packet to complete and turn in as soon as possible. \nI received the package on December 8, 2020.  The next day on December 9, 2020, \nI was able to complete all the necessary information and send it off to the address \nprovided in the body of the email.

Once the package . . . which contained \nevidence of my financial aid payments and deferments along with responses to the \nallegations on why some of my loans were not paid on time. This package was \ndetailed and contained information that would have allowed the judge more evidence \nto use to base his/her decision on. As shown in the screen shots, once I sent the \npackage off, I did not receive any correspondence from [the FSO] until January 13, \n2021, stating he received the packet, and it always shows the email chain insinuating \nthat it was sent to the wrong address that he would redirect the packet to the correct \naddress. For months following, I would email [the FSO] and call him with absolutely \nno luck. I was finally able to receive the decision \u201cunfavorable\u201d after months of \nattempting to receive an update on my case from my FSO.

In short, these communications support her \ncontention that she submitted a timely response to the FORM that did not make it into the record. \nHer appeal brief also indicates that she is living overseas, which also may have complicated \ncommunications.  \nBased on the above, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge \nto reopen the record to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. As provided \nin Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge shall, upon remand, issue a new decision in the case.  The Board \nretains no continuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision.

Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On March 23, 2021, after considering the record, Administrative Judge \nDarlene D. LokeyAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a securityclearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had nine delinquent debts totaling about $38,500. Applicant \nadmitted eight of those allegations. The Judge found each alleged debt remained unresolved and \nnoted Applicant expressed a willingness to payoff the debts but did not provide documentation \nshowing he had resolved any of them. The Judge concluded that Applicant failed to mitigate the \nalleged security concerns.   \nApplicant asks \u201cthe Appeal Board members use their independence to render a fair and \nimpartial decision of granting my security clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant is correct that, \nunder Directive \u00b6 5.2.13, we are provided with independence to render fair and impartial decisions. \nHowever, we have limited authority. As set forth in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32, our scope of review is \nlimited to addressing material issues raised by the parties to determine whether the Judge committed \nharmful error in his or her decision.  We do not review cases de novo.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nInstead, he challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions and her weighing of the evidence. For example, he \nclaims that he has made significant progress in paying off his indebtedness.  This argument is not \npersuasive. Applicant failed to provide documentation corroborating his efforts to resolve the debts. \nAs the Appeal Board has previously stated, it is reasonable for a Judge to expect that an applicant \nshould present corroborating documentation of actions taken to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020).  \nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not properly apply the whole-person concept. He \nnotes, for instance, that his debt is decreasing, that the debts arose because of a divorce, that he \nignored the debts because he did not want to think about the divorce, that he is a valued and trusted \nemployee, that he has no personal conduct issues, and that he has never had any issues involving his \naccess to classified information. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel \nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to \nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable \nevidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an \nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the \nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.

Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On May 4, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his thirties, is married, has a master\u2019s degree, and works for a defense \ncontractor. In a 2012 security clearance application, he admitted using marijuana about five times \nin 2008 and 2009.  After being granted a security clearance in 2012, he used marijuana about four \nadditional times. He referred to his conduct as being \u201cstupid and immature.\u201d Decision at 2, citing \nto Tr. at 20.  He signed a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future.  \nEven though Applicant asserts he intends to abstain from future drug involvement, his use \nof marijuana after being alerted to the Government\u2019s concern and being granted a security clearance \nis troubling and reflects a pattern of not being trustworthy. His last usage occurred was as recent as \n2018, when he was not an immature teenager but instead was in his mid-to-late twenties. While he \nis given credit for his honesty in disclosing his marijuana use, he has not been mitigated the drug \ninvolvement security concerns. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. He argues, for example, that his illegal drug use was infrequent and isolated \ninstances of poor judgment that occurred over three years ago and that the Judge did not consider \nhis drug abuse evaluation from a licensed clinical social worker. \nApplicant\u2019s alternative \ninterpretation of the evidence, however, is not sufficient to demonstrate error. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). None of his arguments are sufficient to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or enough to show that the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

On \nAugust 31, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June \n2, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nRobert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding he \nfalsified his security clearance application (SCA) and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nApplicant, who is in his thirties, has been working in his current job for over six years. After \ngraduating from a military service academy, he served on active duty for about five years until he \nreceived an under other than honorable (UOTH) discharge.  Married, he has no children. \nWhile on active duty about 10 years ago, Applicant was charged with theft of government \nproperty, making a fraudulent claim against the government, and conduct unbecoming an officer. \nThese charges involve him wrongfully increasing the weight of his household goods in a permanent \nchange of station (PCS) shipment so that he could submit a claim to be paid more money. After the \ncharges were referred to a general court-martial, Applicant submitted a resignation in lieu of court-\nmartial that was approved. Since then, he has filed petitions to upgrade his discharge. Three of \nthose petitions have been denied, a fourth is pending. In completing a SCA in 2017, Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to questions that asked whether he was ever charged with any felony offense, \nincluding under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and whether in the last seven years he was \nfired from a job, quit after being told he would be fired, or left a job by mutual agreement following \nchargesor allegations of misconduct. Applicant received his UOTH militarydischarge within seven \nyears of completing the SCA.     \nIn his resignation request, Applicant apologized for his conduct and said he \u201csubmitted a \nfalse claim for selfish monetary reasons and his actions were shameful and regrettable.\u201d Decision \nat 4. He paid restitution to the government for the amount of the fraudulent claim. At the hearing, \nhe now contends he did nothing wrong, claiming among other reasons that he was set up by the \nmilitary criminal investigative agency, received an improper briefing about the PCS move, and \nevidence against him was falsified. He also contends that, after the court-martial charges were \ndismissed, he did not have to respond \u201cYes\u201d to the SCA questions at issue and his attorney at the \ncourt-martial proceeding told him that as well.    \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. He did not indicate whether he consulted with an \nattorney in filling out the SCA. It was apparent from his testimony that he has not accepted \nresponsibility for his actions. Although the fraudulent claim was submitted about 10 years ago, this \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \noffense was not minor and still casts doubt on his judgment. He also deliberately failed to disclose \nmaterial information on his SCA. \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that he did not deliberately fail to disclose information on his SCA, \nclaiming he had no intent to hide information surrounding his military discharge. In this regard, we \nnote that Applicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact pertaining to the \nfalsification allegations. It is well established that a falsification can be established through \ncircumstantial evidence even in the face of an applicant\u2019s claim that he did not deliberately fail to \ndisclose material information on an SCA.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02345 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n8, 2021). Additionally, we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings about the \nfalsification allegation are based on substantial record evidence or constitute reasonable inferences \nor conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02345 at 3. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge erred in concluding that he falsified his SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. He contends, for example, the Judge did not properly apply the whole-person concept and \ndid not consider his \u201cdistinguished service\u201d in the militaryor \u201cupstandingcharacter[.]\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 1. He also argues he has accepted responsibility for his actions and his former military service has \nengaged in its \u201cshare of wrongdoings[,]\u201d including racist behavior. Id. His arguments, however, \nare neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor \nsufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On \nSeptember 10, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn June 4, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant has worked in the defense industry for about 30 years and has held a security \nclearance for most of that time. The SOR alleged that Applicant owed about $98,900 in delinquent \nFederal taxes for 2007-2018. He admitted he owed about $74,600 in delinquent taxes for 2009\u00ad\n2014. His tax debts arose from him taking early distributions from his 401(k) plan due to a divorce, \nmedical issues, and paying educational expenses for his children. He also experienced a period of \nunemployment in 2015-2016 and incurred penalties for failing to file his tax returns in a timely \nmanner. Although he estimated his Federal tax liability was over $100,000 in 2020, IRS documents \nreflect that liability was about $54,000 in early 2021. He has consulted with tax professionals and \nsporadically attempted to resolve his tax liability over the years, but it has been primarily reduced \nthrough credits applied from his more current tax years. His financial situation is otherwise stable. \nHe did not act responsibly in attempting to resolve his substantial tax debts.  His unwillingness to \nabide by the tax rules and regulations casts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. He argues, for example, that the Judge did not give appropriate weight to his \nmarital separation and divorce, medical issues, unemployment, and efforts to resolve the tax liability. \nNone of his arguments, however, are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the evidence in the record nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence \nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01495 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 30, 2020). \nAdditionally, Applicant relies on hearing-level decisions in other cases to argue the Judge \nerred in his analysis of this case. Generally, how particular fact scenarios were adjudicated in other \ncases are not a relevant consideration in the Appeal Board\u2019s review of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n           \n              \nNo. 19-03344 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). None of the hearing-level decisions that Applicant \ncites are sufficient to show the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable. \nOrder \nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan          \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record. On August 26, 2021, after considering the record, \nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his Federal and state income \ntaxes for 2015, 2016, and 2018; that he owed the state about $650 in delinquent taxes for 2015; \nand that he had seven other delinquent debts totaling over $42,000. In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted some of the allegations and denied others. The Judge found against him on \nthe tax allegations and four of the debts totaling about $23,000. The Judge concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems establish disqualifying conditions and there are no indications \nthose problems are under control. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents that postdate the Judge\u2019s decision. The \nAppeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nOn appeal, Applicant noted that Judge found none of the mitigating condition applied even \nthough he found in favor of Applicant on three of the alleged debts. We agree this does reflect an \napparent contradiction because it seems likely that the Judge concluded some of the mitigating \nconditions at least partially applied to the favorable findings. This error, however, was harmless \nbecause it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020). \nIn general, Applicant contends the Judge failed to observe how the mitigating conditions \napplied and, in doing so, erred in his analysis of the adjudicative guidelines. He argues, for \nexample, that his financial problems did not cast doubt on his security clearance worthiness, noting \nthey were dated, infrequent, and resulted from condition largely beyond his control. None of his \narguments, however, are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record nor are they sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a \nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01495 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 30, 2020) \n.  \nIn his brief, Applicant requests that his case be remanded to the Judge so he can have a \nhearing. He notes he never had a hearing and states he is investigating how a decision on the \nwritten record was requested. The record contains a letter signed by Applicant, dated October, 30, \n2020, entitled, Answer to the Statements of Reasons Document. In that letter, Applicant stated, \u201cI \ndo not wish to request a hearing at this time.\u201d Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material, \nItem 4 at 2. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7 provides that \u201c[i]f the applicant has not requested a hearing with \nhis or her answer to the SOR and Department Counsel has not requested a hearing with 20 days of \nreceipt of the applicant\u2019s answer, the case shall be assigned to the Administrative Judge for a \nclearance decision based on the written record.\u201d If Applicant wanted a hearing, he was required \nto request one affirmatively.

See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-02730 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2016).

On \nMay 7, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. In the File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline G allegation and added other Guideline J \nallegations. On October 18, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was charged with various criminal \noffenses on 11 occasions between 2011 and 2018. These charges included domestic violence, \nsecond degree assault, attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, credit card fraud, \npetit larceny, disorderly conduct, violation of protective order, harassment, and electronic mail \nharassment. Applicant was found guilty of attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol \nin 2014 and petit larceny in 2015. In general, the other charges were either dismissed, not \nprosecuted, or expunged from his record. The Judge found against Applicant on all of the \nallegations. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant in essence contends that Department Counsel\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) contains inaccurate facts concerning how he received his clearance \nand the number of his children. However, an error in a FORM, as opposed to one in a Judge\u2019s \ndecision, is not an appealable issue. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00535 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017). In this regard, we note the Judge erred in finding that Applicant had \u201cno children.\u201d \nDecision at 3. Applicant did not disclose that he had children in his security clearance application \nbut did so during his background interview. FORM Items 2 at 20-22 and 3 at 5. The Judge\u2019s error, \nhowever, was harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (an error \nis harmless if it did not likely affect the outcome of the case).  \nAs best we can discern, Applicant appears to contend that, due to inaccuracies and \nomissions in the FORM, the Judge was not aware of important facts in his case. His brief contains \ncourt records that reflect various criminal charges were expunged from his record. Those court \nrecords are in the FORM and were addressed in the Judge\u2019s decision. None of Applicant\u2019s \narguments are either sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence \nin the record or enough to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). Applicant also notes that an adverse decision will have a negative impact on his family, \nbut such a circumstance is not a relevant consideration in assessing an individual\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility.

On June \n19, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On March 31, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesleydenied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings on the sole Guideline B \nallegation and two of the five Guideline F allegations were not raised as an issue on appeal. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his mid-40s, has been working for his current employer for about three \nyears. He served on active duty in the military for 20 years. He was unemployed for about seven \nmonths following his military service. Divorced twice, he has three children. He has earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree.  He held a security clearance while serving in the military. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on three delinquent credit card debts totaling about \n$29,000. Responsibility for these debts was assigned to Applicant in a 2012 divorce decree. He \ndefaulted on these debts due to his limited income, and theywere charged off. Between August 2013 \nand November 2016, he was deployed overseas and did not make payments on the alleged debts. \nBetween 2016 and 2018, he received cancellation of debt notices from the creditors of the three \ndebts. No documentation was presented showing he paid Federal or state taxes on the canceled \ndebts. Applicant had two other more recent delinquent debts, including a home equity loan secured \nby a second mortgage, that he resolved.  In 2020, Applicant completed financial counseling to file \nbankruptcy but apparently never filed for that protection.    \nColleagues and friends hold Applicant in high regard and attest to his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and dependability. \nHis work evaluations reflect high marks for meeting \norganizational requirements and executing assigned responsibilities.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s historyof financial difficulties associated with his long-delinquent home equity \nand credit card debts over a period of years (2013-2019) preclude his taking full advantage of any \nof the potentially available extenuating and mitigating benefits.\u201d Decision at 13. While he \nencountered conditions beyond his control, such as his divorce and military deployments, he failed \nto show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He receives only minimal credit for \nreceiving credit counseling. He has failed to take meaningful voluntary steps to address his \ndelinquent debts.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his reliance on his state\u2019s statute of limitations as a predicate for \nobtaining debt cancellations from SOR creditors 1.b-1.d cannot be equated with \ngood-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors. [Appeal Board citations omitted.] \nWhile his payoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.a home equity loan through his arranged short sale \nin 2019 left the creditor with a short fall of over $20,000 and a potential claim for the \ndeficiency balance as a sold-out junior lien holder, SOR creditor \u00b6 1.a accepted its \npayoff from the sale as payment in full. As a result, this debt, along with the $241 \ndebt owed to SOR creditor \u00b6 1.e, are resolved favorably for Applicant. [Decision at \n14.] \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. For example, he argues that, upon receipt of the cancellation notices, the \nthree credit card debts \u201cwere no longer at issue\u201d and no further action regarding them needed to be \ntaken. Appeal Brief at 5. This argument is not convincing. Resolution of a delinquent debt does \nnot preclude further inquiry or examination regarding it. Even if an alleged debt has been paid or \ncanceled, a Judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debt as well as any previous \nactions or lapses to resolve the debt for what they reveal about the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a \nclearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). It is important to \nremember that \u201cThe Concern\u201d under Guideline F in pertinent part states: \u201cFailure to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18. \nApplicant next highlights that he was deployed from 2013 to 2016, which covers most of the \nperiod between him being assigned the debts in the divorce decree and their eventual cancellation, \nand notes he did not receive billing notices from the creditors during that period. He states he was \n\u201cnot cognizant\u201d of the debts. Appeal Brief at 5. This contention is not persuasive. The Judge \naddressed this issue byfinding: \u201cAlthough he apparentlydid not receive billing notices from his SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d creditors while he was deployed abroad, [Applicant] acknowledged his awareness of his \npayment responsibilities for the debts. (Tr. 63, 68)\u201d Decision at 4. The transcript supports the \nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant was aware of this indebtedness while he was deployed overseas.  \nApplicant also argues that the Judge erred in his application of Mitigating Conditions 20(a), \n20(b), and 20(c). See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c). For example, he \ncontends Mitigating Condition 20(a) should apply because of \u201cthe length of time since the behavior \n. . . and the unusual circumstances that contributed to it, both of which make the behavior unlikely \nto recur.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7. None of his arguments, however, are sufficient to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or enough to show that the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). The Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in permitting his debts to languish for many years without addressing them \nreflects adversely on his national security eligibility is sustainable.  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \n4 \n\n          \n              \nOrder \nThe Decision of the Judge is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn April 28, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process \nbecause the Judge failed to apply the proper adjudicative standard and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse \ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe SOR alleged 17 Guideline B allegations. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on ten \nof those allegations. Those favorable findings were not raised as an issue on appeal and are not \ndiscussed below. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his 50's, was born in Egypt. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s \ndegree in Egypt. He immigrated to the United States in the 1990s. He earned a master\u2019s degree and \nPh.D. in the United States. He has been a U.S. citizen for about 13 years. He has not taken any \naction to renounce his Egyptian citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and three children are dual citizens of the United States and Egypt and \nresidents of the United States. His mother, two sisters, and father-in-law are citizens and residents \nof Egypt. His third sister is a citizen of Egypt who was residing in another Middle Eastern country, \nbut she has returned to Egypt after he completed his security clearance application,.    \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two of his sisters were employed by an entity that may have a \nconnection to the Egyptian Government. At the hearing, Applicant was unsure of their current \nemployment status. His father-in-law also worked for that same entity, was in a semi-retired position \nas recently as 2019, and may be receiving a pension from the Egyptian Government or that entity. \nApplicant communicates with his mother every week or every other week. \nIn 2017, he \ncommunicated with his sisters on a monthlybasis but testified he communicates with them everytwo \nor three months. Between 2009 and 2019, Applicant visited Egypt on 13 occasions. His spouse and \nchildren usually accompanied him on those trips during which they visited family members. \nSeveral terrorist organizations operate in Egypt. In 2014, the most active terrorist group \noperating there pledged its allegiance to ISIS. The U.S. Department of State has assessed Cairo as \na critical-threat location for terrorism directed at U.S. Government interests. The Egyptian \nGovernment does not respect the full spectrum of human rights. \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with family members in Egypt create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause terrorists could place pressure on them in an effort to cause him to compromise classified \n2 \n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Those relationships also create a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. Applicant did not meet his burden of showing that his relatives in Egypt are \nunlikely to come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. classified information. He \nfailed to mitigate the Guideline B security concerns. \nDiscussion \nA Judge is tasked with applying the \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \nin determining whether to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. See, e.g., Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.3; 3.2; 4.2; and Encl 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(c). In his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the \nJudge deprived him of due process by failing to apply the proper standard. We find no merit in this \ncontention.  At points in his argument, Applicant incorrectly refers to the adjudicative standard as \nthe \u201cstandard of clear and consistent.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7 and 9. Based on our review of the Judge\u2019s \ndecision, we find no basis to conclude that he failed to apply the proper adjudication standard. \nApplicant has failed to establish he was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive. \nAs best we can discern, Applicant also appears to be making a distinction between a \n\u201cconcern\u201d and a \u201cdoubt\u201d based on the Judge\u2019s citation to Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399 (9th Cir. \n1990). In the last paragraph of his whole-person analysis, Judge stated, \u201cIt is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F.2d 1401.\u201d Decision at 17, emphasis \nadded.  On the cited page in Dorfmont, the Court stated: \nBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised about an \nindividual\u2019s judgment or loyalty, it is deemed best to err on the side of the \ngovernment\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking clearance. \n[Emphasis added.] \nApplicant is apparently contending that a \u201cconcern\u201d (a term the Judge used) is raised at a lesser \nthreshold than a \u201cdoubt\u201d (a term the Court used) and, therefore, the Judge was applying a lesser \nadjudicative standard than the Court. This contention lacks merit. An admitted or proven SOR \nallegation generally establishes one or more security concerns,1 which create doubt. The terms \n\u201csecurity concern,\u201d \u201cconcern,\u201d and \u201cdoubt\u201d are often used interchangeably in security clearance \ndecisions. Of course, an established \u201csecurity concern\u201d or \u201cdoubt\u201d may or may not be mitigated \ndepending on the evidence presented. \n1   Security concerns are identified in \u201cThe Concern\u201d paragraph of each Adjudicative Guideline.  The applicable \ndisqualifying conditions identify conduct and circumstances that could raise those security concerns.  Directive, Encl. \n2, App. A.  An SOR is intended to place an Applicant on notice of the Government\u2019s allegations of conduct and \ncircumstances establishing security concerns that show why it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.2 and E3.1.3. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brief contends that one of his children is only a U.S. citizen. His testimony \nsupports that contention. Tr. at 29-30. Although the Judge erred in finding all of his children were \ndual citizens of the United States and Egypt, this was a harmless error because it did not likely affect \nthe outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 \nand the Directive by not considering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and whole-person concept. He argues, for example, that his contact with Egypt \nis minimal and his ties there are causal. None of his arguments, however, are sufficient to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or enough to show that the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s brief also highlights that Government Exhibit 2 (the summary of his background \ninterview) provides his foreign contacts have no affiliation with a foreign government and his \nassociation with his foreign contacts cannot be used to blackmail, coerce, or place him under duress. \nThose highlighted comments, however, summarize Applicant\u2019s answers to the interviewer.  They \ndo not constitute the interviewer\u2019s considered opinion as to Applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05344 at 3 (Dec. 6, 2017). In any event, even if an investigator provided \nsuch an opinion, it would not bind the DoD in its evaluation of an applicant\u2019s case.  Id. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On \nSeptember 2, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On June 7, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the \nJudge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his fifties, has retired from the military, has a master\u2019s degree, and works for \na defense contractor. The SOR alleged that he failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2013-2018 and that he owed the Federal Government delinquent taxes for 2014, 2016, and 2017. \nHe attributed his tax filing deficiencies to not having documentation substantiating his deductions \nfor 2013 and 2014. He provided documentation showing he filed all of the alleged income tax \nreturns in April 2020.  He has also paid the delinquent tax liability. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s conduct established a long pattern of procrastination, delay, irresponsible \nbehavior, and violations of law that the Federal government takes very seriously. Applicant did not \nact reasonably or responsibly until April 2020. His inaction for so long reflects a pattern of \nunreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, Applicant does not meet the \nrequirements to access classified information.\u201d  [Decision at 5.] \nDiscussion \nIn his brief, Applicant contends that, even though the Judge made findings of fact that he \nsatisfied his Federal and state tax requirements, she did not consider those facts in her decision-\nmaking process. A plain reading of the Judge\u2019s decision does not support Applicant\u2019s assertion. The \nJudge noted in her analysis that Applicant had resolved the alleged tax deficiencies. Applicant has \nfailed to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020).  As the Board has stated in the past, even if an \napplicant has resolved the alleged financial problems, a Judge may still consider the circumstances \nrelated to those problems in evaluating eligibility to access classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-02246 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant acted \nirresponsibly in resolving his financial problems, which also reflects negatively on his security \nclearance eligibility, is sustainable.  \nIn his brief, Applicant argues that Judge did not carefully consider the evidence. He \nhighlights, for example, that he paid his tax liability, that it was not the result of irresponsible \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n                \nspending, that he had no intent to evade taxes, that he disclosed his tax filing deficiencies on his \nsecurity clearance application, and that he does not live beyond his means. His arguments, however, \nare not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00257 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief fails to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his 40s, works for a Federal contractor.  He is not married and has no \nchildren.  He has an associate\u2019s degree and has never held a security clearance. \nIn 2005, Applicant was convicted of felony possession of marijuana and cocaine and was \nsentenced to two years of probation.  He stopped using cocaine after his arrest. After successfully \ncompleting the probation, his conviction was expunged. He used marijuana from about 1994 to \n2019, including after he submitted his security clearance application. He submitted no evidence of \ntreatment.  None of the Guideline H mitigating conditions are applicable. \nApplicant failed to file and pay, as required, his Federal and state income taxes for 2011\u00ad\n2018. He also failed to file, as required, his Federal and state income taxes for 2010, but did not owe \nany taxes for that year. He has filed his 2018 Federal income tax return but has not paid the $4,137 \nin tax owed for that year. He has two consolidated student loans totaling about $129,000 that have \nbeen referred to collection and has a revolving charge account for $142 that has been charged off. \nHe submitted no documentation showing he has taken steps to resolve those debts. None of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions are applicable. \nDiscussion \nDue Process Issue \nApplicant represented himself in the proceeding below. In his brief, Applicant argues that \nhe was not provided adequate notice of the adjudicative procedures, that he was not provided an \nadequate opportunity to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case, and that he should be \nprovided another opportunity to present his case.  These arguments are not convincing.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn support of his arguments, Applicant cites Londoner v. Denver, 210 U.S. 373 (1908) that \naddresses the application of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution in a challenge to a tax assessment for a street improvement. That decision provides no \nsupport to Applicant\u2019s argument. The due process clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \ndo not apply in DOHA proceedings. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to \nactions taken by the Federal Government, while that clause in the Fourteenth Amendment applies \nto state actions. Both clauses provide that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law.\u201d  An individual, however, has no life, liberty, or property interest in a \nsecurity clearance.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cIt should be \nobvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d). See also Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d \n1399, 1403 (9th Cir. 1990)(\u201c[T]here is no liberty interest in employment requiring such clearance. \nThere is also no protected property interest in the clearance or in a job requiring such clearance.\u201d). \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive\u2014not the U.S. Constitution\u2014set forth an applicant\u2019s due \nprocess rights in a DOHA proceeding. \nFurthermore, contrary to his contention, Applicant was given adequate notice of the \nadjudication process and procedures. He was provided a copy of the Directive when he received the \nSOR. Enclosure 3 of the Directive explains the differences between a hearing and a decision based \non the written record. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 makes clear \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorableclearance decision.\u201d Directive\u00b64.3.4 provides an applicant maybe represented bycounsel \nor personal representative in the proceeding. Applicant chose to have his case decided on the written \nrecord. On November 30, 2020, Department Counsel mailed to Applicant a copy of the File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) that contained the Government\u2019s evidence for the Judge to consider. \nApplicant received the FORM on December 28, 2020. The FORM clearly advised him that he had \n30 days from its receipt to submit objections and documentary information in rebuttal, explanation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response to the FORM and, in doing so, waived his \nopportunity to present such evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00044 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd. May \n17, 2019). His argument that he was not provided adequate notice of procedures or an opportunity \nto present evidence lacks merit.  \nApplicant also contends: \n[T]he notice dated November 20, 2020, does not list specific tailored examples of \nevidence.  Additionally, the notice is written in a way in which a layperson like the \nAppellant could not fully appreciate the determination process. The notice only \nprovides procedural guidelines for determination, but it is purposely absent of \nguidelines referring to evidence requirements for applicants.  [Appeal Brief at 5.] \nThe \u201cnotice\u201d that Applicant is referencing is Department Counsel\u2019s FORM. DOHA proceedings are \nadversarial in nature. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 9 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005). A \nDepartment Counsel is not authorized to advise an applicant on how to present his or her case or to \nserve as his or her advocate. To do otherwise would be inconsistent with his or her duty to represent \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe interests of the United States. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-02329 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015). \nAs discussed above, the Directive provided Applicant adequate notice of the adjudication process \nand procedures, including lists of the applicable mitigating conditions. Thus, even if Applicant\u2019s \ncite to Londoner was only intended to relate by analogy to his case, it fails to be persuasive given \nthe procedural history of the case.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief also contains a Declaration in Support of Remand in which he \ndeclares he had a \u201clack of preparedness, ignorance, and inability to understand the requirements of \npresenting [his] case to the court[,]\u201d a lack of understanding the rights he was giving up by waiving \na hearing, a lack of knowledge of how to file documents with the court, and a lack of knowledge that \nthere were attorneys who specialized in security clearance adjudications. Exhibit A of Appeal Brief. \nAs Department Counsel notes in the reply brief, there is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant, \nas an adult, is legally competent and capable to making rational decisions concerning his actions. \nSee, e.g. ISCR Case No. 01-20579 at 3, (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004). Additionally, an applicant\u2019s pro \nse status does not relieve him of the obligation to take timely, reasonable steps to protect his rights \nunder Executive Order 10865 and the Directive. Id. If Applicant did not understand his rights and \nobligations in the proceeding below, it was not due to any insufficiency in the information that DoD \nprovided him. Neither the Judge nor Department Counsel bear any responsibility for Applicant\u2019s \nlack of understanding of the process and procedures. As it stands, we find no reason to conclude that \nApplicant was denied the due process afforded him by Executive Order 10865 and the Directive. \nAbsent a showing of factual or legal error that affects a party\u2019s right to present evidence in \nthe proceeding below, a party does not have the right to have a second chance at presenting his or \nher case before an administrative judge. Applicant has not demonstrated error below and is not \nentitled to have another opportunity to present his case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02730 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2016).  \nAnalytical Issues \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. He argues, for example, that the Judge failed to consider the passage of time \nsince his drug conviction and that the conviction was expunged after he successfully completed the \nprobation. None of his arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the evidence in the record or enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 3, 2020). \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Moody \nI agree with everything my colleagues have stated regarding the issues under consideration. \nI would like to add some comments about the due process issue. The Appeal Brief asserts that \nApplicant was not properly advised of the sort of evidence that he should present in making his case \nfor mitigation and that he did not understand how he should go about submitting evidence to the \nJudge.  \nUnder Guideline F, the FORM advised Applicant that his financial and tax delinquencies \nraised four disqualifying conditions: Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(a-c), (f): inability to satisfy \ndebts; unwillingness to satisfy debts; a history of not meeting financial obligations; and failure to file \nand/or pay Federal of state tax obligations. The FORM also addressed two possible mitigating \nconditions, Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), (g): that Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose from \ncircumstances beyond his control and that he has acted reasonably under the circumstances; and that \nApplicant has made arrangements to file or pay his taxes. The FORM stated that Applicant had not \nprovided sufficient information concerning whether the conditions leading to his financial problems \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n  \nwere beyond his control, nor had he presented evidence of progress in resolving his debts. In \naddition, the FORM advised Applicant that he had not presented evidence of any effort at resolving \nhis tax obligations, save for one late tax return that has been filed. \nUnder Guideline H, the FORM stated that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised two disqualifying \nconditions, Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (g): any substance misuse; and expressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement or failure clearly to commit to discontinue such involvement. The \nFORM did not identify specific Guideline H mitigating conditions that might apply to Applicant\u2019s \ncase. However, it did cite to problematic aspects of the record, such as the length of time that \nApplicant had used marijuana as well as his failure clearly to commit to abstaining from such use \nin the future, that should have alerted a reasonable person as to a good starting point for developing \na strategy for mitigation and gathering available evidence in support thereof. \nThe FORM was accompanied bya cover letter from Department Counsel in which he advised \nthat Applicant had 30 days in which to provide a response to the FORM and that he had the right to \nhire an attorney at his own expense. The cover letter stated that Applicant could submit his response \nby mail or by email, and it included the appropriate addresses for either choice. In addition, \nApplicant received a copy of the Directive which, among other things, sets forth in detail the various \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions at issue, as well as Applicant\u2019s duty to present evidence in \nmitigation and the time standards within which he should respond.  Despite guidance and advice, \nApplicant presented no evidence at all in response to the FORM. \nA thorough examination of the record shows that Applicant received detailed, case-specific \ninformation from DOHA sufficient to have placed a reasonable person on notice of the concerns \nraised in his case and the sort of conditions that possibly could mitigate those concerns. I note that \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes no citation to any evidence not already in the record that Applicant claims \nhe would have presented but for his purported ignorance of DOHA procedures and requirements. \nAll in all, I find no reason to believe that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the \nDirective. \nSigned: James E.

Applicant requested a decision \non the written record.  On May 19, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Stephanie C. Hess denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $46,000. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on each allegation and noted that, although he stated in his SOR response \nthat he was working with an attorney to resolve the debts, he provided no evidence that he has taken \nany action to do so.   \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts that he did not respond to Department Counsel\u2019s File \nof Relevant Material (FORM) because he became seriously ill. In support of that claim, he provided \na document from a doctor confirming that he was diagnosed with that serious illness during the 30\u00ad\nday period that he was given to respond to the FORM.

Applicant\u2019s new evidence raises due process concerns.  \nBased on the above, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge \nto reopen the record to provided Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence.

The SOR also alleges that Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with felony grand larceny in 2018, later pled guilty to the lesser charge of trespassing, and \nwas sentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended) plus ordered to pay restitution. He admitted being \narrested and pleading guilty as alleged but denied knowingly violating the state\u2019s grand larceny \nstatute pertaining to firearms. \nUpon separating, Applicant and his ex-wife entered into an agreement in which he would \npay child support and his ex-wife would retain the marital residence and refinance it so that his \nname could be removed from the mortgage and deed. For various reasons, the house was not \nrefinanced and his name was not removed from the mortgage. His ex-wife was unable to make \nthe mortgage payments, and the house was foreclosed in 2018 and later sold. In his SOR response, \nApplicant claimed he did not have any remaining obligation under the mortgage. In his background \ninterview, however, he stated that he and his ex-wife owed about $43,000 as a balance on the \nmortgage loan after the sale. Credit reports do not reflect any ongoing indebtedness on the \nmortgage loan. \nCredit reports in the record document Applicant\u2019s other alleged debts and show his \nfinancial problems began as early as 2008 when he was serving in the military. Even though he \nclaimed he did not receive his military retirement pay for several month after retiring, he began \nworking his civilian job the month following his retirement and did not document his inability to \nmeet his financial obligations. Applicant resolved three of the debts in 2020. He disputed another \nbut did not provide corroborating documentation. He also claimed his support obligation has \ndecreased and he can pay his debts while meeting his current financial obligation but did not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nprovide documentation showing his income, current state of his personal finances, and other efforts \nto resolve his debts.  \nA few months before his arrest, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend asked him to pawn one of her \nhandguns to cover unexpected travel expenses. Applicant did so but it turns out that he pawned \nthe wrong handgun. A few months later the girlfriend could not find a handgun that her father \ngave her and reported it stolen. Upon realizing the mistake, Applicant attempted to retrieve the \nhandgun from the pawnshop and learned he would be charged with grand larceny for theft of a \nweapon. Applicant turned himself in to authorities and was so charged. On the advice of an \nattorney, he accepted a plea agreement to trespass, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced as alleged.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant remained jointly responsible for the mortgage when it was foreclosed. Most of \nthe alleged debts remain unresolved. He did not show his debts arose from circumstances beyond \nhis control because he accrued delinquent debts while in the military and before his separation.  \nHe did not document good-faith efforts to resolve his debts or to support his claimed disputes.  \nOverall, he did not meet his burden of production to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nthe alleged debts.   \nDisqualifying Condition 31(b), evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted, applies in this case. Applicant was \ncharged with a felony grand larceny, pled guilty to a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to a \nsuspended confinement and restitution. This conduct is recent. While Applicant claims he did not \nknowingly commit a firearm theft, the fact that the court still imposed a suspended jail sentence \nand ordered him to pay restitution to his girlfriend undercuts any suggestion there was no reliable \nevidence he committed a crime. He did not meet his burden or presenting sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concern arising from his criminal conduct.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions and a document that was not presented to the \nJudge for consideration. The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on \nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he never broke any laws regarding the handling \nor sale of firearms, but he did acknowledge, \u201cA misunderstanding resulted in my having a \npermanent record and some trust issues with my girlfriend.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. To the extent he \nis claiming that he did not commit the alleged criminal conduct, we do not find that contention \npersuasive. We note Applicant provided no documentation, such as sworn statements from his \ngirlfriend, criminal defense attorney, or others, to corroborate his claims regarding the alleged \nconduct. There is no rule of evidence that compels the Judge to accept an applicant\u2019s statement \nmerely because it is not rebutted by record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 (App. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd. Apr. 19, 2000). Applicant has not established the Judge erred in analyzing the evidence \npertaining to the criminal conduct allegation. \nApplicant contends that it is \u201cirresponsible\u201d to link the alleged criminal conduct to a prior \nincident in which he was found to have a 45-caliber handgun ammunition clip in his vehicle when \nentering a military base in 2001.  Appeal Brief at 1.  In the File of Relevant Material, Department \nCounsel argued this earlier incident raised questions about whether Applicant was forthcoming \nregarding the alleged criminal conduct. In the decision, the Judge discounted Department \nCounsel\u2019s argument by stating: \nThis [ammunition-clip incident] is something that was known to the Government \nduring the investigation and adjudication of this case, yet not alleged in the SOR.  \nApplicant was not charged with any criminal offense or reprimanded for any \nadministrative violation at that time. Instead, he received only verbal counseling \nfrom his military chain of command. This information does not demonstrate \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s interest in guns and the sale of guns\u201d and it is not sufficient to impeach \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, even under the whole-person concept. Indeed, the Federal \nRules of Evidence generally would exclude this use of 20-years-old information \neither to impeach credibility or to show a propensity towards the conduct addressed \nin [the criminal conduct allegation].  [Decision at 7-8.] \nApplicant has not shown that the Judge committed any error in his consideration of the \nammunition-clip incident.   \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. He draws our attention to various aspects of the record that are favorable to him \nsuch as his 25 years of service to the Government while holding a security clearance. He also \nhighlights positive circumstances surrounding his financial problems and criminal conduct. His \narguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On \nOctober 16, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On February 10, 2021, after \nthe hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. \nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse findings and \nconclusions under Guideline E are supported by record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse \ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge found in favor of the Applicant on \nthe Guideline D allegations, one of the five Guideline E allegations, and two of the 17 Guideline F \nallegations. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings were not raised as an issue on appeal. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his mid-30s, served in the military for about 13 years. He received an \nhonorable discharge but was ineligible to reenlist due to high-year tenure rules. Since his military \ndischarge, he has earned an associate\u2019s degree and has worked for various employers, including as \na probationary employee of a Federal agency. He is married and has two minor children from a prior \nmarriage and two adult stepchildren.  \nWhile in the military, Applicant was awarded nonjudicial punishment, i.e., a reduction of one \npaygrade to E-4 and a forfeiture of half of his pay for two months, for various offenses. In a security \nclearance application (SCA) completed in late 2019, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to the question that \nasked whether he was \u201csubject to court-martial or other disciplinary procedure under the Uniform \nCode of Miliary Justice (UCMJ) such as Article 15, Captain\u2019s mast, Article 135 Court of Inquiry, \netc.\u201d Decision at 4. During a background interview in January 2020, Applicant also told an \ninvestigator he was not subject to any disciplinary action while on active duty. His failures to \ndisclose the nonjudicial punishment in his SCA or to the investigator were not alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated from a Federal agency \nfor misusing a Government credit card and failing to pay the resulting debt and that he falsified his \nresponses to three SCA questions. The falsification allegations pertain to (1) Applicant answering \n\u201cNo\u201d to the question asking whether his employment at a Federal agency ended in 2016 due to him \nbeing been fired, quitting after being told he would be fired, or leaving by mutual agreement \nfollowing charges or allegations of misconduct; (2) him answering \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking \nwhether, in the last seven years, he had been counseled, warned, or disciplined for violating the terms \nof agreement for an employer\u2019s travel or credit card; and (3) him answering \u201cNo\u201d to various \nquestions asking whether he had any financial delinquencies. In responding to the SOR, he admitted \nthe three falsification allegations.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn a background interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not believe he was fired \nfrom the Federal agencyand he did not receive anywritten or oral reprimands and was not suspended \nfor misuse of the Government credit card. In responding to the SOR, he stated he did not knowingly \nmisuse the Government credit card.  \nAt the hearing, [Applicant] testified that his personal credit card had been stolen, he \ndid not have any cash, and he used the government credit card for food and materials \nthat he needed for his work, such as foul weather gear, while he was on temporary \nduty away from his home and primary duty station. (Tr. 82-85.) He testified that he \ndid not promptly pay off the charges on the credit-card account because he was sent \non another temporary duty assignment. He made some payments on the account but \nnever paid it in full.  (Tr. 86.)  [Decision at 5.]   \nWhile Applicant may not have understood all of the limitations on the use of the Government credit \ncard, he knew that he had not paid charges incurred on that card. He also knew he had serious \nfinancial problems and \u201c[h]is explanation that he did not know that the accounts had been referred \nfor collection is implausible and unconvincing.\u201d  Decision at 11.  \nThe allegation pertaining to the misuse of the Government credit card, noted above, was \ncross-alleged under Guideline F. The Judge found against Applicant on that Government credit card \nallegation and against him on 14 alleged delinquent debts. Most of these debts, including \ndeficiencies from two vehicle repossessions totaling over $25,000, remain unresolved. While he \nexperienced conditions largely beyond his control, such as a divorce and car accident, he did not act \nresponsibly. He disputed some debts but provided no documentation for the basis of those disputes. \nHe testified that he hired a debt-resolution agency but he provided no documentation showing it has \nmade any progress in resolving his debts.  His financial situation is not under control. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \u201cApplicant\u2019s lack of candor in his \nSCA and his lack of financial responsibilityraise serious doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment.\u201d  Decision at 14.     \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s unfavorable Guideline F \nfindings but does challenge his unfavorable Guideline E findings.  \nAlleged SCA Falsification for Failure to Disclose Financial Delinquencies \nRegarding this alleged falsification, Applicant admits in his appeal brief that he knew that \nhe owed debt but states he was going through a divorce and \u201chad other numerous things . . . that \nmade [him] forget about the debt[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. He also claimed he was making payments \non a child support arrearage and, because he was making those payments on time, he was not \ndelinquent on that debt. We do not find these arguments persuasive. In his SOR response, \nApplicant\u2019s admission to this falsification allegation was unqualified. His SCA reflects that his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndivorce occurred more than four years before he completed that document. He does not identify the \n\u201cother numerous things\u201d that purportedly caused him to forget the debts. Credit reports in the record \nconfirm that Applicant had delinquent debts arising from vehicle repossessions, collection accounts, \nand charged-off debts. As provided in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, the Board gives deference to the \nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations, including his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did \nnot know that the accounts had been referred for collection was implausible and unconvincing. From \nour review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s alleged \nSCA falsification for failing to disclose his financial delinquencies are based on substantial evidence \nor constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nRemaining Unfavorable Guideline E Findings \nThe issues that Applicant raises regarding the Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings to the remaining \nthree Guideline E allegations are more complicated. These three allegations are related to \nApplicant\u2019s former probationary employment at a Federal agency. At this point, it merits noting that \nApplicant represented himself at the hearing below and his SOR responses contain inconsistencies \nthat raise questions about whether he intended to admit the two falsification allegations related to \nthat former employment.  \nIn the decision, the Judge found, \u201c[I]n his answer to the SOR, [Applicant] admitted that he \nwas terminated for misuse of the government credit card and \u2018failure to pay obligations.\u2019\u201d Decision \nat 4. This finding is inaccurate. Applicant denied that Guideline E allegation in his SOR response \nand also added the following annotation: \u201c(Was never informed as to why I was terminated besides \nthem telling me I was being laid off)[.]\u201d  SOR Response at 2.  \nApart from Applicant\u2019s questionable admissions to the related falsification allegations \n(discussed below), there is no other admissible record evidence that establishes he was terminated \nfrom the Federal agency for a misused Government credit card or that he was counseled, warned, \nordisciplined for misuse of that credit card. The summaryof Applicant\u2019s background interview does \ncontain the following comments from the investigator: \u201cSubject was advised the investigation \nrevealed he was fired for . . . unfavorable conduct. . . . There was misuse of a government issued \ntravel card and failure to pay obligations.\u201d Government Exhibit 2 at 8. Applicant, however, \ndisagreed with those comments during his background interview. The summary of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview states in pertinent part: \nSubject does not know why his behavior or conduct would be in question as he did \nnot have any issues with anyone. His written evaluation was good and he had no \ndisciplinary actions whatsoever. The reason he can\u2019t remember what the issue was \nwith the travel card is because it was too long ago. He did not list he was fired on the \nsecurity questionnaire because he does not believe he was fired. He did not list any \ndisciplinary actions because he did not receive anywritten/oral reprimand and wasn\u2019t \n4 \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nsuspended. . . . Subject does not admit to any wrong doing while using the travel \ncredit card so he did not knowingly participate in any adverse behavior. He does not \nthink that [the Federal agency] should have any reasons for adverse information \nregarding his trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, lack of candor or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations.  [Government Exhibit 2 at 8.] \nExcept for acknowledging at the hearing that he still owed a portion of the Government credit card \ndebt, Applicant never admitted that the investigator\u2019s above-quoted comments were accurate or \nadopted those statements as his own. An investigator\u2019s allegation by itself is not sufficient to prove \nthat the alleged event or conduct occurred. Based on our review, the record does not contain \nsufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s adverse finding that Applicant was terminated from the \nFederal agency for the alleged misconduct. \nAs a related matter, Applicant\u2019s denial of the above allegation\u2014as well as his annotation in \nthe SOR response that the Federal agency only informed him that he was being laid off\u2014contradict \nhis admission to the allegation that he falsified his SCA by failing to disclose that he was terminated \nfrom that agency due to misuse of the Government credit card. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s admission \nthat he falsified his SCA by failing to disclose that he was counseled, warned, or disciplined for \nmisuse of the Government credit card was qualified by his statement in the SOR response that \u201c(I \ndidn\u2019t knowingly misuse the Gov\u2019t credit card)\u201d and contradicted by statements he made in his \nbackground interview and during his hearing testimony. Tr. at 82-95. Applicant essentially testified \nthat he did not become aware of the alleged misuse of the Government credit card until after his \nsecurity clearance adjudication began.   \nIn short, Applicant\u2019s statements in his SOR response, background interview, and hearing \ntestimony contradict his SOR admissions to the falsification allegations that pertain to his former \nFederal employment and are sufficient to raise significant questions about whether he understood \nwhat he was admitting. He was not specifically questioned at the hearing regarding these \ncontradictions nor questioned about his understanding of the nature and scope of those admissions. \nIn the decision, the Judge did not address these contradictions.  \nDespite the above issues, any errors the Judge may have made regarding these three related \nGuideline E allegations were harmless because they likely had no impact on the outcome of the case. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). The Judge\u2019s adverse findings \nregarding the Guideline F allegations and the falsification pertaining to Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose his delinquent debts were sufficient to support the denial of his national security eligibility. \nWeighing the Evidence \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant also contends that he is not a national security threat, that he \nis a \u201cstand-up citizen,\u201d and that he follows rules and regulations. He argues there is no reason why \nhe should not be granted a security clearance. These arguments amount to a disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                \n                  \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18\u00ad\n02592 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On July 9, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his forties, has never been married, and has two children. He attended a \nuniversity but has not received a degree. He was granted a security clearance nearly 20 years ago. \n\u201cApplicant has a history of financial difficulties going back over a decade that have resulted \nin many accounts becoming delinquent. The SOR alleged three financial issues regarding \nbankruptcies . . . .\u201d Decision at 2. In October 2010, Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge. Between December 2010 and January 2016, he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy on seven \noccasions. Each Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed. In August 2019, he again received a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy discharge. \nAlthough Applicant noted he was burdened with paying his father\u2019s funeral expenses, he \n\u201cmaxed out\u201d his credit cards on travel, clothing, and dining out. Decision at 3. \u201cHe acknowledged \nthat he had over-extended himself financially, and did not think he would be able to pay his debts, \nso he filed for bankruptcy. (Items 8 at 9) With respect to his travel expenses, between August 2015 \nand April 2019, Applicant took several international trips to Mexico (three occasions), as well as \ntrips to Jamaica, Barbados, Belize, Honduras, and Costa Rica. (Item 3, at 22-43), with his most \nrecent trip occurring in April 2019 \u2013 one month before he filed his May 2019 bankruptcy petition.\u201d \nId. His current monthly income and expenses are unknown. He owes over $83,000 in student loans. \nApplicant did not establish that he took any good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. His \nrepeated reliance on bankruptcy proceedings to discharge his debts continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant stated, \u201cThe liabilities debts that were reported byAdministrative Judge \nin the Statement of The Case were incorrect and that my total liabilities debts in the previous years \nhave been corrected/updated, satisfied and reduced to much lower amounts estimated around \n$170,000 dollars.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. It is unclear which liabilities Applicant is referencing. To the \nextent he is challenging the Judge\u2019s findings about his liabilities reflected in the Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petitions, we find no errors in those findings. In this regard, the Judge made the \nfollowing findings: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[In his first Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, Applicant] reported approximately \n$257,986 in liabilities with creditors holding secured claims (state tax lien; a \njudgment lien, a vehicle, and a mortgage); $4,000 in liabilities with creditors holding \nunsecured priority claims (federal income tax); and $69,137 in liabilities with \ncreditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims (various commercial accounts, credit \ncards; a time-share; and student loans). \n* * * \n[In his second Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, Applicant] reported approximately \n$199,829 in liabilities with creditors holding secured claims (a mortgage), and \n$99,956 in liabilities with creditors holding unsecured priority claims (domestic \nsupport obligations to two separate women, commercial accounts, credit cards; and \nstudent loans).  [Decision at 3.] \nA review of Applicant\u2019s first and second Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions confirm that the liabilities \nlisted in the above findings are accurate. Applicant has failed to establish the Judge erred in his \nfindings regarding his liabilities.  \nApplicant points out that he is in good standing on his current debts, he is enrolled in a \nstudent loan forgiveness program, and he has created a budget to manage all his expenses and lives \nwithin his means.  He argues that his \u201cpast financial history is a thing of the past\u201d and should not \npreclude him from being granted a security clearance. Appeal Brief at 1. This argument is not \npersuasive. It is well established that, even though debts may have been discharged in bankruptcy, \na Judge may still consider the underlying circumstances for what they reveal about an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02246 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). The \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant history of financial problems continues to cast doubt on his \nsecurity clearance eligibility is sustainable. In other words, Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient \nto establish that the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. Applicant also notes that the loss of his securityclearance will have an impact \non his livelihood. The Directive, however, does not permit us to consider such consequences. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02020 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed harmful error.  The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, who is in his 30s, has been working as an independent subcontractor since the fall of 2019. He is married with two children. He has served in the National Guard. Department Counsel asserts, without providing documentary verification, that Applicant was granted a security clearance in 2008. The SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent debts totaling about $24,700. Each of these accounts was charged off between late 2017 and the spring of 2019. While he experienced a period of unemployment for about three months between 2013 and 2014, he attributes his financial problems to more recent factors, i.e., inconsistent income while he served in the National Guard and the termination of his wife\u2019s employment when she became pregnant and remained home to care for their first child. In February 2021, Applicant obtained a debt-consolidation loan of about $20,000 to address his debts. With this loan, he resolved three of the alleged debts totaling over $20,000. His efforts to resolve the fourth debt of about $4,490 were rebutted by the collection agent because the debt was pending assignment to another collection company. Applicant failed to submit any documentation showing he has made payments on the debt-consolidation loan. Despite his financial difficulties, Applicant made three trips to Europe between 2017 and 2019 to visit his wife\u2019s family.

He is married with two children. He has served in the National Guard. Department \nCounsel asserts, without providing documentary verification, that Applicant was granted a security \nclearance in 2008.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent debts totaling about $24,700. Each of \nthese accounts was charged off between late 2017 and the spring of 2019. While he experienced a \nperiod of unemployment for about three months between 2013 and 2014, he attributes his financial \nproblems to more recent factors, i.e., inconsistent income while he served in the National Guard and \nthe termination of his wife\u2019s employment when she became pregnant and remained home to care for \ntheir first child.  \nIn February 2021, Applicant obtained a debt-consolidation loan of about $20,000 to address \nhis debts. With this loan, he resolved three of the alleged debts totaling over $20,000.  His efforts \nto resolve the fourth debt of about $4,490 were rebutted by the collection agent because the debt was \npending assignment to another collection company. Applicant failed to submit any documentation \nshowing he has made payments on the debt-consolidation loan.   \nDespite his financial difficulties, Applicant made three trips to Europe between 2017 and \n2019 to visit his wife\u2019s family. These trips varied in length between 6-20 days. \u201cApplicant\u2019s \nPersonal Monthly Budget reports $4,400 in current net monthly income; $3,513 in monthly \nexpenses, including $829 for the consolidation loan; and a monthly remainder of $887 that might \nbe available for discretionary spending or savings.\u201d  Decision at 4. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThree mitigating conditions fully or partially apply. These are Mitigating Conditions \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; 20(b), the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 20(d), \nthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. Applicant claimed he had insufficient funds to pay his debts because his wife stopped \nworking upon becoming pregnant and because his income was inconsistent while serving in the \nNational Guard. \u201cIt is troubling that although Applicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status, he managed to take several personal trips to [Europe] in \n2017, 2018, and 2019.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \n\u201cApplicant seemingly ignored his delinquent accounts until five months after the SOR was \nissued.\u201d Id. However, he has resolved three of the four accounts alleged in the SOR, and his efforts \nwith respect to the fourth account have been rebuffed by the collection agent. \u201cWhile the timeliness \nof his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, the subsequent substantial positive and successful \nefforts are very good.  His strong showing that most of the accounts are now resolved, or about to \nbe resolved, along with the amount of money that is available for discretionary spending or savings \neach month, indicates that the financial problems are substantially in the past.\u201d Decision at 8. The \nmitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial, \u201cbut still not exactlycompelling.\u201d \nDecision at 9. \u201cThis decision should serve as a warning that Applicant\u2019s failure to more timely and \naggressively resolve the one remaining debt for $4,491, or make timely monthly loan consolidation \npayments, may adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance as security officials may \ncontinue to monitor his finances.\u201d  Decision at 10. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or \nproven facts. The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of \nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2 \nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails \nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel contends that the record in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s \nmitigation and whole-person analysis. She persuasively argues that the Judge erred in his analysis \nof the evidence.  \nA security clearance decision must be an overall common sense determination based on \ncareful consideration of the adjudicative guidelines. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(c). In this case, \nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has made a \u201cstrong showing that most of the accounts are now \nresolved\u201d does not take into consideration an important aspect of the case, i.e., whether Applicant\u2019s \nmitigative efforts have actually improved his financial situation. When viewed from a macro \nperspective, the mitigative value of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his financial problems remains \nuncertain. He obtained a debt-consolidation loan to pay three of the four alleged debts. In effect, \nhe substituted one form of indebtedness (credit card debt) for another form (a debt-consolidation \nloan) or, looking at it in a different way, he converted old debt into new debt. He did not provide \ndocumentation setting forth the details of the debt-consolidation loan or show that he has made any \npayments toward this new loan. The evidence he presented fails to demonstrate that his financial \nsituation has improved, fails to establish any meaningful track record of payments to reduce the \nindebtedness at issue, and fails to show that his financial problems are under control.  In short, he \nhas failed to prove his total indebtedness has been resolved in any significant manner. While we \nrecognize that a debt-consolidation loan may be beneficial to an applicant in certain circumstances, \nwe are unable to discern, based on the facts in this case, how merely substituting one form of debt \nfor another, without more, reduces the security concerns arising from the alleged debts. As \nDepartment Counsel argues, Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts amount to a promise to pay the \nindebtedness in the future, which is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely \nmanner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). \nDepartment Counsel argues that, even though the Judge discussed many of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial shortcomings, he effectively disregarded them in his analysis. We agree. For example, the \nJudge found that Applicant failed to take any action on the alleged debts until five months after he \nreceived the SOR. In his analysis, the Judge also cited ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2018) for the proposition that an \napplicant who begins taking action to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. Yet, the Judge \nsummarily dismisses this issue by stating, \u201cApplicant\u2019s delayed actions under the circumstances no \nlonger cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).\u201d1 Decision at 8. The Judge provided no analysis \nsupporting that conclusion, which is not sustainable based on the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s lack \nof action in addressing his delinquent debts over the years and his inconclusive efforts taken to \n1 The Judge fails to explain how the cited Appeal Board decision supports his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s delays \nno longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. After reviewing that decision, we do \nnot see how the cited decision supports that conclusion.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolve them only after receiving the SOR and Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material \nundermine any conclusion that he acted responsibly or in good-faith under the circumstances. The \nmitigative value of Applicant\u2019s purported corrective action is significantlydiminished because it was \nnot initiated until well after his security clearance was placed in jeopardy. \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to consider \nan important aspect of the case and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. Furthermore, \nwe conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard.

Applicant requested a hearing. On August 18, \n2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nLeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his forties. He has been working for defense contractors for over 20 years \nand has held a security clearance during that employment. He is divorced with no children. The \nSOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his Federal and state income tax returns for \n2009-2011 and 2015-2018. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the tax filing \ndeficiencies for 2015-2018 and denied the earlier ones.   \nIn a 2012 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he had not filed \nhis Federal and state tax returns for 2009-2011. During a background interview, he attributed that \nfailure to \u201cnot getting around to doing it.\u201d  Decision at 2, quoting from Government Exhibit (GE) \n3 at 4. In a 2019 SCA, he disclosed that he had not filed his Federal and state income taxes for \n2015-2017.

At the hearing, Applicant noted that his more recent tax filing deficiencies began \nwhen he separated from his wife, he dreaded doing taxes, and the pending hearing motivated him \nto file his returns. He claimed that, in 2014, a tax professional prepared his Federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2009-2011but provided no documentary evidence to show they were filed. \nAs of October 19, 2020, his IRS tax transcripts reflect that he had not filed his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2016-2018. \nIn May 2021, Applicant completed his Federal and state income tax returns for 2014-2019.  \nHe was entitled to Federal tax refunds for each of those years. He did not provide documentation \nshowing those returns were filed.  A credit report reflects all of his debts are current.  None of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions were fully established. \u201cFailure to file tax returns suggests an \napplicant has a problem with complying with well-established rules and systems.\u201d Decision at 6. \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his failure to file his Federal and state \ntax returns in a timely manner. The Judge indicated that, even if Applicant had filed his tax returns \nfor 2015-2018, such action would not have change his decision. \nDiscussion \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts, for example, that he self-disclosed his tax filing \ndeficiencies, he has filed his tax returns for 2014 and 2018 and qualifies for tax refunds for those \nyears, his credit report reflects zero late payments on his debts, and he lives within his means.

Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nApplicant is in his sixties, is married, and has adult children. He honorably served in the \nmilitary and retired with a service-connected disability. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and has \npreviously held a security clearance. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted six of the seven allegations. He admitted with \nclarifications that he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes totaling about $102,000 for \n2014-2017 and he failed to file as required his state income tax returns for 2015-2018.  The Judge \nfound against him on the allegations he admitted and in favor of him on the allegation he denied. \nIn his 2018 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he was working with a \ntax specialist to prepare the delinquent Federal and state income tax returns for 2014-2017. He \nattributed the tax filing delinquencies to various reasons, including loss of income from rental \nproperties, repair and management expenses for the rental properties, sale of a rental property at a \nloss, unemployment, a significant reduction in income at a new job, family members passing away, \nliving apart from his wife, and his wife\u2019s medical problems. In his January 2019 background \ninterview, Applicant stated his goal was to have all of his delinquent tax returns filed by September \n2019.  \nApplicant\u2019s IRS Transcripts reflect that he filed his 2013 tax return in October 2015, the IRS \nfiled substitute tax returns for him for tax years 2014-2017 in 2019 and 2020, and he filed his 2018 \ntax return in December 2020. In July and October 2020, Applicant filed his Federal and state income \ntax returns for 2014-2017. Applicant\u2019s 2019 and 2020 Federal and state tax returns were filed in \nMarch 2021 and May 2021, respectively.     \nIn September 2019, Applicant proposed to pay the IRS within five months about $76,600, \nthe tax liability for 2014-2016. The IRS accepted the proposal but Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments. In January 2021, Applicant proposed to pay the IRS within \nfour months about $126,900, the tax liability for 2014-2017. The IRS accepted this later proposal \nbut Applicant presented no documentary evidence of any payments. Applicant has promised to file \nhis future tax returns in a timely manner and to expeditiously pay any delinquent taxes.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge acknowledged that Applicant may owe less taxes than those reflected on the \nsubstitute tax returns that the IRS filed for him because he may be entitled to exemptions, credits, \nand deductions that may not have been previously considered. Nevertheless, he still owes taxes for \nseveral years.  \nAlthough Applicant experienced conditions beyond his control that contributed to his \nfinancial problems, he failed to establish he acted responsibly under that circumstances.  Of note, \nhe failed to make a good-faith effort to file his tax returns in a timely manner or to pay his delinquent \nincome taxes.  His recent actions to resolve his financial problems were not sufficient. \nMitigating Condition 20(g) applies because Applicant filed all of his late income tax returns \nand made payment arrangements with the IRS for the delinquent taxes, but those efforts do not \nmitigate the security concerns. In this regard, his delay in filing the tax returns and his failure to \ndocument any payments under the payment arrangements are important factors to consider. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant stated: \nSignificantly, the Judge erred in some of his findings of fact. He wrote that \n[Applicant] owed $23,387 to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) in the Tax Year \n(TY) 2014. The amount due for TY 2014 is actually $22,387\u2014an amount that is \n$10,000 less that [sic] what was specified in the opinion. [Appeal Brief at 2.] \nIn the decision, the Judge noted that the SOR alleged Applicant owed \u201c$23,387 for TY 2014[.]\u201d \nApplicant is correct that amount is inaccurate. The SOR alleged that Applicant owed $22,387 to the \nIRS for that year, which is an apparent typographical error of $1,000. We also note the Judge \ncorrectly found later in the decision that Applicant\u2019s IRS Tax Transcript, dated May 31, 2021, \nreflected he owed $23,213 to the IRS for TY 2014, citing Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) W-2 as \nsupporting evidence. Decision at 3. The Judge\u2019s error regarding the amount alleged in the SOR was \nharmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nIn his brief, Applicant also contends \u201c[t]he Directive places no time limit for a security \nclearance applicant to mitigate possible concerns that the government might have.\u201d  Appeal Brief \nat 8. This statement, although correct, does not take into account that an applicant\u2019s handling of \nalleged financial problems is examined to determine whether he or she acted in a manner that \ndemonstrates a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. As quoted by the Judge in his \ndecision, the Appeal Board has previously stated, \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who begins to resolve \nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nover time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests. [Decision at 11, \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017).] \nWe find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to resolve his financial \nproblems \u201care too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns.\u201d  Decision at 13.   \nApplicant\u2019s brief argues that the Judge did not consider all the relevant evidence and did not \nproperly weigh the evidence. In making such arguments, he highlights, for example, the conditions \nbeyond his control that have impacted his financial problems. None of his arguments are enough \nto rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or sufficient to \nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01649 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nIn his brief, Applicant requests \u201ca probationary period be instituted.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. To \nthe extent that he is requesting a conditional security clearance, we conclude that Applicant has not \nestablished that the granting of an exception under Appendix C of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \nmerited.  \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record. On June 7, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For \nreasons stated below, we remand the decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had nine delinquent debts totaling about $55,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent accounts. The Judge noted that \nApplicant did not submit a response to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM). \nThe Judge found against Applicant on each SOR allegation, noting he failed to present \ndocumentation of a payment history that showed progress in resolving the debts.   \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises a due process issue. His brief contains a declaration signed \nby him that asserts he emailed a response to the FORM before the deadline and contains copies of \ndocuments that he claims were submitted with that response. In this regard, the Appeal Board is \ngenerally prohibited from considering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. However, we may \nconsider new evidence insofar as it bears upon a question of due process. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo.  17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018).  \nWe note that Applicant\u2019s FORM response was apparently sent to the wrong address. The \ncover letter forwarding the FORM to Applicant indicated that his response should be sent to a \nDOHA Legal Assistant. Contrary to that guidance, he emailed his response to an address at the \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency (DCSA). Although Applicant did not comply with the directions provided in the cover \nletter, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge to reopen the record \nto provide Applicant an opportunity to submit the FORM response he sent to the DCSA CAF. \nAs provided in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge shall, upon remand, issue a new decision in \nthe case. The Board retains no continuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a \ndecision issued after remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. through E3.1.35. \nApplicant\u2019s brief contains other assignments of error that are not ripe for our consideration at this \ntime. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

On \nNovember 23, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2013securityconcerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record. On June 28, 2021, after considering the record, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his analysis of \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his sixties, works for a Defense contractor, employment that he has held \nsince 2014. He previously worked for the same contractor from 2007 until 2012. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2008.  \nIn 2014, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in which he denied \nillegal drug involvement. In a 2018 SCA, he disclosed occasional marijuana use from 2015 to late \n2017, for a total of about five instances. He admitted to having used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance and stated that he intended to use marijuana in the future. \nDuring a 2019 background investigation, Applicant stated that he began using marijuana \n\u201csometime before August 2012.\u201d Decision at 2. He stated that he continued to use marijuana after \nhaving been awarded a top secret clearance in 2010 and reiterated that he intended to use the drug \nin the future.  He stated that he only used marijuana in states in which it had been decriminalized. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he: (1) used marijuana from April 2018 \nto the following July, after having completed his SCA; (2) purchased marijuana after having \ncompleted his 2018 SCA; (3) used marijuana from 2015 to 2018 while holding a clearance; (4) \npurchased marijuana after having been granted a clearance; and (5) intended future use of marijuana. \nHe also admitted to using marijuana once in 2019 and once again in 2020. \nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use, including instances while holding a \nsecurity clearance and in probable violation of his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy. Although \ncommending Applicant\u2019s candor in admitting his security-significant conduct, the Judge cited to the \nrecency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and his professed intent to use it in the future. The Judge \ncharacterized Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation as consisting in large measure on \u201crationalizations or \nminimizations or both.\u201d Decision at 6. The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden \nof persuasion regarding mitigation. \nDiscussion \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not challenged the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. Rather, he argues \nthat the Judge erred in concluding that he had not mitigated the concerns raised in the SOR. He \npresents several arguments, including that (1) there is no social stigma regarding marijuana use and, \ntherefore, no risk of blackmail; (2) he has held a clearance for many years without incident or \nconcern; (3) his use did not rise to the level of substance abuse; (4) marijuana has been \ndecriminalized in many states; and (5) he never came to work under the influence of marijuana.  \nThe Directive provides that \u201cillegal use of controlled substances . . . raises questions about \na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, \nApp. A \u00b6 24. This paragraph defines \u201csubstance misuse\u201d as a generic term to describe, inter alia, \nthe conduct just quoted. It does not limit Guideline H concerns to habitual drug use. Rather, the \nDirective provides that any use of an illegal drug can raise security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 12-06635 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2014). This clearly addresses the kind of use to which \nApplicant has admitted. We note Applicant\u2019s argument that many states have legalized marijuana \nfor medical purposes or have simply decriminalized it. However, marijuana use remains an offense \nunder Federal law. The Judge cited to a memorandum bythe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nto the effect that states do not have authority to contravene Federal drug laws and that an applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana \u201cremains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d DNI \nMemorandum, dated October 25, 2014, at 2. This memorandum has not been rescinded and sets \nforth policy that a DOHA Judge must bring to bear in arriving at a clearance decision under \nGuideline H. We have long held that applicants who use marijuana after having been placed on \nnotice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability \nexpected of those with access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). In the case before us, Applicant\u2019s SCAs and pre-employment drug test \nwere sufficient notice that use of marijuana is not compatible with maintaining access to classified \ninformation. When viewed as a totality, and in light of Applicant\u2019s multiple statements of intended \nfuture marijuana use, the evidence that was before the Judge supports his overall adverse conclusion. \nWe note Applicant\u2019s contention that he has held a clearance for years without incident. This \nmatter is entitled to little weight under the facts of this case. The government need not wait until an \nindividual mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable \nsecurity clearance decision. Even those with good prior records can exhibit behaviors that call their \njudgment into serious question. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. The \nrecord supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On June 24, 2021, after \nconsideringthe record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Gina \nL. Marine denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nApplicant is in his thirties, is married with children, and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He was \npreviouslygranted securityclearances. About six years ago, he was terminated from a job for misuse \nof his company\u2019s computer system byaccessing sexually explicit material and for labor mischarging. \nApplicant was first counseled by his supervisor about appropriate use of company assets and labor \ncharging after a coworker observed him viewing nude images. About two months later, an \ninvestigation revealed that Applicant accessed sexually explicit images on seven days during a nine-\nday period and engaged in an excessive amount of non-work web activity. The employer concluded \nApplicant mischarged roughly 42% of his time, which amounted to over $13,000. Later, a military \nservice proposed debarment of Applicant for the mischarging, but that action was resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. It was determined he no longer posed a threat to the integrity of the government \nprocurement process.  \nApplicant attributed his misconduct to a pornography addiction. He has since sought and \nreceived counseling to overcome his addiction and to prevent relapses. About four years ago, a \ncounselor opined Applicant would make a full recovery. \nAbout three years ago, Applicant was terminated from a job during a probationary period for \nunacceptable work performance and conduct. This included a lack of teamwork and argumentative \nand discourteous behavior, which negatively impacted the mission.  He attributed this termination \nto an inability to communicate effectively and denied any malicious intent.  He has since received \ncounsel from his wife and friends to better understand effective ways of interacting with coworkers. \nIn his 2016 Declaration of Federal Employment, security clearance application (SCA) and \nbackground interview, Applicant omitted that he had viewed sexually explicit material and \nmischarged labor when reporting the first employment termination noted above. In a subsequent \nSCA and background interview, he disclosed more details, but still understated the reasons for his \nsecond employment termination. In a December 2019 background interview, he \u201cacknowledged that \nhe had not gone into \u2018extensive detail\u2019 about the actual reasons for the [first] termination \u2018due to the \nembarrassing nature of the situation.\u2019\u201d Decision at 4.

He has failed \nto mitigate the alleged security concerns.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends the Judge\u2019s \u201cdecision is against the great weight of the evidence.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. He argues, for example, that the first termination happened a long time ago, that \nhe has received counseling, that the debarment action concluded he was not a threat to the integrity \nof the procurement process, that he has worked hard to reform himself, and that he has earned the \nconfidence of his current fellow workers and security professionals. He also explained his non\u00ad\ndisclosure of the details about his first employment termination as an \u201cabhorrence to the person I \nused to be and a desire to move on by stating the facts generally and moving on\u201d and to not \ncommitting the details to memory. Appeal Brief at 1. His arguments amount to a disagreement with \nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. None of his arguments are enough to rebut the presumption \nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or sufficient to show that the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief also contains character reference letters that post-date the Judge\u2019s \ndecision.

The Judge found that Applicant \u201cstated in her Answer \nthat unemployment was the reason for two bankruptcies in 2010 and 2011.\u201d Decision at 2. The \nJudge did not make a specific finding for the reason whyApplicant\u2019s 2010 bankruptcywas dismissed \nbut found that her 2011 bankruptcy was dismissed due to unemployment and subsequent inability \nto make bankruptcy plan payments.

In discussing these bankruptcies, the Judge also \nfound, \u201c[Applicant] acknowledged that she takes responsibility for not downsizing and changing her \nliving habits as she should\u201d after her income was reduced significantly when she medically retired \nfrom a state job she held for almost 20 years. Id. at 2. This latter finding was supported by \nstatements Applicant made in her SOR response.  Item 2 at 3. \nTo the extent that Applicant may be challenging the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions that \ngambling had an impact on her financial situation, we do not find that contention convincing.

There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge \nis impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of \npersuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). In her brief, \nApplicant has failed to identify any matter in the Judge\u2019s decision or in her processing of the case \nthat would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to question her fairness or impartiality.  \nAs best we can discern, Applicant contends the Judge erred in considering her first \nbankruptcy because it was filed over 32 years ago and she was young at that time. This argument \nis not persuasive. Each of Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filings was relevant evidence for the Judge to \nconsider in determining whether Disqualifying Condition 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations[,]\u201d was applicable. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 19(c). The Judge committed no \nerror in concluding that disqualifying condition applied in this case. \nIn her arguments, Applicant further asserts that the Judge gave no consideration to the two \nbankruptcies she completed in 1995 and 2008, that she is a single individual with marginal income \nwho is caring for an elderly parent, and that she is within months of becoming debt free, except for \nher student loans, upon completing her current Chapter 13 bankruptcy. None of her arguments are \nenough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or \nsufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02728 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2019). Applicant \nalso notes she has not had access to classified information during the past year and a half in her \ncurrent job. As the Board has stated in the past, we have no authority to consider the extent to which \nan applicant may or may not actually have access to classified information in the course of his or her \nemployment.  Id. \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. Based on our \nreview of the record, the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision.

On \nDecember 14, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On June 1, 2021, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Robert \nRobinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and \nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his forties, began serving in his current position sometime after \nsubmitting a security clearance application in April 2018. He served on active duty in the military \nfor about six years, including in a combat zone, received an honorable discharge, and continues to \nserve in the reserves. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. Married, he has two children. It is unclear \nwhether he was previously granted a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had three delinquent debts totaling about $52,400. Two of \nthose debts were student loans. In responding to the SOR, he admitted the debts had been delinquent \nbut denied they were still in that status. He experienced periods of unemployment before and after \nhis active-duty military service. In his background interview in June 2018, \u201che characterized his \nfinances as not currently in a good state.\u201d Decision at 3. In responding to interrogatories in March \n2020, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement that reflected he had a monthlyremainder \nof $1,720 available for discretionary purposes. Applicant presented documents that established the \nthree debts have been resolved.  \nApplicant claimed to be so embarrassed by having delinquent accounts that he had \nnot told his wife of their financial situation. He planned to tell her \u201csoon\u201d and \nintended to seek financial counseling. It is unclear if he did either. Based on the \nevidence, it appears that Applicant ignored his delinquent accounts for approximately \ntwo and one-half years after he was questioned by the OPM investigator. He waited \napproximately seven month after he was issued a set of interrogatories regarding his \ndelinquent student-loan accounts. Only then, three months before the SOR was \nissued, did he take action to resolve the delinquent accounts, basically at a substantial \ndiscount. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there \nis no immediate threat to his or her own interests. . . . Applicant\u2019s delayed actions \nunder the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.

He asserts it was based solely on his 2018 background interview and did not take into \nconsideration his December 2020 interview in which he provided updated information regarding how \nthe accounts were resolved and who had knowledge of his financial problems. He stated he could \nnot provide a copy of that interview because he did not have one. We note the month in which this \nsecond interview purportedly occurred is the same month the SOR was issued and Applicant \nanswered it by providing documents the Judge relied upon to conclude the alleged debts were \nresolved.      \nTo the extent that Applicant is contending he was denied due process because the Judge did \nnot consider the purported second interview, we do not find that argument persuasive. On February \n5, 2021, Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant. He \nacknowledged receipt of the FORM on February 12, 2021, and was given 30 days from its receipt \nto file objections or submit additional matters for the Judge to consider. The FORM contained seven \nexhibits that represented the Government\u2019s evidence. The FORM advised him that, if he did not file \nobjections or submit additional matters, his case would be assigned to a Judge \u201cfor a determination \nbased solely on this FORM.\u201d FORM at 4 (emphasis added). The cover letter forwarding the FORM \ncontained the same information. Applicant was responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel, and he had \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable clearance decision. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. If Applicant wanted the Judge to consider matters that were not contained in the FORM, \nit was his obligation to provide that information. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM \nand, by failing to do so, he forfeited his right to submit such evidence. He has failed to establish that \nhe was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive.   \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes other assertions about the debts and his efforts to resolve \nthem that are not contained in the record.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. In arguing that the Judge\u2019s decision is wrong, for example, he points out that he has \nnot had any other financial problems and his current financial situation is good. None of his \narguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record or sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On August 10, 2021, \nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his analysis of \nthe falsification and debt allegations.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her twenties and is employed by a Federal contractor. She has never been \nmarried and has no children.  She has attended college but has not earned a degree. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a consumer collection account, 12 delinquent medical \naccounts totaling about $3,700, and five student loans in collection totaling over $15,000. It also \nalleged that she falsified her 2019 security clearance application (SCA) by failing to disclose any \nof her financial delinquencies. In responding to the SOR, she admitted each of the allegations. \nDuring her background interview, she stated the omission of her financial delinquencies in her \nSCA was an oversight. In her answer to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nshe stated that she did not intend to falsify her SCA. She indicated that she believed that either \nher father or an insurance company were paying her debts.  During her background interview, she \nnoted the IRS began confiscating her income tax refunds in 2017 to apply those funds to her \ndelinquent student loans. She presented no documentary evidence of any payments made on the \nalleged accounts, of contact with creditors, of financial counseling, or of her current financial \nsituation. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts are still ongoing and unresolved. While she experienced \nperiods of unemployment and other struggles, the evidence is insufficient to conclude she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Insufficient evidence was submitted to demonstrate that she \nis financially responsible. When Applicant submitted her SCA, she was aware her student loans \nwere delinquent because the IRS was confiscating her income tax refunds. She deliberately \nfalsified her SCA to cover up her financial problems. She failed to mitigate the alleged security \nconcerns. \nDiscussion \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that the omissions in her SCA were \u201can \nunintentional oversight.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. She argues that she had no idea of the scope of her \nfinancial problems.

Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1. We find no reason to disturb the unfavorable credibility determination the Judge made \nin concluding she deliberately falsified her SCA. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s \nmaterial findings and conclusions regarding the SCA falsification are based on substantial \nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-02345 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2021).  \nApplicant acknowledges that she has been struggling financially over the past years, now \nrealizes her mistakes, and is taking steps to rectify situation as quickly as possible.

He has earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree. He served honorably in the U.S. military and has not held a security clearance since the \nmilitary. \nThe SOR contains four allegations.  The Judge found against Applicant on two delinquent \nstudent loans totaling about $49,500. In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted those allegations.  \nHe became delinquent on the student loans about six years ago when his income decreased. He \nindicated that he asked for a deferment but provided no corroborating documentation. In 2019, he \nthought he participated in a rehabilitation program by making $5 monthly payments. At some \npoint, the two loans were consolidated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, his student loan \npayments were suspended until further notice.  He is not currently in default.  \nThere is insufficient proof that Applicant took any meaningful steps to resolve the student \nloans for a number of years. The fact that these loans are not currently in a default status is not \ndue to any action taken by Applicant. He has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial indebtedness.   \nDiscussion \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in the findings of fact. We examine disputed findings \nto determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. See also ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2018). \nApplicant first argues that Judge erred when \u201c[s]he wrote that [Applicant] merely received \na reduction in pay in 2004.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3, citing Tr. at 84. This assertion is not an accurate \ncharacterization of the Judge\u2019s finding. When the Appeal Board examines individual words or \nsentences in a Judge\u2019s decision, we do not consider them in isolation. Rather, we consider them \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin light of the decision in its entirety.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02181 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, \n2019).  In this case, the Judge found: \nApplicant acknowledged that he has always paid his bills and paid earlier student \nloans from 1990 to 1996. However, in 2004 his salary was reduced, and he fell \nbehind on some bills, but he obtained two jobs and paid his credit card debts. \nApplicant presented documentation that he paid a loan of $11,024 in 2017 (Ex. J, \npage 30) He even made double payments on his car note in 2012. (Tr. 37) He \nworked for a security firm from 2004 until March 2015. (Tr. 39)  Before 2015, he \nstated that he made about $44,000 to $49,000 a year due to overtime. (Tr. 41) He \nalso stated that before 2015, he was making a salary of $50,000 to $60,000 with \novertime.  (Tr. 20).  [Decision at 2.] \nThe Judge did not state \u201c[Applicant] merely received a reduction in 2004.\u201d Instead she was \nhighlighting his track record of paying debts before the student loans at issue became delinquent.  \nWe find no error in the Judge\u2019s findings regarding his financial situation in 2004. While Applicant \nmay have preferred that the challenged finding was drafted differently, such dissatisfaction does \nnot demonstrate error. Judges have broad latitude and discretion in how they writes their decisions. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-02752 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2010).  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in finding there was no proof of him sending \na check to a state tax authority. We agree the Judge erred in this finding. The reverse side of the \ncheck reflects that it was endorsed by the state tax authority. Even though the Judge erred in this \nfinding, it was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020).  Of note, the check in question relates to an SOR \nallegation in which the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nAdditionally, Applicant argues that he entered into a rehabilitation program for the student \nloans in 2019 and, \u201c[a]s a result of that action,\u201d those loans are no longer delinquent. Appeal Brief \nat 6.  To the extent he may be claiming the Judge erred in finding the consolidated student loan is \nno longer in default due to the presidential suspension of student loan payments during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, we do not find this argument persuasive. See generally, ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n01527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2021) and ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2021) for \nexamples of delinquent student loans subject to the presidential suspension that were not mitigated. \nIn this case, a credit report (Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 3) reflects Applicant\u2019s consolidated \nstudent loan account had a balance of over $50,000 in August 2020. Except for providing a \ndocument showing a $5 payment towards the consolidated student loan that would be processed \nin February 2020 (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) I), Applicant presented no other documentary \nevidence of payments towards those loans. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s challenged \nfinding that Applicant\u2019s consolidated student loan was no longer in default due to the presidential \nsuspension of payments was a reasonable inference drawn from the record evidence. Furthermore, \neven if Applicant\u2019s consolidated student loan is no longer delinquent as a result of his participation \nin the rehabilitation, the Judge could still consider that he failed for a number of years to take \nmeaningful action to address the debts in assessing his national security eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017) (even if an applicant paid a debt or is making \npayments on a debt, a Judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debt as well as \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany previous actions or lapses to resolve the debt for what they reveal about the applicant\u2019s \nworthiness for a clearance).  \nMitigation Analysis \nApplicant further argues the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed the \nevidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. He \ncontends, for example, the student loan debt is not recent, notes he experienced conditions beyond \nhis control that contributed to his indebtedness, and argues he has a willingness to resolve his \nfinancial problems. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption \nthat the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Applicant also argues the Judge considered non-alleged \nconduct (a failure to pay income taxes as required) for an impermissible purpose. A fair reading \nof the Judge\u2019s decision does not support this assertion of error. The Judge considered the non-\nalleged conduct for a permissible purpose, i.e., evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017) (setting forth the limited purposes \nfor which non-alleged conduct may be considered).   \nIn arguing there is no doubt about his security clearance eligibility, Applicant notes the \nsummary of his background interview reflects \u201c[t]here is nothing in Subjects background that can \nbe used to place Subject in a position to be blackmailed or coerced.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7, quoting \nfrom AE D. \nThis quoted statement does not denote the interviewer\u2019s opinion regarding \nApplicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance. \nRather, it represents Applicant\u2019s answer to the \ninterviewer\u2019s question. In any event, even if an interviewer offered such an opinion it would not \nbind DoD in its evaluation of an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-05344 at 3 (Dec. 6, 2017). Applicant also asserts that he does not have access to classified \ninformation in his job.  However, whether or not an applicant has access to classified information \nis not a relevant consideration in determining his or her national security eligibility. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 18-02728 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2019). \nBias \nApplicant argues the Judge was biased against him and took advantage of his pro se status. \nHe also contends the Judge made a handful of intemperate remarks throughout the hearing and in \nher decision. For example, he takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cBecause he wanted a \nsecurity clearance, he contacted a company in 2019 to start a payment arrangement.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 12, quoting from Decision at 6.  We find no error in that conclusion.  The evidence reflects that \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in October 2019 and authorized an agency to \nmake $5 payments towards the student loans in November 2019. GE 1 and AE I. The Judge\u2019s \nconclusion in question is a reasonable inference drawn from the record evidence. Overall, \nApplicant has not directed our attention to anything in the record that would likely persuade a \nreasonable person that the Judge was biased. Applicant has failed to meet the heavy burden on \nhim to rebut the presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18\u00ad\n02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020).  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.

On December 16, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant \nof the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision without a hearing. On August 10, 2021, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nJuan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 11 delinquent debts totaling about $24,500. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with comments. The Judge \nfound in favor of Applicant on three of the allegations totaling about $1,700 and found against her \non the remaining allegations. The Judge concluded that, while Applicant has begun making \nprogress in addressing her delinquent debts, she has not established a sufficient track record of \npayments to mitigate the alleged security concerns.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents that were not presented to the Judge for \nconsideration, including one that postdates the Judge\u2019s decision. The Appeal Board is prohibited \nfrom considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nIn her brief, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings regarding two SOR debts, one was \na medical debt of $152 and the other a medical debt of $498. Her challenge regarding the latter \ndebt need not be addressed because the Judge found in favor of her on that debt.  \nRegarding her other challenge, Applicant correctly points out the Judge erred in finding \nshe presented no documentary evidence of making payments towards the $152 debt. In her \nresponse to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material, Applicant presented documentation \nconfirming she was making regular payments towards this debt. Considering the small amount of \nthis debt, the Judge\u2019s error was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  \nSee, e.g., ADP Case No. 13-01074 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2014). \nApplicant asks the Board to reconsider the Judge\u2019s decision. The Board does not review a \ncase de novo. The scope of our review is limited to addressing material issues raised by the parties \nto determine whether harmful error occurred.

On \nFebruary 1, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handing Protected Information) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 13, 2021, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his late forties, has been working for defense contractors for about 17 years, \nand has held a security clearance for most of that employment. \nUnder Guideline K, the SOR \nalleged three security violations, which were cross-alleged in a single Guideline E allegation. \nApplicant admitted the Guideline K allegations but denied the Guideline E allegation.  Applicant \nadmitted he sent classified information on three occasions to fellow employees on an unclassified \nnetwork. These incidents occurred in 2008, 2013, and 2017. Regarding the first incident, he \nadmits he \u201ccut corners\u201d in sending the email. Decision at 2. His actions during this incident were \ndeliberate. For this incident, he received a written warning. The second incident involved him \nsending unclassified information in the email that when combined together constituted classified \ninformation.  His actions during this incident were negligent, and he received a verbal reprimand. \nApplicant attributed the third incident to a systemic problem with his employer\u2019s system for \nhandling classified information. His action during this incident were inadvertent, and he received \na verbal and written warning.   \n\u201cAlthough Applicant\u2019s most recent security clearance violation may have been inadvertent; \nthere appears to also be a negligent pattern here. Such a pattern cannot be condoned when handling \nclassified information.\u201d Decision at 4. \u201cIt cannot be said that a similar security clearance violation \nis unlikely to occur.\u201d Decision at 6. None of the Guideline K or E mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the alleged security concerns.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends \u201cthe Judge erred in some of his findings of fact.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. \nHowever, he does not identify any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact that are purportedly \nerroneous. This assignment of error fails for lack of specificity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. ISCR \nCase No. 17-03372 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018) (explaining why assignments of error must be \nset forth with sufficient specificity to permit review on appeal). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also contends the Judge found that certain of his security violations were \n\u201cinadvertent[,] but failed to find for him on those allegations.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. To the extent \nthat Applicant is arguing that negligent security violations may not be disqualifying, we find no \nmerit in that argument. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 33 provides, \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure \nto comply with rules and regulations for handling of protected information\u2015which includes \nclassified and other sensitive government information, and proprietary information\u2015raises doubt \nabout an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgement, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d See also ISCR Case No. 18-00496 \nat 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019) (simple negligence in the handling of classified information can be a \nmatter of grave security concern).   \nApplicant further argues the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by not properly \nweighing the evidence, and by not correctly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person \nconcept. In his arguments, for example, he contends that his security violations were not recent or \nfrequent, that they happened under unusual circumstances making them unlikely to recur, and that \nthey resulted in no compromise of classified information. He also claims his security violations \nwere the result of inadequate training or unclear procedures, and \u201c[he] has had training after each \nincident and did not repeat the mistake again.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 7.  Additionally, he appears to be \narguing the three incidents do not show a pattern of negligence because they are distinguishable \nfrom each other. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption \nthat the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020).  \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.
